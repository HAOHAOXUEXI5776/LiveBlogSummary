                "however , the irish credit rating is probably safe in the short term , at least .", 
                "here 's the full statement : the uk vote to leave the european union is negative for ireland , raising risks to growth and creating uncertainty around future relations with northern ireland , fitch ratings says .", 
                "it is unlikely to have any immediate implications for ireland 's sovereign rating in the near term , but a medium-term rating impact would be possible if the economic dislocation of brexit were to prove severe .",

                "for example , the uk accounts for 49 % of irish agricultural exports .", 
                "a uk slowdown , sterling depreciation and potential future trade barriers between ireland and the uk would weigh on irish exports , economic growth and employment ; although the full impact will only become clear as eu-uk negotiations develop .", 
                "we think the most important near-term impact will be through reduced domestic confidence .", 
                "in the medium term , ireland could gain from a shift of some foreign direct investment from the uk to the eu or from international businesses relocating from the uk , but this is highly uncertain .",

                "ireland 's commitment to fiscal consolidation during and after its eu-imf programme leads us to think an increase in fiscal risks would be met with a policy response to continue meeting fiscal targets and limiting the impact on public debt dynamics .",
