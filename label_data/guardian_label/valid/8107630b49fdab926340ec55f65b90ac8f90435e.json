                "we were promised man haron monis ' associates ; we got a former house mate , the guy who cut his hair , and a refugee who met the sydney siege gunman for about 10 minutes one time in 2010 .", 
                "alas , monis was a man with few friends , and so the we 're getting is a frustratingly limited one .", 
                "nonetheless , here 's what we learned on wednesday : monis would keep his room locked , a former house mate has told the inquest , and banned any people from visiting the house .", 
                "he asked his house mate not to answer the door if someone knocked .", 
                "monis would borrow money from the former house mate , amin khademi , and once asked him to paint a yagoona warehouse for him free of charge .", 
                "he would just say i need money , but he would n't give a reason , khademi said .", 
                "the gunman , who claimed to be a senior cleric in iran , sometimes misstated basic islamic blessings , according to hassan ammar , a muslim australian who reached out to monis when he first arrived in the country .", 
                "ammar concluded that monis was full of an iraqi former refugee , who was visited by the gunman in villawood detention centre in 2010 , said monis instructed him and other asylum seekers : just be patient inside , do n't make trouble , i think you will get your visa as soon as possible .", 
                "monis had a bank of cameras set up inside the office in which he conducted his spiritual healing business , his former barber has said .", 
                "he told the barber , anthony hancock , he did white magic and spells but only good magic , white magic , the inquest heard .", 
                "the cousin of monis 's girlfriend at the time of the siege said his introduction to their family was awkward because he avoided answering questions and refused to be photographed .", 
                "the cousin eventually grew sus enough to call the immigration department and the anti-terrorism hotline .", 
                "we would leave there feeling awkward , sus like this guy was hiding something , but we did n't know what , she said .",
