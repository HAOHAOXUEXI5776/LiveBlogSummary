                "hillary clinton and tim kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency as she releases her 2015 personal tax return and builds on the clintons ' tradition of making their returns public since 1977 and kaine releases 10 years of his returns , campaign communications director jenn palmieri said in a statement .", 
                "in stark contrast , donald trump is hiding behind fake excuses and backtracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns , palmieri continued .",

                "trump , clinton 's republican opponent , has steadfastly refused to release any of his personal tax information , citing legal advice from trump organization counsel not to publicly disclose his tax returns before the completion of an audit .", 
                "in 2015 , the clintons paid an effective federal income tax rate of 34.2 % on an adjusted gross income of $ 10,594,529 .", 
                "adding an effective state and local income tax rate of 9.0 % , the couple 's total tax rate was 43.2 % .", 
                "the clintons donated $ 1,042,000 , or 9.8 % of their adjusted gross income , to charity .", 
                "kaine and holton had an adjusted gross income of $ 313,441 , and paid a total of 25.6 % in tax .", 
                "the clinton campaign released a table showing the effective tax rates paid by kaine and holton since 2006 , although they did not release one for the clintons : tim kaine and anne holton 's tax rates since 2006 campaign presidential candidates are not legally required to release their tax returns , although the practice has been the norm for more than four decades .", 
                "trump 's critics have speculated that the real estate tycoon is hiding his tax returns because they may reveal that he has vastly overstated his personal wealth , has unsavory business ties with the russians or may be stingy with charitable donations , or some combination thereof .", 
                "trump 's tax rate itself has been posited as a possible reason for the campaign 's reticence - the new york times today floated the possibility that trump may pay zero federal income tax in some years .",
