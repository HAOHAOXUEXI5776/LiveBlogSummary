                "at that point the information about the fact there was an investigation into hsbc account holders was in the public domain , and so there was no big secret about this .", 
                "in terms of the conversations that were had specifically of course i was not privy to that , but there is no suggestion that lord green had acted improperly , was complicit in tax evasion or was involved in this particular activity and that could not be clearer there is no evidence that lord green was complicit in any wrong doing and that point remains the case .", 
                "opposition members can stand up and make allegations and suggestions but there is no evidence that he was engaged in that type of behaviour and certainly no information that was available to ministers to suggest that that was the case .",

                "during a hearing which saw hodge criticise homer severely and repeatedly , hodge accused hmrc of not doing enough to recover money lost through tax evasion and to prosecute offenders .", 
                "she said : it 's pretty outrageous what was going on .", 
                "it 's the first time in many of these leaks that there are really strong allegations not of egregious tax avoidance , but of tax evasion , and that is incredibly serious .", 
                "for you to sit there and say , as you are doing , that 'we could n't get the money in in the same way as the french and spanish did ' and 'we did n't litigate because we wanted to get the money in ' and yet you did worse on the money - it leaves me believing that you are not serving the british taxpayer .",

                "and there were another 400 to 500 cases where people were pursued for settlement .", 
                "around two thirds of the people identified had paid the right amount of tax , she said .", 
                "jennie grainger , hmrc 's director general for enforcement and compliance , told mps that it was hard to prosecute in these cases .",

                "one of the challenges - and particularly in a situation when you have stolen data , which is what this is - is that you have to be able to prove those facts another way in order for the cps to be able to take it forward .",
