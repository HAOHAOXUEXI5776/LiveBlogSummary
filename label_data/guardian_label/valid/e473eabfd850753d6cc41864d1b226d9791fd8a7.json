                "in an extract released this afternoon from a speech he will give tomorrow mandelson said : there 's an increasing tendency from brexiters to damn anyone who deigns takes the opposing argument as having no right to do so .", 
                "boris johnson 's attack on president obama is a classic of the genre .",

                "thirdly , this is the seventh out of ten icm phone polls since the 2015 general election which recalls voting in ed miliband as prime minister .", 
                "unfortunately the ability of recall by past vote weighting to correct for this is mitigated on this occasion ( and thus has only a negligible counter-impact ) , by a sizable and unusual number of 2015 conservative voters transitioning to labour on future intentions .",
