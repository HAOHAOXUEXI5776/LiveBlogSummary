                "david davis , the brexit secretary , said eu migration may rise some years after brexit under the government 's plans .", 
                "in response to a question about whether there would be a cap on the number of eu nationals coming to the uk after brexit , he replied : i can not imagine that the policy will be anything other than that which is in the national interest , which means that from time to time we 'll need more , from time to time we 'll need less migrants .", 
                "that is how it will no doubt work .", 
                "and that will be in everybody 's interests , the migrants and the citizens of the united kingdom .", 
                "he said that he still thought the government would be able to achieve its target of getting annual net migration below 100,000 at some point .", 
                "but he went on : but the simple truth is that we have to manage this problem .", 
                "you 've got industry dependent on migrants .", 
                "you 've got social welfare , the national health service .", 
                "you have to make sure they continue to work .",

                "asked about this claim , he said : the prime minister said we are coming to the end of the time when we are paying enormous sums to the eu .", 
                "we will , of course , meet our international obligations but we expect also our rights to be respected too .", 
                "i do n't think we are going to be seeing that sort of money change hands .", 
                "he said that leaving the eu without a deal would be not as easy as some would have you believe '' but a lot better '' than critics have claimed .", 
                "he said that when theresa may spoke of no deal being better than a bad deal , she was responding to claims that some eu countries might try to impose a punitive deal on the uk .", 
                "the government wanted a deal , he stressed .", 
                "our aim is a comprehensive free-trade agreement , that 's what we are after , because that is much better than anything else .",

                "we are aiming to get the best possible deal with europe and the best possible deal with the rest of the world .", 
                "that 's what this country needs .", 
                "but when davis spoke in the commons last year , what he said sounded more like a commitment than an aspiration .", 
                "he said : what we have come up with is the idea of a comprehensive free trade agreement and a comprehensive customs agreement that will deliver the exact same benefits as we have , but also enable my right honourable friend the secretary of state for international trade to go and form trade deals with the rest of the world , which is the real upside of leaving the european union .", 
                "he suggested that theresa may had ruled out paying money to the eu for single market access after brexit .",
