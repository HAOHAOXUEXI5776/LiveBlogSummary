                "iain duncan smith , the conservative former work and pensions secretary , has urged ministers to abandon planned cuts to universal credit worth \u00e2\u00a3 3.4bn .", 
                "speaking in a commons debate , he said that this was a subject close to my heart and that work allowances - the amount people can earn before losing universal credit - were crucial .", 
                "he went on : if we really want to see the right thing happen to people out there who try and get into work and stay in work , the allowances are critical .", 
                "and i would recommend and hope that my colleagues in government will think very carefully again about the decision to reduce those allowances .", 
                "i recognise the problem with the deficit and of course we want to reduce that , and i 'm not asking for more money .", 
                "i 'm asking for wiser spending of the money we have a very good opportunity now to do something that is really bold , and bold and right for those that we really want to improve the lives of , which the prime minister rightly said was her target group .", 
                "it is a very conservative thing to do to help people who are doing the right thing to improve their lives .", 
                "duncan smith said if the government can not reverse the proposed cuts for everyone affected it should prioritise single parents and the disabled .", 
                "he went on : i urge my colleagues , my honourable friends , to do just this , it is the right thing to do , it will be the thing to do that changes lives and improves the quality of those lives .", 
                "he was speaking in a debate on a labour motion saying the proposed \u00e2\u00a3 3.4bn work allowance cuts and a \u00e2\u00a3 1.4bn cut to employment and support allowance ( a disability benefit ) should be reversed .", 
                "labour 's motion has just been defeated .", 
                "pollsters underestimated the strength of the leave vote in the eu referendum because they failed to up the extent to which the less educated were prepared to back brexit , a leading polling expert has said .", 
                "professor john curtice - whose exit poll in the 2015 general election was the first to indicate an overall conservative victory - said the way people voted in the referendum was different to the way they vote in general elections .", 
                "as the press association reports , he told a briefing organised by natcen social research : there was a very substantial difference by education in people 's willingness to vote leave or remain .", 
                "this was a referendum which was essentially between the social liberals and the social conservatives in our society , which is rather different division from the one the opinion polls are usually trying to estimate , which is between left and right .", 
                "that is a division which is centred much more around class than around education .", 
                "exiled islanders will not be allowed to resettle on the british-controlled chagos islands , the government has announced .", 
                "in a commons written statement sir alan duncan , a foreign office minister , said : the manner in which the chagossian community was removed from the territory in the 1960s and 1970s , and the way they were treated , was wrong and we look back with deep regret .", 
                "we have taken care in coming to our final decision on resettlement , noting the community 's emotional ties to biot [ british indian ocean territory ] and their desire to go back to their former way of life .", 
                "this comprehensive programme of work included an independent feasibility study followed by a full public consultation in the uk , mauritius and the seychelles .", 
                "i am today announcing that the government has decided against resettlement of the chagossian people to the british indian ocean territory on the grounds of feasibility , defence and security interests , and cost to the british taxpayer .", 
                "in coming to this decision the government has considered carefully the practicalities of setting up a small remote community on low-lying islands and the challenges that any community would face .", 
                "these are significant , and include the challenge of effectively establishing modern public services , the limited healthcare and education that it would be possible to provide , and the lack of economic opportunities , particularly job prospects .", 
                "the government has also considered the interaction of any potential community with the us naval support facility a vital part of our defence relationship .", 
                "the government will instead seek to support improvements to the livelihoods of chagossians in the communities where they now live .", 
                "i can today announce that we have agreed to fund a package of approximately \u00e2\u00a3 40m over the next ten years to achieve this goal .", 
                "the scottish parliament is to seek expenses from independence campaigners who camped out on its grounds after spending more than \u00e2\u00a3 100,000 on legal action .", 
                "as the press association report , the indycamp group were evicted from the site earlier this month after losing an appeal against their removal .", 
                "the parliament spent \u00e2\u00a3 105,890 of public money on the legal action , including more than \u00e2\u00a3 67,000 on the petition for the campers ' removal and more than \u00e2\u00a3 38,000 fighting their unsuccessful appeal .",

                "michael chessum , the group 's national organiser ( and a member of momentum 's steering committee ) , said : we would not support using parliament to directly block brexit - but what is the point of our mps having the right to vote on article 50 if they do not use it to extract concessions against hard brexit ?",

                "and doing it effectively means retaining parliamentary leverage over article 50 .", 
                "the group also criticises mcdonnell for saying in his speech that opposing brexit or even delaying article 50 would place labour against the majority will of the british people and on the side of certain corporate elites , who have always had the british people at the back of the queue .",

                "they are given to people who will contribute to the lords , and the argument for giving farage a peerage is based on the fact that ukip have only three peers in the lords ( all defectors , not people appointed as ukip peers ) despite coming third in terms of vote at the general election , whil the lib dems have 104 peers .",
