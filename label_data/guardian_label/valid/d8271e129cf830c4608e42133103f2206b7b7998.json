                "it is me being very clear .", 
                "in his speech he said that there would not be year-on-year cuts in most departmental budgets until the deficit was eliminated .",

                "he claimed that it would be wrong to be too prescriptive about likely cuts before the general election .", 
                "now , beyond that , the right way to make these decisions is frankly in government , when you have all of the resources behind you .",
