                "here are the main points from theresa may 's statement theresa may has confirmed that the the uk will continue to be bound by european court of justice rulings for at least some of the government 's planned brexit transition .", 
                "she also admitted that there was a theoretical possibility of the uk having to implement new eu rules introduced during this period , although she claimed that in practice it was highly unlikely '' that any new eu legislation would come into force not already in the pipeline .", 
                "( see 5.40pm .", 
                ") this was implicit in what may said in her florence speech , and the eu brexit negotiating guidelines say the eu will only offer a transition allowing continued access to the single market on condition that the uk agrees to remain bound by eu law during this period .", 
                "but may has until now never been so explicit about this , and some tory pro-brexiteers were unhappy with her language .", 
                "may has firmed up her claim that the government is prepared to leave the eu with no brexit deal if necessary .", 
                "although this has always been part of her brexit stance , her 'no deal is better than a bad deal ' rhetoric goes down badly in brussels and she omitted this from the text of her florence speech .", 
                "but today she published brexit papers on trade and customs showing that the government is actively making continency plans for this eventuality .", 
                "( see 5.47pm . ) .", 
                "and she told mps : while i believe it is profoundly in all our interests for the negotiations to succeed , it is also our responsibility as a government to prepare for every eventuality , so that is exactly what we are doing .", 
                "these white papers also support that work , including setting out steps to minimise disruption for businesses and travellers .", 
                "the government has admitted in its trade white paper that it does not expect to be able to implement new trade deals during the brexit transition .", 
                "instead it will pursue '' trade negotiations with other countries during the transition , with a view to implementing them later .", 
                "may has refused to deny receiving legal advice saying article 50 can be revoked .", 
                "( see 5.14pm . )", 
                "may has repeated her claim that it is up to the eu to break the stalemate in the brexit talks , despite the european commission saying the uk had to take the initiative .", 
                "overnight number 10 released words from may saying the ball was in the eu 's court .", 
                "asked about this margaritis schinas , the european commission 's chief spokesman , said : there is a clear sequencing to these talks .", 
                "there has been so far no solution found on step one , which is the divorce proceedings , so the ball is entirely in the uk court for the rest to happen .", 
                "but may later told mps : as we look forward to the next stage , the ball is in their [ the eu 's ] court .", 
                "may has struggled to explain why some ministers say the uk will leave the single market and the customs union during the transition when her plan is effectively for the uk to stay in .", 
                "several labour mps asked her about this .", 
                "in response to ed miliband she said : as we leave the european union in march 2019 we will leave full membership of the customs union and full membership of the single market .", 
                "what we then want is a period of time when practical changes can be made as we move towards the end state - the trade agreement - that we will have agreed with the european union .", 
                "we have to negotiate for that implementation period what the arrangements would be .", 
                "we have suggested that that should be a new agreement , an agreement that we should be able to operate on the same basis and on the same rules and regulations .", 
                "the labour mp chuka umunna said may was not making any sense at all '' on this point .", 
                "( may sounded like someone who wants to stay in the single market and customs union during the transition , but just not call it that . )", 
                "she brushed aside a call to create an inner cabinet '' to take control of brexit .", 
                "when the tory mp nicholas soames proposed this , may said : we have the government ministers meet in a variety of forms to consider these particular issues .", 
                "before the florence speech i was pleased the whole cabinet came together and signed up to that speech , and of course we have various discussions about the various elements of the negotiations .", 
                "but i can assure you that what we 're aware of is the need to make sure we can make swift decisions when that is necessary in the negotiating process .", 
                "jeremy corbyn told mps that , 16 months after the referendum , the government had made no real progress '' on brexit .", 
                "he said : sixteen months on from the referendum , no real progress has been made .", 
                "just at the moment when britain needs a strong negotiating team , we have a cabinet at each other 's throats .", 
                "half of the conservative party want the foreign secretary sacked , the other half want the chancellor sacked .",
