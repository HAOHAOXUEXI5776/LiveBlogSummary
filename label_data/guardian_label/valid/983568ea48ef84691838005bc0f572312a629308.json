                "he said there was not an atmosphere within europe for change , which would require lengthy procedures in each of the 28 member states , with some legally obliged to put the proposals to a public referendum .",

                "here is a summary of the main points from john whittingdale 's response to the urgent question on fifa .", 
                "whittindale hinted that the government could back england hosting an alternative world cup in 2018 in the light of the ongoing scandal at fifa .", 
                "but he said that britain would have to act with countries from europe and elsewhere .", 
                "if there were any serious attempt to organise an alternative to the existing world cup , that could only be done if there were a strong agreement across the european nations , and preferably with other football associations from around the world .", 
                "so the first thing that needs to be done is for that to be discussed within uefa .", 
                "he said there was no point england boycotting the 2018 world cup on its own .", 
                "asked about england hosting an alternative tournament , he said it had been in a very credible bid for the 2018 tournament .", 
                "but he stressed that this was an issue on which the football associations had to take the lead , he said .", 
                "he said he had spoken to greg dyke , chair of the football association , and would be meeting him later this week .", 
                "dyke will be talking to uefa colleagues about this , he said .", 
                "whittingdale said that sepp blatter 's credibility as fifa president had been utterly destroyed and that he should resign .", 
                "fifa 's voting system is designed to support the incumbent and it returned a predictable result but there is no doubt that what remained of sepp blatter 's credibility has been utterly destroyed .", 
                "whittingdale said that blatter had presided over a culture of kickbacks and corruption that risk ruining international football for a generation .", 
                "chris bryant , the shadow culture secretary , said that blatter was a tainted leader of a corrupt organisation and that he only survived last week because of his mafioso cronyism .", 
                "whittingdale said that pressure on blatter was growing and he urged others to support the campaign to force him out .", 
                "the mere fact that more than 70 national associations felt able to back a rival candidate shows that momentum against [ blatter ] is building .", 
                "we must now increase that pressure still further .", 
                "it is up to everyone who cares about football to use whatever influence they have to make this possible .", 
                "i am sure that fans the world over will be increasingly vocal in their condemnation of the blatter regime and fifa 's sponsors need to think long and hard about whether they want to be associated with such a discredited and disgraced organisation .", 
                "for the good of the game we must work together to bring about change .", 
                "for the good of the game it is time for sepp blatter to go .", 
                "whittingdale said sponsor should go much further in terms of putting pressure on fifa for change .", 
                "visa has already made a strong statement .", 
                "other sponsor have indicated their unhappiness , but certainly we would like them to go much further .", 
                "david beckham was a key member of england 's bid to host the 2018 world cup .",
