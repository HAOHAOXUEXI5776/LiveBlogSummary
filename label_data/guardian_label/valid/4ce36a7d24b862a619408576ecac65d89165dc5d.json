                "if it does emerge that isis caused the crash , we need to ask , first of all , how isis came to this capability and , secondly , why it has persistently withheld any real evidence of its claims .", 
                "in answering the first question , the ability to pull off an operation like this could be a boon of isis 's caliphate model and the internationalised operational capabilities it presents .",

                "among other things , egypt 's tourism industry would be hit immensely hard ; air travel the world over would suffer ; and security restrictions would likely be revamped and maximised .",

                "after all , it would mean that isis had resolutely trumped al-qaida , and would likely lead russia to step up its anti-isis military campaign both things that would boost its recruitment efforts dramatically .",
