                "just after midnight in baghdad , we 're going to close our rolling coverage of the first day of the battle for mosul , the largest military operation in iraq since 2011 , with a summary of the last 24 hours ' events .", 
                "the first day of a long awaited mission to retake mosul from the islamic state ( isis ) ended with iraqi forces ahead of schedule , according to the pentagon .", 
                "by midday they had achieved roughly what they had intended to do , spokesman peter cook said .", 
                "it 's day one , it 's early , but this had kicked off certainly the way the iraqis had hoped .", 
                "starting at about 6am baghdad time , about 30,000 coalition forces advanced on mosul : iraqi troops from the south , kurdish peshmerga from the east and us air strikes and ground special forces supporting both .", 
                "some 6,000 jihadi militants , some who set oil and tire fires to hide their positions in smoke , are believed to be in the city .", 
                "by 10pm local time , kurdish president massoud barzani said the peshmerga had taken approximately 80 miles ( 200km ) of territory from isis , and commanders said they had cleared nine villages .", 
                "isis militants laid ieds throughout the towns and sent a series of suicide attacks on kurdish and iraqi forces , slowing the march .", 
                "near mosul , the guardian 's martin chulov saw a fighter jet engaged in a kind of cat and mouse game with a very active isis mortar team , and throughout the day isis fought iraqi and kurdish forces with small arms and artillery .", 
                "the pentagon said about 5,000 american military personnel are in iraq , and that special forces are advising iraqi and kurdish units and guiding strikes , some near the outskirts of the city .", 
                "we are crystal clear that americans are in harm 's way in iraq , but they are not in a lead role , cook said .", 
                "one resident told the guardian that isis militants are trying to hide among civilians , storing ieds in family homes , and are riding through the city on motorcycles to evade airstrikes .", 
                "people have had enough in mosul , he said .", 
                "we have seen too many beheadings , people being drowned in cafes , thrown from buildings .",

                "the united nations and aid groups fear a humanitarian crisis of as many as 700,000 people .", 
                "the groups have set up refugee camps , able to hold about 60,000 people , in nearby kurdish-held territory .", 
                "iraqi prime minister haider al-abadi addressed the nation early monday , telling residents in mosul : these forces that are liberating you today , they have one goal in mosul , which is to get rid of daesh and to secure your dignity .", 
                "they are there for your sake .", 
                "the coalition against isis intends to drop seven million leaflets in 48 hours over the city , which cook said would either warn civilians how to flee or have some specific guidance as to the safest place to be in your homes , if there 's air strikes or artillery or if the fight comes to be in your neighborhood .", 
                "residents and saudi arabia 's foreign minister warned against allowing shia militias join the fight against isis , for fears of the sectarian violence that so traumatized iraq in the civil war of the 2000s .", 
                "mosul 's post-isis fate is also uncertain : it could become a humanitarian crisis , and the city has significance to kurds and sunni and shia arabs .",
