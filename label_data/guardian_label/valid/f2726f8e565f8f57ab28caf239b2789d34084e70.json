                "if you want a sense of the painstaking efforts behind the win , here 's one of yesterday 's newly minted laureates , rainer weiss , on the herculean task : it 's as long as 40 years of people thinking about this , trying to make a detections , sometimes failing \u0080\u00a6 and then slowly but surely getting the technology together to be able do it .", 
                "this morning , it 's the winners of the chemistry prize who will be revealed although it could well be molecular biologists or geneticists that scoop the award .", 
                "we 're expecting the name ( s ) to be announced at 10.45am uk time , from the royal swedish academy of sciences in stockholm .", 
                "do join us for the live announcements , explanations of the research , and reaction from the winners and others from the world of science ."
