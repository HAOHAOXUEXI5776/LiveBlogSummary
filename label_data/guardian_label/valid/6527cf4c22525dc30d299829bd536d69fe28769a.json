                "as the balance point between these risks has shifted over the past 9 months , that has left me judging that a partial withdrawal of the additional policy insurance the mpc put in place last year would be prudent relatively soon , provided the data come in broadly as expected in the period ahead .",

                "i do not think adding a twist or a turn from monetary policy would , in this environment , be especially helpful in building confidence , at least until the dust-cloud has started to settle .", 
                "provided the data are still on track , i do think that beginning the process of withdrawing some of the incremental stimulus provided last august would be prudent moving into the second half of the year .",
