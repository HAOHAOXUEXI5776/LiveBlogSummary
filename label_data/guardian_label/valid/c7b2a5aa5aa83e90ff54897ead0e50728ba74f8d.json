                "in the past minister have insisted the the uk will leave the single market and the customs union during the transition , although this has been widely dismissed as semantics because they have also signalled that in practical terms the uk is likely to remain signed up to single market and customs union rules during this period .", 
                "davis confirmed this today , using slightly more direct language than ministers have used in the past .", 
                "that prompted rees-mogg to ask him .", 
                "if on the 30 march 2019 the uk is subject to the european court of justice , takes new rules relating to the single market , is paying into the european budget , are we not a vassal state ?", 
                "rees-mogg also up on the fact that davis was talking about a transition '' at some points , rather than using the preferred downing street phase implementation period '' .", 
                "rees-mogg said this was significant .", 
                "transition is different , because transition means that we are de facto inside the european union for that period .", 
                "we are only actually out at the end of the transition .", 
                "that is a big shift in government policy , and a big move away from the vote in june 2016 .", 
                "responding to the question about the uk being a vassal state '' during the transition , davis said : if that were going to be the case in perpetuity , my answer would probably be yes .", 
                "but the answer , for a short time , no .", 
                "davis did not rule out the uk agreeing to accept new eu rules coming into force during the transition .", 
                "when rees-mogg asked him if this would happen , davis said that on average it takes 22 months for new eu laws to come into force , and that the eu is proposing a 21 month transition .",

                "one source in the sdlp said sinn fein was now more focussed on building its national profile and promoting its new leader in waiting , mary lou mcdonald , in the irish republic where the party is preparing for a possible general election later in 2018 .", 
                "conversely , an alliance source said most of the parties who will be involved in the talks at stormont today are already on an election footing '' as they expect the negotiations to fail , and subsequently karen bradley will legislate for a new election to a fresh assembly .", 
                "in an under-reported part of her speech last week alongside irish foreign minister simon coveney outside stormont castle , bradley had mentioned the possible of a new assembly election should the talks not produce a breakthrough .",
