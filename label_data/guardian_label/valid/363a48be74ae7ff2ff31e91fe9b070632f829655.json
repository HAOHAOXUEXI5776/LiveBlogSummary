                "he added that instagram now means that we see the world in square images rather than rectangular ones .", 
                "the most striking part of the whole session was when de pury recounted the story of artist tanya ling , who was offered her first art exhibition purely on the strength of her instagram feed ( which is beautifully curated - take a look ) .", 
                "she exhibited paintings and sculptures rather than photographs , and damien hirst stopped by and bought the lot .",
