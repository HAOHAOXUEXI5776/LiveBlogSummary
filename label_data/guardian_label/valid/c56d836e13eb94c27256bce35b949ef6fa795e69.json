                "here are the key points from greg clark 's commons statement on nissan .", 
                "clark implied that the government would go into brexit talks with the eu aiming to keep the uk in the customs union .", 
                "yesterday he told andrew marr that the government 's intention was to have continued access to the markets in europe and vice versa without tariffs and bureaucratic impediments '' .", 
                "andrew tyrie , the conservative chair of the commons treasury committee ( and a remain voter ) asked him if he accepted that being outside the customs union would mean exporters having to comply with rules of origin rules what would amount to bureaucratic impediments '' .", 
                "clark replied : it seems to me why would you not aim as a matter of negotiation to avoid bureaucratic impediments .", 
                "that seems to me common sense .", 
                "and this is what i set out .", 
                "nick herbert , another pro-remain tory , later put the same point to clark .", 
                "clark replied : what i was able to say is how you would go into a negotiation .", 
                "that seems to me to find common ground .", 
                "clark suggested that the government could seek different trading arrangements with the eu for different sectors of the economy .", 
                "he also implied there was a regional element to this .", 
                "in response to a question from the labour chair of the commons business committee , iain wright , clark said : it seems to that the the approach - not only that i intend to take , but that i am already taking - with the firms that are in our economy is to take time to meet them to understand the different needs of different sectors , so that we can be informed by them , as we form our negotiating mandate .", 
                "it will be different from sector to sector .", 
                "that 's obviously the case .", 
                "my commitment , which we will share when we meet in his committee , is through our industrial strategy to make sure that we not only have confidence for individual sectors , but individual places as well .", 
                "because there is a very interesting confluence there , and i think the investment in nissan is good for the sector , and good for sunderland and the north east .", 
                "hilary benn , the labour chair of the commons brexit committee , later put it to clark that his reply to wright implied some sectors of the economy might be offered tariff-free trade with the eu while others would not .", 
                "clark did not deny this , but just said it was not in his power to decide the outcome of the talks .",

                "( see 6.10pm . )",

                "that 's all from me for today .",

                "this support is available to firms for skills and training of the local workforce , for research and development and innovation - in line with eu and uk government rules .", 
                "since 2010 the government has invested \u00a3 400m into the uk automotive sector in this way and we will continue to invest hundreds of millions more over the coming years .",

                "all proposals are subject to rigorous external scrutiny by the independent industrial development advisory board and are reported on to parliament .", 
                "2 - we would continue our work with the automotive sector , including nissan at sunderland , to ensure that more of the supply chain can locate in the uk , and in close proximity to the major manufacturing sites .", 
                "in a previous post i established the local growth deals and the city deals which working with local enterprise partnerships , have provided a way in which local councils , businesses and the government can upgrade the sites , especially sites brought into use from dereliction , and to provide the infrastructure for small and medium-sized businesses that can supply these major companies .",

                "she told the programme .", 
                "well , it 's only technically correct if you 're looking at spending on nhs england and you add an extra year to the spending review and you also take account of the switch from other budgets that we would normally think of as health spending .", 
                "so , for example , you can only arrive at the \u00a3 10bn by shifting money from public health budgets and from health education and training , and also by changing the date at which you calculate real terms increases .", 
                "so , yes , you can see how they have arrived at the figure .", 
                "but the real figure we feel should be quoted at \u00a3 4.5bn which is considerably less that 's over the period of the spending review and that 's the period that we usually talk about increases in spending .",
