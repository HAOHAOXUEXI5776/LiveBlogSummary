                "hello and welcome to our coverage of the supreme court 's ruling that the constitution guarantees a right for same-sex couples to marry , a decision that has made gay marriage legal in all 50 states .", 
                "the court ruled 5-4 that the constitution requires a state to license a marriage between same-sex couples .", 
                "each of the dissenting justices wrote a dissent .", 
                "in 2013 the court struck down the defense of marriage act , a decision that prompted a slew of state and federal court cases around the country upholding the right to gay marriage and knocking down state bans .", 
                "but federal appeals courts disagreed about the legality of such bans , bringing the case in expanded scope before the supreme court .", 
                "same-sex marriage was legal in 36 states , and had a disputed status in alabama .", 
                "some states have sought to circumvent rulings that legalized same-sex marriage , as in north carolina , where magistrates can now cite religious reasons as legal cause to opt out of officiating same-sex marriages .", 
                "follow along here for analysis and updates on the ruling and reaction from around the us , with contributions from dan roberts and sabrina siddiqui in washington , nicky woolf at the stonewall inn in new york and amanda holpuch in ann arbor , michigan , among my colleagues ."
