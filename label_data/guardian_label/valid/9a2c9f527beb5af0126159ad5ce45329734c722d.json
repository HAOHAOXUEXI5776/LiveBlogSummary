                "as nicholas watt reports , in a speech designed to herald a fightback after facing criticism from labour mps , miliband promised to take on those forces as he said that banks and energy companies must be made to work in the public interest .", 
                "but the labour leader declined to endorse a claim by andy burnham , the shadow health secretary , that powerful vested interests have been behind the criticisms of him and his poll ratings in the past week .",

                "major , who will speak to the cdu 's main thinktank , the konrad adenauer stiftung , will say that europe could find itself sleepwalking into antagonisms it can not repair '' , which could lead to an irrevocable split .",

                "for some time now labour and the conservatives have been confused about how to handle ukip , torn between accommodation and confrontation .",

                "i 'll quote what he said at length .", 
                "unlike the tories , what we will never do is try to out-ukip ukip .", 
                "i think it is time we levelled with people about ukip .", 
                "they 've got away with it for too long .",

                "but i say to working people in this country , let 's really examine their vision .", 
                "because when you stop and look at it , it is not really very attractive .", 
                "and it is rooted in the same failed ideas that have let our country down .",

                "but come the general election , i do n't believe the people of britain will follow .", 
                "2 - miliband quite cleverly turned being monstered into the press into a virtue .", 
                "at one point in his interview on the bbc last night miliband seemed to come close to saying it was good his poll ratings were at a record low , because that allowed his mettle to be tested .", 
                "today he found a slightly better way of turning demonisation to his advantage .",

                "a reader of the press over the last week would conclude that miliband 's chances of winning the election are almost non-existent .", 
                "actually , that 's not true .",

                "his parents were both immigrants , they were both very radical ( his father is dead , but his mum is still alive ) , and his father was a marxist academic .", 
                "in the speech miliband did not talk about this directly .", 
                "but he clearly alluded to this in a passage where he said he was brought up to believe in the power of ideas and the need for change .", 
                "when i hear the stories of people who say this country is n't working for them and they do n't see a future , i do n't shrug my shoulders and say there 's nothing we can do .",

                "when powerful forces try to tell me no way '' , i answer : who says ? ''",
