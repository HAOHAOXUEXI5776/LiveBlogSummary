                "as promised , the 66 year old 's pristine , vegas-styled show is a party , of sorts perhaps more like the kind of party which starts with champagne in the jacuzzi and ends up on a shag pile .", 
                "it 's exactly the type of smooth sentimentality and silliness that a sunday afternoon audience at glastonbury deserves : from the gloriously gooey penny lover , to the chintzy you are my destiny and the funk triumph of brick house , richie , dressed in a black blazer adorned with a glittered trim , packs every single second of the show with unbridled pop theatrics .",

                "well aware of his camp charisma , he wins support from the crowd immediately , complimenting their ability to remember his lyrics , whipping them into a yobbish singalong for three times a lady , and triggering some bolshie dance moves during dancing on the ceiling .",
