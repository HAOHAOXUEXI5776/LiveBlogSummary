                "andrew marr ( left ) and former work and pensions secretary iain duncan smith overs/bbc/pa on osborne 's entire deficit reduction strategy , cutting benefits for working-age people while protecting those for pensioners the truth is yes we need to get the deficit down but we need to make sure we widen the scope of where we look to get that deficit down and not just narrow it down on working age benefits because otherwise it just looks like we see this as a pot of money , that it does n't matter because they do n't vote for us .", 
                "on talk of an attempted coup on downing street this is not personal i have no personal ambitions .",

                "i came into this government because i cared about welfare reform .", 
                "on the success of cameron and osborne i am concerned that this government that i want to succeed is not actually able to do the kind of things that it should because it has become too focused on narrowly getting the deficit down without being able to say where that should fall other than simply on those who i think progressively can less afford to have that fall on them .", 
                "i am resigning because i want my government to think again about this and get back to that position that i believe , which is about being a one nation [ party ] .",

                "his key argument today is that his desire to roll out those reforms was the only reason that he entered government - an ambition to drive a social justice agenda that would help people into work .", 
                "what he had n't realised was going to happen was the 2008 financial crash that would devastate the economic landscape in which he would enter the department for work and pensions .", 
                "duncan smith said he knew that government would require compromise but he wanted to do it in order to try to deliver his plans .", 
                "doing so under the cloak of austerity meant that welfare cuts became the overriding narrative , while universal credit was more seen as a huge , at time inefficient reform , which had its deadline pushed further and further back .", 
                "duncan smith says he could take the austerity agenda , but admitted that he was constantly under fire from the treasury .", 
                "despite his warm words for the prime minister and chancellor , his key argument he made this morning was that the conservatives were this morning is damning : to suggest that the leadership went brutally after welfare because the working poor were not a group that had or ever would vote tory .", 
                "critics of duncan smith would ask why he then accepted the scale of cutbacks for six years before stepping away .",

                "he said he had supported policies to help pensioners like the triple lock , but enough was enough .", 
                "the warning now is that there is a risk that government policy is drifting in a discretion that divides society rather than unites it .", 
                "which , however much he tried to avoid attacking his party , is a highly critical point.it shines a light on the way that the treasury has pitted the welfare bill against other departmental spending - because one thing is true : it is very popular to cut benefits .", 
                "labour has struggled itself with how to respond because the polling is so stark.duncan smith 's parting shot is to say the time has come for politics to rise above populism - and stop hurting the most vulnerable , just because it is easy to do so .",
