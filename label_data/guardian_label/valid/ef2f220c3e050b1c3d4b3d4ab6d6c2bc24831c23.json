                "but what is the long-term significance ?", 
                "here are some snap thoughts .", 
                "1 - economic competence matters , and theresa may and philip hammond have knocked a serious dent in theirs .", 
                "only last week an icm poll for the guardian showed may and hammond 31 points ahead of jeremy corbyn and john mcdonnell on the issue of economic competence .", 
                "it is almost certain that , the next time the question is asked ( this weekend for us , probably ) may and hammond 's ratings will have gone down .", 
                "this is a very big u-turn .", 
                "but it is also worth pointing out that most chancellor in recent years have had to do something similar .", 
                "when ken clarke was chancellor in 1994 , he had have an mini emergency budget after mps voted down an increase on vat in fuel that he had announced the previous year but that was just about to come into effect .", 
                "when alistair darling was chancellor , he had to spend \u00a3 2.7bn a few weeks after his 2008 budget reversing the impact of the abolition of the 10p rate of income tax that gordon brown had announced when he was chancellor the year before .", 
                "and george osborne had to abandon benefit cuts worth more than \u00a3 4bn less than a week after announcing them in his budget last year .", 
                "not all of these chancellors suffered a terminal hit to their reputation because 2 - u-turns , while never welcome , can cauterise a political problem .", 
                "may and hammond have at least closed down the risk of going into the next election being accused of having broken a key manifesto promise on tax .", 
                "3 - hammond has left himself with a \u00a3 2bn shortfall .", 
                "( see 11.57am . )", 
                "that is not welcome , but it is smaller than some of the other blackholes left in government finances by treasury u-turns .", 
                "( see 1 above . )", 
                "4 - major reform of the tax treatment of the self-employed has been delayed , but not cancelled .", 
                "it was telling that at pmqs may only spoke about not increasing nics during this parliament .", 
                "she has left the door open to reforming nics in this area , as experts suggest she should ( see 12.59pm ) , after the election .", 
                "5 - the u-turn illustrates the power of tory backbenchers .", 
                "may and hammond are explaining the u-turn as a matter of keeping an electoral promise , but it was also a reflection of simple maths .", 
                "more than a dozen tory mps had spoken out in public against the increase , meaning it had very little chance of being passed by the commons .", 
                "pro-european tories were unable to exercise any leverage when the article 50 bill was going through parliament , but may could not see off this rebellion .", 
                "that says something about how powerless the tory pro-european lobby is compared to the tory low-tax lobby .", 
                "6 - and it illustrates the power of the tory press too .", 
                "as prime minister may has done nothing to upset the daily mail , and today 's announcement suggests that she is not about to abandon a strategy that has served her well .", 
                "7 - cameron 's tax-lock promise at the last election is looking increasingly reckless .", 
                "at the time many commentators said it was irresponsible for a party to rule out potentially desirable tax increases over the next five years as david cameron and george osborne did .", 
                "winning an outright majority in 2015 was seen as a great triumph .", 
                "but , in the light of today 's announcement ( and the police investigation into party spending in south thanet and other constituencies ) , perhaps they were n't so clever in how they went about winning .", 
                "8 - parliament is infinitely better at speaking up for middle earners and the rich than it is at speaking up for the poor .", 
                "the impact of the nics increase was relatively mild in budgetary terms ( \u00a3 645m a year , at most ) and it mostly affected middle and high earners .", 
                "it did not survive a week .", 
                "yet tax credit cuts worth billions , which will impact the poor much more , both in cash terms and in proportional terms , are going to be implemented without tory mps blocking them ."
