                "speaking to sky news , smith said : this [ the lack of an apology ] will be used to support many of the right wing aspects of abe 's government and others in the japanese elite who would rather have a stronger miliary role for japan in east asia and would rather forget , and indeed deny , what happened in the 1930s and 1940s .", 
                "he pointed out that the former mayor of osaka , toru hashimoto , tweeted recently : the best effect of president obama 's visit to hiroshima is how japan will not have to apologise to china and south korea again .",
