                "forbes ' comments come after her colleague on the committee , andy haldane , said last month that it was fair to describe economics as being in crisis given a series of forecasting errors before and after the financial crash .", 
                "he described the collapse of lehman brothers as the economics profession 's michael fish moment - a reference to when the bbc weather forecaster predicted in 1987 that the uk would avoid a hurricane that went on to devastate large parts of southern england .", 
                "forbes said in her speech in leeds - where she is talking about the bank 's latest outlook in the inflation report - that there is certainly fodder for criticism .", 
                "the vast majority of economists and forecasters expected the uk economy to slow immediately after the uk voted to leave the european union , with some even predicting an outright recession .", 
                "most put substantial weight on the evidence that growth , and especially investment , tends to slow sharply in the face of heightened uncertainty .", 
                "i was on the more optimistic end of the forecasters , but i still expected to see at least some softening .", 
                "but this slowdown has not occurred - and it has now been over 7 months since the june vote growth may still slow as higher inflation reduces real incomes , or if negative supply effects related to the uk 's departure from the european union build over time .", 
                "signs of such a slowdown starting soon , however , are as yet few and far between .", 
                "but she , like several city economists of late , was quick to point out that the forecasts made for the uk voting to stay in the eu had turned out to be close to the mark .", 
                "referring to haldane 's michael fish remark , forbes said : you may have heard that uk economic forecasters have recently been less accurate than weathermen .", 
                "but i will show you that the bank of england has actually done quite well - that is , if you compare the uk 's recent performance to what was predicted in may based on the assumption that the uk would vote to remain in the european union the bottom line : the real economy , including the labour market , have performed largely as forecast last spring .", 
                "most economic measures ( except investment ) have matched or slightly outperformed our may expectations based on a remain vote .", 
                "the uk economy appears to have been largely resilient to brexit uncertainty .", 
                "the main exception is sterling and the nominal data - which indicate sharply higher inflation than expected last spring a chart from kristin forbes ' speech of england as for why the economy had proved so resilient to the vote , forbes listed several possible factors and said the uk had benefited from a series of fortunate events in the second half of 2016 .", 
                "supporting factors included bank of england action after the vote , including a rate cut , the pound 's depreciation , a stronger global economy , a higher minimum wage and less negative effects of heightened uncertainty than expected.talking about the bank 's forecasts for growth to be 2 % this year but slow next year , for inflation to rise and for unemployment to edge up , forbes said for her the key risks to that view were : how sterling 's depreciation affects inflation dynamics , how wages evolve , and how consumersrespond to slower real income growth ."

                "however , another group on the board argued that athens needed to tighten further to push its surplus up to 3.5 % of gdp , the level agreed in its last bailout .", 
                "in a rare statement , the imf says that : most executive directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal while some directors had different views on the fiscal path and debt sustainability most directors agreed that greece does not require further fiscal consolidation at this time , given the impressive adjustment to date which is expected to bring the medium-term primary fiscal surplus to around 1\u00e2\u00bd percent of gdp , while some directors favored a surplus of 3\u00e2\u00bd percent of gdp by 2018 .", 
                "here 's the statement : imf executive board concludes 2016 article iv consultation , and discusses ex post evaluation of greece 's 2012 extended fund facility imf board meetings are usually kept confidential , so we would n't normally know whether decisions are unanimous or not .", 
                "the unusual decision to reveal the split highlights the divisions over greece within the imf , which has n't joined the country 's third bailout , agreed in august 2015 .", 
                "last month , a leaked report showed that the imf believes greece 's debt pile is on track to swell to almost 300 % of gdp by 2060 - a profoundly unsustainable level ."
