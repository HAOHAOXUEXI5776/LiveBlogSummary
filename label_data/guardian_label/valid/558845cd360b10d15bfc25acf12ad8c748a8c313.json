                "neil henderson ( @ hendopolis ) sunday times : labour will bring back rent controls # tomorrowspaperstoday # bbcpapers but today there might be just as much interest in signs that are emerging suggesting that the tories are starting to panic .",

                "there is a story in the paper but , as often happens on a sunday these days , the jolliest account is in tim shipman 's red box email briefing briefing .", 
                "here 's an excerpt .", 
                "it all began with james kirkup 's piece in saturday 's telegraph that senior figures in the conservative party are already planning for a world after cameron and were even considering installing boris johnson as leader by acclamation after the election .", 
                "i up the same talk early last week with multiple sources talking about mysterious approaches to donors by senior figures in the party about whether boris might take over , all of which are of course vociferously denied by the powers that be .", 
                "today , marie woolf and i report in the sunday times that this is just the tip of the iceberg .", 
                "we both received unsolicited phone calls from mps all week saying that cabinet ministers and their supporters were already phoning around seeking their backing for leadership bids if cameron fails to get back into government .", 
                "separately mps , backed by influential donors , said they are prepared to engineer a coup against cameron by submitting letters of no-confidence in him after may 7 and planning a mass show of support '' for johnson if the tories lose .", 
                "a major donor , who declined to be named , said : boris is the only one who can win .", 
                "everyone knows what is going to happen in 10 days ' time .", 
                "if dave does n't make it we 'll get rid of him . ''",

                "two donors have criticised the campaign .", 
                "peter hall , an investment manager , who has given almost \u00a3 600,000 to the tory party since 2005 , criticised cameron 's curious lack of energy and belief in his campaign '' and called on him to unleash visceral passion and belief in his vision of the future '' and get down and dirty '' if he is to remain prime minister .", 
                "he added : if we do n't have a conservative government after may 7 it will be because of david cameron .", 
                "i see no powerful vision of the future provided by david cameron '' hugh osmond , the pizza express entrepreneur who gave almost \u00a3 115,000 to the tories between 2008 and 2011 , said : what would a cameron uk really look like ?", 
                "i 've just no idea .", 
                "i do n't find either of the campaigns the slightest bit inspiring .", 
                "they are utterly cynical , trying to woo those few extra electors their way . ''", 
                "a yougov poll has shown the tories would be doing better with boris johnson as leader , the sunday times reports ( paywall ) .", 
                "a yougov poll today shows the tories would move from two points behind labour to three points ahead if johnson were leader .", 
                "he is judged cameron 's best successor by 31 % , with theresa may , the home secretary , second on 13 % .", 
                "theresa may has told the mail on sunday having a labour government propped up by the snp would create the biggest constitutional crisis since the abdication '' .", 
                "neil henderson ( @ hendopolis ) mail on sunday : may - snp/lab pact 'worst crisis since abdication ' # tomorrowspaperstoday # bbcpapers cameron has written an article for the sunday telegraph saying a conservative government 's first queen 's speech would include plans to scrap human rights laws , to hold an eu referendum and to raise the income tax threshold to \u00a3 12,500 ( although the tax pledge would not be fully implemented until 2020 , the paper says ) .", 
                "lib dems vince cable has told the mail on sunday that he would be happy to work with the conservatives again in coalition .", 
                "why ?", 
                "because i 've realised it is possible to be business-like with them .", 
                "i can envisage a scenario in which i would stomach working with the tories if the situation required .", 
                "you have to let your head rule your heart .", 
                "the article implies that he would prefer this to a coalition with labour , although cable is not quoted saying that directly .", 
                "but he is quoted saying said a labour/snp government would be 'very dangerous and completely unacceptable ' .", 
                "we ca n't let small extreme tendencies dominate the country .", 
                "i speak as someone who has lived in scotland .",
