                "johnson insisted that he was focusing now on the big issues he had to deal with as foreign secretary .", 
                "he said : we can all spend an awfully long time going over lots of stuff that i 've written in the last 30 years - all of which , in my view , have been taken out of context , but never mind .", 
                "there are some serious issues before us today i 'm afraid that there is such a rich thesaurus now of things that i have said that have been , one way or another , through what alchemy i do not know , somehow misconstrued that it would really take me too long to engage in a full-blown itinerary or apology to all concerned .", 
                "and i think most people who read these things , in their proper context , can see exactly what was intended .",
