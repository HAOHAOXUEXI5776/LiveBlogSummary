                "simon stevens , the nhs england chief executive , has undermined theresa may 's claim to be funding health properly by flatly contradicting her assertion that the service has been given all the money it wants .", 
                "he made the point during an assertive appearance before the commons public accounts committee during which he also disagreed openly with chris wormald , permanent secretary at the department of health .", 
                "wormald said spending on health in the uk was in line with the oecd average .", 
                "stevens said that that was misleading because the oecd figures included countries like mexico , that the uk spent less than on health than comparable advanced nations , and that it spent 30 % less on health per head than germany .", 
                "may has repeatedly said that the nhs was given more than stevens requested when he set out his five-year plan .", 
                "but stevens denied this .", 
                "he told the mps : like probably every part of the public service we got less than we asked for in that process .", 
                "so i think it would be stretching it to say the nhs has got more than it asked for there are clearly very substantial pressures , and i do n't think it helps anybody to try and pretend that there are n't .", 
                "stevens , a former labour councillor and a health adviser to tony blair who was appointed to run nhs england by david cameron , was not asked about a times story claiming that no 10 aides think his unenthusiastic approach is contributing to problems in the nhs .", 
                "( see 9.21am . )", 
                "but his evidence , which also saw him demanding a more robust government response to the social care crisis , was interpreted as him fighting back .", 
                "( see 4.35pm . )", 
                "jeremy hunt , the health secretary , has claimed that labour 's proposals to scrap corporation tax cuts to release more money for health are mortally dangerous '' to the nhs .", 
                "speaking in a commons debate on the nhs called by labour he said : this reveals , i 'm afraid , a fundamental misunderstanding about how you fund the nhs .", 
                "corporation taxes are being cut so that we can boost jobs and strengthen the economy so that we can fund the nhs .", 
                "the reason we 've been able to protect and increase funding in the nhs in the last six years , when the party opposite was not willing to do so , is precisely because we 've created two million jobs and we 've given this country the fastest growing economy in the g7 - and that is even more important post-brexit .", 
                "so to risk that growth , which is what their proposal will do , would not just risk funding for the nhs - it 'd be dangerous for the economy and mortally dangerous for the nhs .", 
                "the chancellor , philip hammond , has attempted to pave the way for a smooth brexit by assuring germany that the uk has no desire to disrupt the eu during its divorce from brussels .",
