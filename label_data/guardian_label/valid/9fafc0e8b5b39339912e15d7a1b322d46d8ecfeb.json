                "as nicholas watt reports in the guardian , a government source said : we 've listened to the views expressed from mps across the house and agreed that we wo n't hold the referendum on the same day as legislature elections .", 
                "this is the first illustration we 've had this parliament of quite how vulnerable cameron is when the opposition can unite against him .", 
                "officially he has a majority of just 16 , but labour , the snp and the dup ( because elections to the northern ireland assembly are also taking place on the same day as the scottish elections next year ) were strongly opposed to the referendum clashing with the holyrood poll , and some tories were in their camp too , and , given the arithmetic , cameron knew that if this went to a vote this afternoon , defeat was inevitable .", 
                "but the fun is n't over .", 
                "there is another fight looming over whether to allow 16 and 17-year-olds to vote in the referendum , but that wo n't reach the commons until thursday .", 
                "this afternoon , as mps start debating the bill 's committee stage , cameron faces a revolt over his plan to exempt the referendum from the normal purdah '' rules that restrict government activity in the run-up to an election .", 
                "labour , the snp and tory rebels have all expressed concerns about this .", 
                "ministers are not likely to lose , because labour 's stance is more equivocal than the tory rebels ' and it looks as though they will not join forces if it comes to a vote .", 
                "also , as the guardian reports , ministers are expected to offer a concession today , firming up the promise from philip hammond , the foreign secretary , that the government will not spend taxpayers ' money on a massive leaflet campaign in the run-up to polling day .", 
                "but bernard jenkin , a conservative eurosceptic , told the today programme this morning that mps like him would not back down and would insist on purdah '' rules being included in the bill .", 
                "he told the programme : it 's about fairness and trust .", 
                "who will trust the result of this referendum if the government have been able to deploy their vast resources pushing propaganda through people 's letterboxes ?", 
                "it 's about journalists ringing up civil servants and saying 'what does the government mean by this ? '", 
                "and , instead of saying , as during a general election , 'i 'm sorry that 's a matter for the no campaign or the yes campaign ' the government uses its entire publicity machine to brief the media , to skew the battlefield in favour of their particular side of the debate .", 
                "i do n't think anybody in their right mind wants this .", 
                "i do n't think the government wants it .", 
                "i think they realise they have opened a bit of a pandora 's box .", 
                "they will be looking for a way to resolve this .", 
                "but the bottom line is they should restore purdah in this referendum bill and , if they want to bring forward amendments later in the bill to deal with particular concerns they have got , let 's talk about that .", 
                "but we ca n't back down on this amendment [ the one saying purdah '' should be included in the bill ] .", 
                "i 'll be covering the debate in detail .", 
                "here is the agenda for the day .", 
                "9.30am : inflation figures are released .", 
                "11.30am : george osborne , the chancellor , takes questions in the commons .", 
                "12.30pm : mps start debating the eu referendum bill .", 
                "as usual i will be covering the breaking political news as it happens , as well as bringing you the best reaction , comment and analysis from the web .",
