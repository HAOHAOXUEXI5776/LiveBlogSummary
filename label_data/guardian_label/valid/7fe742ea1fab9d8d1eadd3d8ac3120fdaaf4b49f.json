                "i 've covered what he said about internet surveillance in some detail because , until now , attention has largely focused on how divided the conservatives and the lib dems are over the so-called snooper 's charter .", 
                "as clegg made clear , on other internet surveillance issues the two parties are much closer .", 
                "nick clegg said he supported david cameron in his attempt to try to ensure that the state can always access internet communications used by terrorists .", 
                "he said that the debate on this had been mangled '' since cameron spoke on this last week , but that he supported the key point cameron was making .", 
                "as it happens what david cameron has been going on about in the last few days is nothing to do with keeping mrs miggins ' website record of her visits to the local garden centre website [ ie , the communications data bill ] ; it 's actually been about this issue of how you intrude on the communications of terrorists , or would-be terrorists , something the principle of which - there 's lot of technical complexity - the principle of which no one is going to disagree with .", 
                "clegg said he accepted that further legislation in this area may be necessary .", 
                "one issue is , do we as a society , as a government , as a state , and the police and the security services , should they retain the right to , and be given extra powers if necessary , to listen in to the communications , on all sorts of different platforms , and they change all the time , of people who want to do us harm ?", 
                "of course .", 
                "i 've defended that .", 
                "and we 've updated our laws .", 
                "i 've supported fast-track legislation this summer to do that .", 
                "clegg said that cameron would be raising this issue in his talks with president obama .", 
                "they were concerned about people who pose a threat to security and ensuring there are no dark places where they can hide '' , clegg said .", 
                "he said the british were dependent on american companies a great deal for their internet communication services and that cameron would be talking to obama about ensuring that american firms cooperate more with british authorities .", 
                "we rely very heavily as a country on their cooperation ; for instance , where there 's an encrypted service - and having encrypted services are important , because we do n't want any of us to become subject to hacking from criminal gangs and so on , so encryption is just a fact of life ; you ca n't undo encryption - you can ensure that you cooperate with the companies , that where you want to break that encryption , find out what nasty people are saying too each other , we can do so .", 
                "but he said this issue was not the same as the proposal in the draft communications data bill to store information about internet searches .", 
                "he was still opposed to that , he said .", 
                "actually the communications data bill was not about listening in .", 
                "it was simply about saying every single website , every single social media interaction you do every year , should be stored somewhere .", 
                "and i do n't think constructing some vast , gargantuan database which records what mrs miggins in 36 orchard close has done when she 's gone on to her waitrose website for a year - do i think that 's a sensible use of the statute book , or our time and resources ?", 
                "interestingly , he did not refer to the communications data bill as the snooper 's charter , which is what the lib dems usually call it .", 
                "yesterday theresa may , the home secretary , complained this term was highly misleading .", 
                "clegg ridiculed david cameron 's stance on televised leaders ' debates .", 
                "this cheery-eyed compassion the conservatives have suddenly discovered for the green party is one of the more specious excuses i 've seen i think david cameron has put himself in an unsustainable , and actually slightly laughable position .", 
                "he said that , although cameron was saying he would only take part if the greens were included , the greens and ukip combined had as many mps as plaid cymru , half as many as the snp , and less than half as many as the dup - even though plaid , the snp and the dup are all being excluded .", 
                "he said the broadcasters should develop a bit of backbone '' and be willing to empty chair cameron if he refuses to participate .", 
                "i really do hope the broadcasters develop a bit of backbone on this , because they should n't be bullied by the conservatives throwing their weight around .",
