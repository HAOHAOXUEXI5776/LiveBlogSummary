                "some of the proposals on boosting the eu 's competitiveness and asserting the sovereignty of member states have proved relatively uncontroversial .", 
                "but plans for new restrictions on benefits for migrant workers and the rights of countries outside the eurozone are more contentious .", 
                "the prime minister 's initial proposal for a four-year ban on in-work benefits for eu migrants hit a wall of resistance from eastern european countries , who regarded it as discrimination against their nationals .",

                "but his document does not make clear whether the decision should be unanimous - in which case it could be blocked by a single eastern european state .", 
                "another potential obstacle is the plan to limit child benefit for migrant workers ' offspring living overseas .", 
                "cameron initially vowed to stop the payments , but secured only a proposal to pay them at the level of the child 's home country - which would in most cases be lower than uk parents receive .", 
                "payments are already being made for around 34,000 overseas children and cameron faces demands for the restriction only to apply to new claimants .",

                "but supporters of the single currency worry that it will be seen by countries like poland as an excuse to regard themselves as no longer bound by the obligation to work towards joining the euro - something from which only the uk and denmark are exempted by previously secured opt-outs .", 
                "the uk 's symbolic opt-out from ever-closer union is also a cause for concern on the continent , with belgium reportedly among the countries with reservations about the measure ."

                "the actor , emma thompson , called for britain to stay in the european union , saying the uk would be mad not to .", 
                "describing britain as a tiny little cloud-bolted , rainy corner of sort-of europe , a cake-filled misery-laden grey old island , thompson said she just felt european and would of course vote to remain in the eu in the upcoming referendum ."
