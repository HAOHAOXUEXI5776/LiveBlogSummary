                "the city of london is bracing for uk interest rates to rise before the end of 2017 , after the bank of england has dropped its loudest hint yet that borrowing costs will soon go up .", 
                "the financial markets are now pricing a roughly 50 % probability that rates will rise from their current record low , of 0.25 % , in november .", 
                "a rate hike is fully 'priced in ' by next february .", 
                "rate expectations nailing his credibility to the mast , boe governor mark carney has declared tonight that the possibility of a rate hike has definitely increased '' .", 
                "carney says : the majority of members of the ( monetary policy ) committee , myself included , see that that balancing act is beginning to shift , and that in order to return inflation to that 2 % target in a sustainable manner , there may need to be some adjustment of interest rates in the coming months .", 
                "now , we will take that decision based on the data .", 
                "i guess that possibility has definitely increased . ''", 
                "the comments came after the boe left interest rates unchanged , with just two of its nine policymakers voting for a hike .", 
                "but the minutes of the meeting stated that rates are likely to rise faster than the markets expect , and that a majority of mpc members expect to tighten policy 'in the coming months ' .", 
                "the comments sent the pound soaring by two cents to $ 1.34 , a one-year high .", 
                "the pound vs the dollar over the last year reuters it also wiped more than 1 % off top shares in london .", 
                "some city analysts have predicted that rates could rise in november , when the boe will also have new economic forecasts in its clutches .", 
                "for example , charles st-arnaud , senior investment strategist at lombard odier investment managers , says : if growth remains strong , which is likely based on the current business survey readings , and inflation continues to accelerate , we would not be surprised if the bank of england increased its policy rate before the end of 2017 .", 
                "therefore , we see further scope for market repricing in terms of timing , the release of the inflation report at the november meeting provides a good opportunity for the bank of england to act at that time , if current conditions continue to remain in place . ''", 
                "but others argue that the bank will maintain its reputation for talk , but not action .", 
                "sam hill of royal bank of canada suspects that , despite carney 's bold talk , the first rate hike in a decade might not come until 2018 as this is the last meeting before the mpc 's projections are updated for the november inflation report , we think that if the committee wanted to firmly signal a hike for that meeting , it would have chosen a different form of words than 'over the coming months ' .", 
                "in our view , the minutes do n't communicate whether or not november 2017 or february 2018 is more likely , just that a move at either of those meetings is more likely than it was back in august .", 
                "a more hawkish intent , but a long way from a pre-commitment to a november hike .", 
                "what 's unarguable , though , is that november 's mpc meeting will be extremely exciting here 's our full news story on the situation : uk interest rates stay steady at record low of 0.25 % read more and on that note , let 's wrap up for the night .",
