                "corbyn v smith - verdict : owen smith is articulate and combative , but it feels as if he has not really found a way of dismantling jeremy corbyn 's appeal and in tonight 's hustings that showed .", 
                "having adopted large chunks of the corbyn policy agenda , he has two main offers : competence/electability , and europe .", 
                "he was probably at his best in the early stages of the debate , talking about labour 's performance in the polls but it did not feel as if his arguments , robust as they were , were going to make much impression on those like the feel the love '' corbynista councillor .", 
                "( see 9.10am . )", 
                "on europe , smith has a distinctive position which should be attractive to labour 's pro-european membership .", 
                "and tonight he seemed to go further than he has in the past , making explicit something previously only implicit and saying that if he were leader labour could reject the eu referendum result and opt to keep the uk in the eu .", 
                "many pro-european politicians , like paddy ashdown and tony blair , would back this 100 % .", 
                "but it is a tricky argument to make now , because it is tantamount to saying ignore the referendum '' , and the studio audience reacted quite badly when he made his case .", 
                "smith should have had the edge over corbyn too on security , but the reminder of his isis gaffe set him back .", 
                "generally , though , corbyn seemed to exude confidence .", 
                "with the polls suggesting he is well ahead , this is not surprising , but what was striking was how much better a performer corbyn is now at this format than he was a year ago .", 
                "he was relaxed and even funny at times , and he managed to brush off smith 's most aggressive criticisms , over extremism .", 
                "it helped that the audience seemed more on his side than smith 's ( so much for bbc bias '' - see 8.57pm ) his claim that he would be able to take labour to power by inspiring the young may sound fanciful ( the psephologists say boosting youth turnout mostly helps labour get larger majorities in the seats they hold anyway ) , but it seemed to strike a chord with a large labour chunk of the studio audience .", 
                "what the public at large think is another matter , but this was a labour-dominated audience and they seem happy to keep him as leader ."
