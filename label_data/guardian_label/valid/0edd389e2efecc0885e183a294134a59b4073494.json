                "mr carney has probably been well aware from the outset that , since his salary and accommodation allowance are almost three times the remuneration of lord king of lothbury , his predecessor , it would be especially important to distance himself from the chancellor who had appointed him .",

                "his weekend statement that rates could rise , even if real incomes do not , keeps alive , at least notionally , the mpc 's option of raising interest rates before the general election , in february next year or even as early as november this year .", 
                "in short , mr carney has become a central bank head , committed to forward guidance , who would prefer to keep everyone guessing regarding future policy-actions .",

                "lewis concludes that the boe could ease the tension with a small rate rise soon , if it thinks the economy can bear it , saying : after all , a rate hike in the near future , even if not followed by another any time soon , would take the question of when the boe starts to tighten off the table .",
