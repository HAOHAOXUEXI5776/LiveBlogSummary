                "she should be so proud of herself for creating such a timeless masterpiece .", 
                "beautiful production , stunning vocals and devastatingly honest lyrics - martin yates i should point out from the outset that i am a huge adele fan .",

                "although we knew hello harped back to her ex , you 'd expect a triumphant positive \u0080\u0098look at me know ' type album given how she is in a happy , stable relationship with a gorgeous little boy .", 
                "therefore it was disappointing to hear an album which is pretty much dedicated once again to her ex which she ca n't get over .", 
                "i 'd be offended if i were her fella !", 
                "this retrospective angle does make you question whether she is just milking this whole \u0080\u0098nasty , heartbreaking ex ' story chamain lovett an album of reflection , self-evaluation and outlining priorities all the traits you 'd expect of a lady who 's outgrown the media-driven adolescence that run hands-in-hand with the music industry , and into her role as a mother , partner and role model .",

                "anything adele touches turns to gold , you can see this will have big commercial success , but whether it saves the music industry or cd sales is another question michael hope a truly flawless album , every song is sang with such conviction as always .", 
                "amazing country mixed with pop undertones throughout the album .", 
                "adele truly captures the theme of yearning to be younger , with less responsibility , than that which comes with becoming an adult sammy-lee morrow powerful and emotional to describe adele 's album would be a mere understatement !", 
                "as her chilling , dark mezzo-soprano voice and sad , romantic piano ballads filled my headphones i suddenly found myself in an indescribable deep state of stirred emotion , not all of which were pleasantly felt .", 
                "adele has this mesmerising way of getting her audience to not only re-live a bad break-up but perhaps re-live it in such a heart wrenching way that bring up new emotions and cause the overall experience to be felt ten times heavier than the actual break-up .", 
                "listening to 25 my particular favorite was when we were young .",
