                "this is a treasury which had to make huge changes to its forecast for the next two years just between november and march because it decided its november forecast was completely wrong .", 
                "this is a treasury which failed to forecast the huge damage membership of the exchange rate mechanism inflicted on us and they were always very keen to join and it gave us a huge recession .",

                "we will be better off out , we will be richer and more successful , but it 's not very easy to put precise numbers on it and we would n't attempt to put precise numbers on the economy for 2030 because who knows what 's going to happen .",

                "[ the government ] wish to make the argument that our partners in europe are going to damage our trade .",
