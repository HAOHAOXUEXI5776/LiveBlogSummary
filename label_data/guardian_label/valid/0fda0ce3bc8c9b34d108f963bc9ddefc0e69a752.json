                "alistair darling , the leader of better together , says new evidence has emerged today showing that the snp government is planning to cut \u00a3 450m from the health service .", 
                "he is referring to this story from the bbc and the herald , which is based on the leak of confidential papers presented to a meeting of scottish health board chief executives last month .", 
                "here 's an extract from the bbc story .", 
                "the papers were passed to the bbc and the herald by a senior nhs whistleblower , who said they had become frustrated by the argument of the yes campaign that the biggest threat to the nhs comes from the uk government .", 
                "the documents state : the status quo and preservation of existing models of care are no longer an option given the pressing challenges we face . ''", 
                "the papers outline a funding gap of \u00a3 400-\u00a3 450m in the next financial year , 2015/16 , which is described as a level significantly in excess of that previously required '' .", 
                "the documents suggest that health boards will have to consider centralising hospitals and closing services - a measure which the snp vowed to stop when it was elected in 2007 .", 
                "the story includes this quote from alex neil , the scottish health secretary .", 
                "despite scotland 's budget being slashed by 7.2 % by george osborne between 2010/11 and 2015/16 , our increases in health spending means that the nhs is receiving record high funding , with a budget increase of over \u00a3 1bn between 2010/11 and 2015/16 .", 
                "to ensure we can continue to develop the nhs , it 's important that nhs boards regularly discuss their future plans to inform budget discussions with scottish government officials , and to identify how we will continue to deliver quality care and treatment .", 
                "we continue to develop our health service to meet the changing demands of the people of scotland , and that 's why we 've already legislated to integrate health and social care from april next year .",
