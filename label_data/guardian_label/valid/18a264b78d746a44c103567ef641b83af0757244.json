                "the long-awaited report from dame louise casey into integration is out this morning and it makes awkward reading for politicians from all main parties .",

                "casey review raises alarm over social integration in the uk read more and here is how it starts .", 
                "governments have failed for more than a decade to ensure that social integration in the uk has kept up with the unprecedented pace and scale of immigration '' and have allowed some local communities to become increasingly divided , a major review has found .", 
                "at the end of a year-long study of community cohesion in britain , dame louise casey has branded ministerial attempts to boost integration of ethnic minorities as amounting to little more than saris , samosas and steel drums for the already well-intentioned '' .", 
                "accusing the government of serious failings in its approach to social cohesion , the government 's integration tsar said efforts had been squeezed since 2010 , with leaders falling well below the stated ambition to 'do more than any other government before us to promote integration ' '' .", 
                "the problem has not been a lack of knowledge but a failure of collective , consistent and persistent will to do something about it or give it the priority it deserves at both a national and local level , '' casey concluded , who said there had been failures in each administration .", 
                "sajid javid , the communities secretary , has responded on behalf of the government .", 
                "he said it was a valuable contribution '' - which often in these circumstances is a euphemism for unwelcome contribution '' .", 
                "javid went on : this government is building a democracy for everyone and our country has long been home to lots of different cultures and communities , but all of us have to be part of one society - british society .", 
                "so while it 's right that we celebrate the positive contribution that diverse groups make to british life , we also need to continue making sure that nobody is excluded from it or left behind .", 
                "i will be covering reaction to the report .", 
                "today , of course , we 've also got the start of the four-day supreme court hearing for the article 50 appeal .", 
                "we will be covering that on a separate blog , so coverage of it here will be minimal .", 
                "here is the agenda for the day .", 
                "11am : the supreme court hearing starts .",
