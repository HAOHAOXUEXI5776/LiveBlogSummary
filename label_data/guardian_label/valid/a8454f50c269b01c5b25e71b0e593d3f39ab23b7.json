                "this was really two speeches for the price of one .", 
                "the second half was all about mental health policy .", 
                "i posted a lengthy summary of the main points earlier ( see 10.42am ) , and i will post some reaction from mental health specialists later , but here i will just focus on the first half of the speech - the shared society '' stuff .", 
                "all prime ministers feel the need from time to time to define what they are about and , although this was not the first speech from theresa may setting out her political beliefs - the birmingham leadership speech , her downing street statement on becoming prime minister , her great meritocracy '' grammar schools speech and her conservative party conference speech , the good that government can do '' are the other four essential reads for anyone studying mayism - this was the first one that included a catchphrase intended to summarise her political philosophy .", 
                "the main problem with the speech is that the catchphrase , the shared society '' , is mystifying .", 
                "it is clearly intended to differentiate may from margaret thatcher ( there is no such thing as society '' - a phrase quite widely assumed to mean that thatcher did not believe in the individual 's responsibility to others , when in fact that is the opposite of what she was saying ) and from david cameron ( the big society '' - a phrase that alternatively meant volunteering , or decentralisation , or austerity , and disappeared without trace . )", 
                "but , having read the speech several times , i still have no real idea what the shared society '' is apart from , well , society - which by implication involves reciprocal links and obligations .", 
                "over the weekend someone was briefing that this was about society 's responsibilities being shared between the public and government .", 
                "but the term shared society '' does n't explain that .", 
                "as linguistic shorthand , it 's hopeless .", 
                "interestingly , may did not talk about the sharing society '' .", 
                "that would have been more comprehensible - but would have sounded like a commitment to higher taxes .", 
                "but just because may 's phrase does not explain her philosophy , that does not mean she does n't have one .", 
                "may certainly seems to believe more in the power of government than any of her predecessors as conservative leader since at least john major and that came out of the speech strongly .", 
                "it also included a relatively strong attack on the failure of her political predecessors to avert the populist revolt that fuelled brexit .", 
                "here is the full text of the speech .", 
                "and here are the main points .", 
                "may effectively accused her predecessors - tony blair , gordon brown and even david cameron - of contributing to brexit by tolerating the injustices created by globalisation .", 
                "we see these fringe voices gaining prominence in some countries across europe today - voices from the hard-left and the far-right stepping forward and sensing that this is their time .", 
                "but they stand on the shoulders of mainstream politicians who have allowed unfairness and division to grow by ignoring the legitimate concerns of ordinary people for too long .", 
                "politicians who embraced the twin pillars of liberalism and globalisation as the great forces for good that they are , but failed to understand that for too many people - particularly those on modest to low incomes living in rich countries like our own - these forces are something to be concerned , not thrilled , about .", 
                "politicians who supported and promoted an economic system that works well for a privileged few , but failed to ensure that the prosperity generated by free markets and free trade is shared by everyone , in every corner and community of their land .", 
                "she said that brexit gave britain a once-in-a-generation chance '' to decided what country it wants to be .", 
                "an opportunity because britain is going through a period of great national change , and as we do so we have a once-in-a-generation chance to step back and ask ourselves what kind of country we want to be .", 
                "she said that a belief in responsibility towards others was her core political belief .", 
                "the central tenet of my belief - the thing that shapes my approach - is that there is more to life than individualism and self-interest .", 
                "we form families , communities , towns , cities , counties and nations .", 
                "and we embrace the responsibilities those institutions imply .", 
                "she said that she believed in active government '' .", 
                "after explaining in her speech that she believed in responsibility towards others , she went on : and government has a clear role to play to support this conception of society .", 
                "it is to act to encourage and nurture those relationships , networks and institutions where it can .", 
                "and it is to step up to correct injustices and tackle unfairness at every turn - because injustice and unfairness are the things that drive us apart .", 
                "this means a government rooted not in the laissez-faire liberalism that leaves people to get by on their own , but rather in a new philosophy that means government stepping up because people who are just managing , just getting by do n't need a government that will get out of the way , they need a government that will make the system work for them .", 
                "an active government that will help them share in the growing prosperity of post-brexit britain .", 
                "this will be seen as marking a break with thatcherism , and potentially unpopular with some tories , although in practice the number of conservative mps who believe in a minimalist state is probably relatively small .", 
                "she said that she wanted government to focus not just on helping the very poor , but on those who are just managing '' .", 
                "because government and politicians have for years talked the language of social justice - where we help the very poorest - and social mobility - where we help the brightest among the poor .", 
                "but to deliver the change we need and build that shared society , we must move beyond this agenda and deliver real social reform across every layer of society so that those who feel that the system is stacked against them - those just above the threshold that attracts the government 's focus today yet who are by no means rich or well off - are also given the help they need .", 
                "so we will recalibrate how we approach policy development to ensure that everything we do as government helps to give those who are just getting by a fair chance - while still helping those who are most disadvantaged .", 
                "because people who are just managing , just getting by do n't need a government that will get out of the way , they need a government that will make the system work for them .", 
                "may said she did not want to stop helping the most disadvantaged '' , although it is hard to see how government can refocus resources on the moderately poor without having less available for the very poor .", 
                "she said that it was government 's role to bring the country together and this involved the shared society '' .", 
                "that 's why i believe that - when we consider both the obvious and the everyday injustices in unison - we see that the central challenge of our times is to overcome division and bring our country together by ensuring everyone has the chance to share in the wealth and opportunity on offer in britain today .", 
                "and that starts by building something that i call the shared society .", 
                "the shared society is one that does n't just value our individual rights but focuses rather more on the responsibilities we have to one another .", 
                "it 's a society that respects the bonds that we share as a union of people and nations .", 
                "the bonds of family , community , citizenship and strong institutions .", 
                "she said that she wanted government to tackle not just obvious injustices '' but everyday injustices '' .", 
                "she started the speech by repeating some striking figures about injustices facing blacks , white working-class boys , state schools pupils , women , mental health sufferers and the young .", 
                "( see 11.23am . )", 
                "at first this sounded odd , as if she had up the wrong script , but in retrospect it was a powerful moment , because some facts are so important they are worth repeating .", 
                "but then may made a distinction between these obvious injustices '' and what she called everyday injustices '' .", 
                "governments have traditionally been good at identifying - if not always addressing - such problems .", 
                "however , the mission i have laid out for the government - to make britain a country that works for everyone and not just the privileged few - goes further .", 
                "it means more than fighting these obvious injustices .", 
                "it means acknowledging and addressing the everyday injustices that too many people feel too .", 
                "because while the obvious injustices receive a lot of attention - with the language of social justice and social mobility a staple of most politicians today - the everyday injustices are too often overlooked .", 
                "but if you 're from an ordinary working class family , life is much harder than many people in westminster realise .", 
                "the injustice you feel may be less obvious , but it burns inside you just the same .", 
                "for you have a job but you do n't always have job security .", 
                "you have your own home , but you worry about paying the mortgage .", 
                "you can just about manage but you worry about the cost of living and getting your kids into a good school .", 
                "she defended her decision to criticise so-called citizens of the world '' in her conservative party conference speech .", 
                "mark carney , the canadian governor of the bank of england , was one of those reportedly upset by the speech .", 
                "today she said : a few months ago at the conservative party conference in birmingham , i upset some by saying that 'if you think you 're a citizen of the world , you 're a citizen of nowhere ' .", 
                "but my point was simple .", 
                "it was that the very word 'citizen ' implies that we have responsibilities to the people around us .", 
                "the people in our community , on our streets , in our places of work .", 
                "and too often today , those responsibilities have been forgotten as the cult of individualism has taken hold , and globalisation and the democratisation of communications has encouraged people to look beyond their own communities and immediate networks in the name of joining a broader global community .", 
                "she did not address the point that people who identify with a wider community might also feel responsibilities to that community too .", 
                "global warming and international aid are too good examples .",

                "yesterday , in her interview on sky 's sophy ridge on sunday , theresa may said that the government had given the nhs the money it needs .", 
                "she told the programme : we asked the nhs a while back to set out what it needed over the next five years in terms of its plan for the future and the funding that it would need .", 
                "they did that , we gave them that funding , in fact we gave them more funding than they required so funding is now at record levels for the nhs , more money has been going in .",

                "in an article published today on the brexitcentral website michael gove , the former justice secretary and leading vote leave campaigner , says the nhs needs more funding '' .", 
                "government squanders billions on vanity projects every year while our tried and trusted nhs needs more funding .", 
                "in his article he claims that leaving the eu would allow more money to be spent on the nhs ( although , strangely , he does not repeat vote leave 's much-discredited claim that brexit would release \u00a3 350m a week for the nhs . )", 
                "but the article is not mostly about the nhs .", 
                "gove 's main point is to attack those saying the uk should remain in the single market or the customs union , saying that would amount to a fake brexit '' .", 
                "he even suggests he is opposed to a transitional arrangement for when the uk leaves .", 
                "those supporters of the eu who still have n't come to terms with the referendum result want to delay and drag out the process of leaving .", 
                "they often change their demands - sometimes they insist we should stay in the single market , on other occasions they stress the importance of the customs union , at yet other points they talk about transition arrangements or ten-year-long trade talks - but they have one simple goal : they want to complicate and obfuscate the process in the hope that the public appetite for change will dissipate so they can secure a relationship with the eu which is as close as possible to the status quo .",
