                "the official forecasts appear consistent with our view that the vote to leave the european union in the referendum on 23 june will have a negative impact on the uk economy and public finances , as lower growth translates to lower expected tax receipts and higher spending on transfers .",

                "the agency also welcomes hammond 's decision to ditch the budget surplus target this parliament , and only try to get the deficit down to 2 % of gdp .",
