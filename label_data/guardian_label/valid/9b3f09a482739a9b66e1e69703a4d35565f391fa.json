                "donald tusk , president of the european council , has said that getting a brexit withdrawal deal agreed by the autumn of next year will be a furious race against time .", 
                "( see 4.38pm . )", 
                "michel barnier , the eu 's chief brexit negotiator , has said that david davis , the brexit secretary , was wrong to say a uk-eu trade deal could be signed just after brexit .", 
                "( see 5.08pm . )", 
                "david davis has scrambled to salvage relations with brussels after he was accused of damaging trust in the brexit talks by making inflammatory comments over the status of britain 's promises .", 
                "as daniel boffey reports , the brexit secretary engaged in urgent telephone diplomacy on tuesday in an attempt to persuade guy verhofstadt , the european parliament 's brexit coordinator , that the uk government 's word could be depended upon .", 
                "brussels has been deeply irritated by davis 's claim over the weekend that the uk 's concessions in an agreement struck last week with the eu to move talks on were merely a statement of intent without legal backing .", 
                "anna soubry , a leading pro-european tory , has urged ministers to reach out to the remainers and compromise ahead of a vote on the eu withdrawal bill tomorrow where the government faces possible defeat .", 
                "ministers could lose because some tories like soubry are planning to back an amendment tabled by dominic grieve , the conservative former attorney general , intended to give mps a truly meaningful vote on the final brexit deal .", 
                "speaking in this afternoon 's debate , soubry said : what i would urge all members of her majesty 's government , especially those in the most important of positions , is please now reach out to the remainers - often called now former remainers , the 48 % .", 
                "do n't tar us with the same paintbrush that you yourself may have used for many , many years , and try and build a consensus .", 
                "and that means the government has got to give a little bit more than it so far has given .", 
                "speaking on the world at one , grieve said that he had enough votes to defeat the government ( opposition mps are expected to support him ) and that he would push his amendment to a vote tomorrow if the government did not compromise .", 
                "he said : i do n't see any possibility of my backing down on this at all .", 
                "i will vote for my amendment .", 
                "i do n't know whether i will be successful or not but i think i must push it forward .", 
                "i do n't want to defeat the government .", 
                "it is not my desire to do this , i would much prefer the government to listen to what we have been saying , accept the amendment , and , at a later stage , the government can always correct it if it wants to .", 
                "in a hint that the government may back down , the prime minister 's spokesman told journalists : the government position has been throughout that we are listening to mps and we are having conversations with them , and where we think the legislation can be improved , we are prepared to take it on board .", 
                "i think what the mps are asking for is clarity .", 
                "we are looking at the amendment and will respond to it in due course .", 
                "there will be several votes when the debate ends tonight at around 9.10pm , but the most awkward vote for the government is scheduled for tomorrow .", 
                "the boss of the us civil aviation regulator has urged the uk to reveal by next month whether it will remain in a key safety body after brexit .", 
                "as the press association reports , michael huerta of the federal aviation administration ( faa ) flew from washington to london on tuesday for talks with transport secretary chris grayling before meetings with european union officials in brussels on wednesday .", 
                "he told reporters he wants to bring a level of urgency to the uk 's deliberations over what safety standards it will meet for the manufacture of aviation products and aircraft maintenance .", 
                "the competency of uk firms is currently accepted by the faa because the uk is a member of the eu 's european aviation safety agency ( easa ) , which has a bilateral agreement with the us .", 
                "huerta said this status essentially evaporates with brexit in march 2019 and the uk must decide whether to adopt the framework of easa or create its own standards .", 
                "the registration of 3 million eu nationals for settled status in britain will involve an online application form with six to eight questions , a cost of no more than \u00e2\u00a3 72 , and a decision delivered within two weeks , the immigration minister , brandon lewis , has said .",
