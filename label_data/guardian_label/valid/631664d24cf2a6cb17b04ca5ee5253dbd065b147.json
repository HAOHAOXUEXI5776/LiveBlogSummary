                "osborne insisted that , overall , most people would be better off as a result of government measures despite the cuts to tax credits .", 
                "it was important to take into account the impact of increasing the minimum wage , raising the tax allowance and providing free childcare , he said .", 
                "the truth is the minimum wage has just gone up this week to \u00a3 6.70 , the national living wage is coming in next april at the same time as the changes to tax credits at \u00a3 7.20 , income taxes have already been cut by me by up to \u00a3 1,000 .", 
                "we have made a set of changes that , if you take them in the round , mean families are better off and at the same time we have a country that has economic security , where more and more of its budget is not going to welfare .", 
                "he also claimed that current welfare spending was unsustainable because britain had 1 % of the world 's population , 4 % of its economy , but 7 % of its welfare spending .", 
                "unless we take steps to curb the cost of this welfare we are basically confining this country to the second row , to the back row of history .", 
                "i do n't want that to be the case for britain .", 
                "he suggested that building a second runway at gatwick was still seriously being considered by the government as an option .", 
                "in a report published before the summer the davies commission said britain needed a new runway in the south of england and that it should be built at heathrow .", 
                "it accepted that gatwick was an option , but it said it would not be as good .", 
                "osborne suggested the government could ignore davies and go for gatwick .", 
                "he said : we now have an independent report that has forced the choice on government , made it very clear what the options are , ruled out all sorts of other options that are out there , and said here , if you want to build a runway - and , by the way , you need to - you can either put on at heathrow or you can put one at gatwick .", 
                "and now you decide now , of course , the government has got to make that decision .", 
                "he said the decision would be taken by christmas .", 
                "it was important for the government to follow proper procedure , he said , otherwise there could be a judicial review , holding the project up for years .", 
                "he said britain was pretty rubbish '' at taking infrastructure decisions .", 
                "that was why he was setting up the national infrastructure commission .", 
                "britain is pretty rubbish at making big decisions on infrastructure .", 
                "it takes decades to get agreement on things like crossrail i want to change all that .", 
                "it was important to press ahead with big infrastructure projects , he said : but in the end i ask you the question : if we had never built the m25 , or the m6 or the channel tunnel or the west coast mainline , where would we be as a country ?", 
                "all of those projects were bitterly contested at the time .", 
                "it is a lesson for us as a country that the future favours the bold .", 
                "he said david cameron would be meeting angela merkel , the german chancellor , later this week to discuss the eu renegotiation .", 
                "he suggested that the protesters who spat at journalists during the anti-austerity demonstration yesterday were associated with the trade unions .", 
                "asked about their conduct , he replied : those protesters are , essentially , part of a big trade union march .", 
                "the trade unions support the labour party , pay the labour party .", 
                "they 've just bought the leadership of the labour party .", 
                "so it 's not really surprising they do n't like the conservative party .", 
                "he rejected the suggestion that the creation of the national infrastructure commission meant he was declaring war on the shires .", 
                "i do n't want to declare war on people .", 
                "i want to shake the inertia across this country against building things , against building homes , against building roads , against building railways .", 
                "he said that the tories had a particular responsibility '' now to represent working people because labour under jeremy corbyn was heading off to the fringes '' .", 
                "he has made a decision - a decision fully supported by a labour party that voted for him - to head off to the fringes .",
