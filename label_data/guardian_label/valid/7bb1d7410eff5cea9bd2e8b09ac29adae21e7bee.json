                "i can hold my referendum at any time up until the end of 2017 .", 
                "and it 's much more important to get this right than to rush it .", 
                "does cameron really mean this ?", 
                "in truth cameron is in a hurry .",

                "but cameron could perhaps stretch the process out a little bit beyond friday 19 february ( the final day of the eu summit scheduled for next month ) .", 
                "there has been speculation that a second summit could be held later that month to finalise the deal .", 
                "cameron seems to be floating the idea of a delay in the hope of marginally increasing pressure on his eu counterparts to compromise .",

                "even if i 'm successful in getting this reform package and holding this referendum , and britain decides to stay in a reformed europe , at no stage will you hear me say 'that is perfection , this organisation is now fixed ' .", 
                "there are many things that are imperfect about the european union today and there will be many things that will be imperfect about the european union even after this negotiation the reform will not be finished .",

                "i would say do n't hold back right now , even though the question is n't settled .", 
                "i think that if business backs my reforms , if you want to see the competitive europe , if you want to see the flexible europe , if you want to see a europe where you can be in the eurozone and win or out of the eurozone and win , i would argue get out there and support those things .", 
                "i think it is important that with this , which is such a massively important generational question for britain and for europe , the sooner you can start to look at your own businesses and come up with examples and ideas about the benefits , and the problems , that there are with europe , the more that you are able to help to explain and set the context for this vitally important question .",
