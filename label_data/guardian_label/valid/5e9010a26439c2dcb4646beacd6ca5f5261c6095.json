                "here are the main points from philip hammond 's mansion house speech .", 
                "hammond , the chancellor , said the uk should abide by eu customs union rules for a period after brexit .", 
                "( see 9.08am ) this would almost certainly lead to a delay in the uk being able to implement new trade deals with other countries , because the eu would not let the uk set its own tariffs while it was still effectively in the customs union .", 
                "he insisted the government would manage migration not seek to shut it down ' after brexit .", 
                "just as the british people understand the benefits of trade so , too , they understand how important it is to business to be able to access global talent and to move individuals around their organisations .", 
                "so , while we seek to manage migration , we do not seek to shut it down .", 
                "he confirmed that he wanted brexit to involve a transitional phase , to avoid unnecessary disruption and dangerous cliff edges .", 
                "he claimed that some europeans were already using brexit to seek to impose protectionist restrictions on the city .", 
                "let 's be honest , we are already hearing protectionist agendas being advanced , disguised as arguments about regulatory competence , financial stability , and supervisory oversight .", 
                "we can have no truck with that approach .", 
                "but we acknowledge that , as britain leaves the eu , there are genuine and reasonable concerns among our eu colleagues about oversight of financial markets that will then be outside eu jurisdiction , but which provide a vast proportion of economically vital financial services to eu firms and citizens .", 
                "he said europe needed to avoid the fragmentation of financial services and he said brexit would have to involve evidence-based , symmetrical and transparent rules for the regulation of financial services .", 
                "he said he wanted a brexit that puts jobs and prosperity first .", 
                "( this is similar to labour 's slogan ; it wants a jobs-first brexit . )", 
                "he said he was taking measures to expand the supply of capital funding in the uk , to compensate for the impact of the uk no longer getting european investment bank infrastructure investment after brexit .", 
                "he said that he would broaden the range of the uk guarantee scheme so that it offers construction guarantees for the first time , that the british business bank would increase the amount it invests in venture capital funds and that he would bring forward some of the investment in the autumn statement .", 
                "he acknowledged that the public were weary of austerity .", 
                "and he said that he had already relaxed the government 's anti-austerity drive , setting a longer timescale for getting the budget into surplus when he took over as chancellor last year .", 
                "but he played down the prospect of further measures to undo austerity , saying that he was opposed to higher taxes or higher borrowing .", 
                "funding for public services can only be delivered in one of three ways : higher taxes ; higher borrowing ; or stronger economic growth .", 
                "and only one of those three choices is a long-term sustainable solution for this country in the face of the inexorable pressure of an ageing population .", 
                "higher taxes will slow growth , undermine competitiveness , and cost jobs\u0080\u00a6 \u0080\u00a6so the government will remain committed to keeping taxes as low as possible ; and higher discretionary borrowing to fund current consumption is simply asking the next generation to pay for something that we want to consume , but are not prepared to pay for ourselves\u0080\u00a6 \u0080\u00a6so we will remain committed to the fiscal rules set out at the autumn statement which will guide us , via interim targets in 2020 , to a balanced budget by the middle of the next decade .", 
                "stronger growth is the only sustainable way to deliver better public services , higher real wages and increased living standards .", 
                "he acknowledged that globalisation was unpopular and said the government would push for a new version , with a greater focus on services .", 
                "this was gloablisation 2.0 , he implied , although he did not use that phrase .", 
                "britain has benefited from globalisation .", 
                "but we must not turn a blind eye to the growing tide of hostility to it in parts of the developed world .", 
                "to counter that , we must push for a new phase of globalisation , to ensure that it delivers clear benefits for ordinary working people in developed economies .", 
                "to date , much of the thrust of globalisation has focused on the removal of barriers to trade in goods .", 
                "globalisation 1.0 if you like - expanding the opportunities for major goods exporters like china and germany to sell their products to a larger market .", 
                "but our economy is 80 % services .", 
                "and many of our areas of greatest competitiveness are in services : for example , finance and insurance , ict and communications .", 
                "so , for the uk to be able to share fairly in the benefits of globalisation , we need to lead a global crusade for liberalisation of services .", 
                "he said the government must , and will , also get to the bottom of the failure at grenfell [ tower ] and take decisive action to ensure nothing like this ever happens again .",
