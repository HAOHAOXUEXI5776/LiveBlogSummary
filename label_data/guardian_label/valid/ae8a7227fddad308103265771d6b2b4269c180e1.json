                "white nationalist and onetime candidate for us senate david duke has hailed donald trump 's accession to the republican presidential nomination as an amazing victory , calling trump 's rise a chance for white supremacists to expose the jewish supremacists who control our country .", 
                "the trump campaign at a whole series of levels is a great opportunity for us to expose the people who really run the republican party , who run the democratic party , who run the political establishment and who are leading us all to disaster , said duke , a former grand wizard of the ku klux klan , of the jewish extremists who he accused of controlling american government on his radio show .", 
                "first reported by rightwingwatch , duke exhorted listeners to make sure that trump understands that we expect him to follow through on these things and we expect him to be our white knight , our advocate and our person .", 
                "duke 's endorsement of trump in february - and his subsequent declaration that the billionaire 's candidacy might rehabilitate the public image of adolf hitler - has highlighted trump 's appeal among the so-called alt-right , an amorphous political movement whose proponents frequently espouse radical racialist views .", 
                "trump initially declined to condemn duke after his endorsement , telling cnn that i do n't know anything about david duke ; certainly i would disavow it if i thought there was something wrong .", 
                "trump subsequently reversed course , tweeting a video in which he told press : as i stated at the press conference on friday regarding david duke i disavow .", 
                "trump also did not condemn the ku klux klan , as he was asked to during the interview .", 
                "in an interview with cnn 's wolf blitzer yesterday , trump also declined to send a message to supporters who had sent a torrent of antisemitic and threatening messages to journalist julia ioffe this week after her profile of donald trump 's wife , melania , appeared in this month 's issue of gq .", 
                "i do n't have a message to the fans i 'm not gon na talk about that , the presumptive nominee said .", 
                "all of this has only emboldened trump 's white supremacist acolytes , duke said in his radio show , before pushing his listeners to normalize trump 's more extreme positions on immigration and national security .", 
                "this is a movement to take america back , and when we say \u0080\u0098take america back , ' we know exactly what that means , duke said , and i think everybody who says that knows what it means .", 
                "and if we do n't keep putting that heat , if we do n't keep pushing the envelope over , we 've got to be so far to the right for our people that trump seems moderate so that he will have space to move to the right himself because we 've got to start an evolutionary movement to the right ."
