                "the key benefits of the norway option '' compared to scotland being taken completely out of the eu and single market , is that it would allow scotland to continue to trade in both goods and services within a european single market of 500m people , free of most tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade , while retaining our trading relationship with the rest of the uk it would not just be scotland that would potentially benefit from such a solution .",
