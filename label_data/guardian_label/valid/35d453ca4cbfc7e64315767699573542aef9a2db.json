                "when the bbc 's laura kuenssberg asked a few minutes ago why may did not debate corbyn , given the importance of public scrutiny , may replied : yes , public scrutiny is for an election campaign .",

                "analysis may might have been better advise to stick to just one explanation for not debating corbyn instead of giving four .", 
                "she managed to come up with multiple reasons without mentioning the obvious and most credible one : that it is generally sensible for serving prime ministers who are ahead in the polls to avoid debates because they have nothing to gain and everything to lose .", 
                "in adopting this approach , may is just following the policy adopted by every prime minister from the 1950s , when tv started covering elections , until gordon brown in 2010 .", 
                "it is not not a particularly brave or principled stance , but tactically it makes sense .", 
                "however , it has become more difficult for may to refuse to participate in debates than it was for prime ministers like margaret thatcher and tony blair because both her two immediate predecessors , brown and david cameron , did do them .",

                "publishing a dossier showing what would happen to key public service indicators on the basis of current trends , he said : the future of the nhs and our schools are at stake in this election .",

                "we will cut class sizes , take a million people off the nhs waiting list and ensure people get the care they deserve .", 
                "by contrast another five years of the tories would be disastrous for our public services .", 
                "at the rate we 're going we could see 5.5 million people on the english waiting list and 1.5 million older people with unmet care needs .", 
                "and young people and their families face the prospect of more overcrowding in schools and having to up the bill for the tories ' unfair plan to scrap free school meals for hundreds of thousands of children .", 
                "he claimed a leaked labour policy document suggesting the party would allow unskilled immigration from the eu did not represent party policy .", 
                "asked about it , he said : what you 've been reading is a document that was being discussed between researchers in our teams , as happens every day of the week in every party and all around parliament .", 
                "our policy is in our manifesto .", 
                "that is the policy that we will be carrying out .", 
                "corbyn said labour would manage migration .", 
                "he also accused theresa may of making false promises on immigration , because the tories have failed to get annual net migration below 100,000 despite having promised to do so in their 2010 and 2015 manifestos .", 
                "he firmed up his opposition to a second scottish independence referendum while the brexit talks are still going on .", 
                "going further than what he said yesterday ( see 10.32am ) , he said it would be extremely wrong and unwise to have a referendum before the brexit process was over .",

                "what is needed now is a serious debate about the problems of under-funding of public services in scotland and i think it would be extremely wrong and unwise to go into a referendum while the brexit negotiations are going on .",
