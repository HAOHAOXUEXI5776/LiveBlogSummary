                "in an article in the mail on sunday this morning , lord carlile , the lib dem peer and the uk government 's former independent reviewer of terror legislation , said the government 's internet surveillance bill should be rush through parliament following the paris attacks .",

                "but diane abbott , the labour mp and shadow international development secretary , told the same programme it would be a mistake to rush the bill through parliament .",

                "and , significantly , that is what the home office is saying too .", 
                "a source at the department say that ministers were not minded to try to rush the bill onto the statute book .", 
                "he said : we are committed to the pre-legislative scrutiny process that the home secretary has set out [ which involves a joint committee of mps and peers looking at the draft bill before a final version is agreed ] and we can not pre-judge what the committee will make of the bill .", 
                "we have a timetable , and i do n't think we will be rolling back from that .", 
                "with something so important , i can not see us suddenly setting that aside and rushing the bill through parliament .", 
                "update : the home office has now issued a statement confirming that it is rejecting carlile 's call to rush the investigatory powers bill through parliament .", 
                "this is from a home office spokesman : the draft investigatory powers bill was published on 4 november .", 
                "it will be scrutinised by a joint committee of both houses of parliament , and the government will introduce its final proposals to parliament in the spring with a view to the bill becoming law before the end of 2016 ."
