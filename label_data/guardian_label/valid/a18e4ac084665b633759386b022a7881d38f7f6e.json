            "text": [
                "this afternoon we 've launched a piece which i 'd describe at the sum of three years and several weeks intensive work .", 
                "it 's an essay from me on labor and bill shorten .", 
                "i wanted to cover several things : his incredible good luck , his approach to leadership ( recessed ) , labor 's policy shift during this term in opposition , his networks and power relationships .", 
                "but the more i got into the piece the more i realised this was actually an essay about political leadership .", 
                "shorten in this term in office has stepped outside the messiah mode of australian political leadership .", 
                "he 's consistently prioritised party unity over decisiveness .", 
                "he has attempted to stitch a fractured party back together , and his approach has been , genuinely , unexpected .", 
                "on the way up shorten was an assiduous self-mythologiser , presenting himself as the next big thing .", 
                "but as leader it 's been all about the group .", 
                "and here 's where i take up the story in the essay .", 
                "a couple of biggish questions follow .", 
                "but viewed in another way , his recessed character is disconcerting .", 
                "shorten 's leadership style , for me , points to an essential puzzle about the man .", 
                "does bill shorten lead in the way he does because he genuinely believes that 's the durable model ; that consensus is the only way to save politics from its worst excesses of ego and intrigue ?", 
                "or is enlightened fusion , or leadership by serial conciliation , or whatever you want to call it , a convenient way to lead when the leader does n't actually stand for anything ?", 
                "some labor colleagues do wonder whether policies the party will take to the coming election have come together because of shorten , in the sense of reflecting his core values , or in a strange way , in spite of him , emerging almost by default from colleagues pitching ideas into a vacuum , with shorten sitting like a blank canvas at the top of the table , calculating and calibrating wins and losses among colleagues , maintaining a mental spread sheet to make sure everyone gets a little bit of something .", 
                "because he keeps it low key and collaborative , colleagues point to a tendency where shorten seems to agree with everyone , which can be disconcerting when ideas are contested : where will he land , what does he really think ?", 
                "leadership like that is highly pragmatic but it can be porous and directionless as well , and there has been an intermittent sense over this past term of shorten minimising himself to the point of fading from view , a kind of vanishing in plain sight .", 
                "but the success of his model does pose a question that resonates well beyond him and his fate on 2 july .", 
                "it 's a question for all of us who have a stake in politics and who have weathered the storms of the past several years with an increasing sense of agitation .", 
                "is this go as group approach to political leadership what actually needs to happen to end the destructive turbulence that has infected australia 's political system ?", 
                "do we all need to make our peace with it , because if we do n't , if we cling stubbornly to our own puffed up mythologies about leadership and project them onto our politicians , are we in danger of missing the real insight : that politics is n't about omniscience and cult of personality and the genius of great men of history , it 's about institutions .", 
                "institutional leadership is actually durable leadership .", 
                "in our lust for great stories of great leadership over the past 20 years of australian political history , have we missed the real story ?", 
                "is the real story leaders who are in symmetry with their own institutions are the people who will be permitted to remain first among equals at the cabinet table long enough to prevail \u00e2\u00ad and leave a legacy ?", 
                "it 's a big chunky piece .",
