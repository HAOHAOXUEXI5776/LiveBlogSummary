                "he warned on sunday , as the election results came in , that erdogan should remain within his constitutional limits or consider resigning .", 
                "he also said turkey should hold a new election if the akp is unable to agree a coalition with parliament 's two other opposition parties .",

                "however , there is no constitutional requirement for this , and it is far from certain that erdogan , who has built a political career on opposition to the chp , would go this route .", 
                "the chp won around 132 seats , according to initial results .", 
                "it could team up in a coalition with the mhp and the pro-kurdish people 's democratic party ( hdp ) , which made it across the 10 % threshold and entered parliament for the first time in sunday 's vote .", 
                "while it is unlikely that the mhp and hdp could set aside stark differences , deputy prime minister bulent arinc challenged the three opposition parties to try to form a coalition , saying the akp was ready to step into the void if they failed .",
