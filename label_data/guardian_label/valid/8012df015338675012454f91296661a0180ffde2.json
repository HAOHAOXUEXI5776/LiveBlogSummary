                "julian borger outlines five things we learned from the dsb 's preliminary report : 1 .", 
                "the pilots were not told to fly lower as the plane approached eastern ukraine at 12.53 , responsibility for its flight path passed to air traffic control at dnipropetrovsk .", 
                "the controllers asked the pilots to climb from 33,000ft to 35,000ft to keep away from other airliners in the area but the crew replied they were unable to comply and requested to maintain at [ 33,000ft ] '' .", 
                "as a result , other air traffic was asked to climb to 35,000ft .", 
                "the reason for mh17 not being able to climb is not spelled out , but it could be because of weather .", 
                "there were some thunderstorms in the area .", 
                "in fact , at 13.00 , according to the report , the flight turned slightly to the left due to weather '' , 20 minutes before it was brought down .", 
                "this contradicts at least one of the conspiracy theories in circulation that the plane was told to fly lower than planned by ukrainian air traffic control .", 
                "2 .", 
                "mh17 made no distress signals the flight data recorder and digital cockpit voice recorder both stopped at 20 seconds past 13.20 .", 
                "no alerts or alarms can be heard or any sign of distress .", 
                "the last voice communication from the cockpit came 24 seconds earlier - an acknowledgement of the latest routine course instructions from air traffic control .", 
                "unavailable to raise mh17 , dnipropetrovsk asked the next air traffic control centre along the route , at rostov , if they could see the plane on their screens .", 
                "they replied : no , it seems that its target started falling apart . ''",

                "'high-energy objects ' brought the flight down the fuselage was pierced from the outside by large numbers of high-energy objects '' .", 
                "the cockpit seems to have been particularly badly hit , above the level of the cockpit floor .", 
                "the dsb investigators have not been able to recover or study any of the objects that penetrated the plane .", 
                "the report does not speculate on the origin or nature of the objects , but the findings would be consisted with a fragmentation warhead , like the one carried by the buk anti-aircraft missile , mostly widely thought to have been involved in the shooting down of the plane .", 
                "4 .", 
                "the front fell to ground first the plane broke apart in the air with the front parts breaking off first and falling to the ground .", 
                "the result was that parts of the rear and centre of the plane , which kept moving forward , were found further east than the front .", 
                "5 .", 
                "mh17 was flying above the minimum altitude air traffic restrictions had been in force over eastern ukraine since 1 july , because of the conflict .",

                "the question raised by the tragedy , but not explicitly framed in this report , is whether all civilian aircraft should have been banned at all altitudes , given the presence of such fearsome weapons were in the area .",
