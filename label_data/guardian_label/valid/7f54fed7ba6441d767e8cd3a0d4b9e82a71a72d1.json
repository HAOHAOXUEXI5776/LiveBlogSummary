                "share prices have bounced , the pound has stabilised and even edged up a bit on the foreign exchanges , and long-term interest rates have fallen .", 
                "thirdly , the economy has received something of a stimulus from the fall in the pound which boosts exports and from the bank 's decision to ease the capital requirements on commercial banks , which increases their capacity to lend .", 
                "fourthly , it is hard to see what material effect a cut in interest rates to 0.25 % will have , given that they are already at record low levels .",
