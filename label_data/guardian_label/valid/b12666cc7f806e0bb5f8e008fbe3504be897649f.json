                "that could includes showering the economy with \u0080\u0098helicopter money ' , if government spending cuts have created a low-inflation , low-growth quagmire .", 
                "ed balls , james howat and anna stansbury argue that central banks are struggling to get inflation up to target because governments are n't spending enough .", 
                "they say : many economists have argued that recent austerity has not improved fiscal positions much , and may even have worsened them .", 
                "rather , there is reason to believe that fiscal policy is structurally prone to undermine monetary policy at the zero lower bound .", 
                "indeed , many governments also responded with austerity in the depression , the last time that western economies fell into a liquidity trap .", 
                "explanations for the popularity of austerity at the zero lower bound include that recessions are opportunities for those calling for a smaller state to trim public expenditure .", 
                "they can blame the recession on lax fiscal policy during the boom years .", 
                "households , particularly those with the median voters , are sympathetic to the argument that the government must tighten its belt at the same time as they do .", 
                "so if austerity drags an economy into a liquidity trap , policymakers may be forced to consider unconventional methods , such as helicopter money - under which a central bank creates new money to fund an expansionary fiscal policy .", 
                "this is a controversial issue in economics - and this paper explains how this could happen : the first principle is that the central bank should shape the broad outlines of the coordination .", 
                "not only does the central bank have macro-economic expertise which is vital if the coordination is to work , its leadership of the process is crucial to avoiding fiscal dominance .", 
                "the central bank should be in charge of both initiating and ending the monetary-fiscal coordination process .", 
                "to minimise political pressures on the central bank , the coordination process also needs to be clearly defined at the outset .", 
                "in the event of helicopter drops , for example , the central bank needs to outline triggers for stopping them , such as an inflation knockout .", 
                "this will protect the operational independence of core monetary policy , thereby anchoring inflation expectations .", 
                "the second principle is that any coordination mechanism must maintain political control over fiscal policy .", 
                "so although the central bank can propose the outlines of a coordination plan , the government can refuse to participate .", 
                "what 's more , the coordinating mechanism must distinguish between the stance and the content of fiscal policy .", 
                "so while the central bank might call for looser fiscal policy , it should not comment on the composition of this loosening .", 
                "admittedly , the content of fiscal policy affects its macro-economic impact .", 
                "nonetheless , given the political dangers of commenting on individual fiscal items , and the democratic argument for the government to retain discretion over different tax and spending components , any coordination mechanism should limit itself to the fiscal stance .", 
                "the third principle is that monetary-fiscal coordination should be strictly limited to the zero lower bound .", 
                "even if a coordination mechanism effectively protects central bank independence and preserves democratic control over fiscal policy , entering the realm of fiscal policy still presents considerable threats to central bank independence .", 
                "the prospect of central bankers routinely commenting on fiscal policy may undermine political support for central bank independence or may open up the central bank to reciprocal criticism over monetary policy from the government .", 
                "by limiting such coordination to only when it is most effective , these risks can be minimised .",
