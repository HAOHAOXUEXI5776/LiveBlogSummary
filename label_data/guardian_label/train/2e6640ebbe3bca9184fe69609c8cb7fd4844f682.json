            "text": [
                "here are the main points from theresa may 's speech .", 
                "it was bold on analysis , but very thin on prescription .", 
                "may said free market economics were currently not delivering for ordinary working people '' .", 
                "and those of us who believe that the interests of the british people are best served through a successful open , free market economy need to be honest about where it is not currently working or delivering for ordinary working people today .", 
                "this was probably the most interesting claim in the speech .", 
                "but after making this point , she followed it with a long passage defending existing government policy in areas like banking , industrial policy , financial services , labour market reform and education .", 
                "she mentioned the taylor review ( without saying which of its recommendations she would accept ) , and said too many young people do n't have the right skills , but she did not mention housing or low wages , and overall she did not really explain how the system might be changed to address the problem she identified .", 
                "she said that the free market economy was the greatest agent of collective human progress ever created '' .", 
                "she explained : when countries make the transition from closed , restricted , centrally-planned economies to open , free market policies , the same things happen .", 
                "life expectancy increases , and infant mortality falls .", 
                "absolute poverty shrinks , and disposable income grows .", 
                "access to education is widened , and rates of illiteracy plummet .", 
                "participation in cultural life is extended , and more people have the chance to contribute .", 
                "it is in open , free market economies that technological breakthroughs are made which transform , improve and save lives .", 
                "it is in open , free market economies that personal freedoms and liberties find their surest protection .", 
                "a free market economy , operating under the right rules and regulations , is the greatest agent of collective human progress ever created .", 
                "it was the new combination which led societies out of darkness and stagnation and into the light of the modern age .", 
                "she explained what she saw as the foundations of a free market economy .", 
                "in essence , it is very simple .", 
                "it consists of an open market place , in which everyone is free to participate regulated under the rule of law with personal freedoms , equality and human rights democratically guaranteed and an accountable government , progressively taxing the economic activity which the market generates to fund high-quality public services which are freely available to all citizens , according to need .", 
                "that is unquestionably the best , and indeed the only sustainable , means of increasing the living standards of everyone in a country .", 
                "she said those arguing for free market economics to be abandoned were wrong .", 
                "now , some argue that a free market economy is an end in itself , and that drawing attention to the downsides is somehow anti-business .", 
                "others would use the imbalances which are now apparent as a justification for the total rejection of the free market economy , which has done so much to improve our lives .", 
                "instead they advocate ideologically extreme policies which have long-ago been shown to fail , and which are failing people today in places like venezuela .", 
                "my argument has always been that if you want to preserve and improve a system which has delivered unparalleled benefits , you have to take seriously its faults and do all you can to address them .", 
                "not to do so would put everything we have achieved together as a country at risk .", 
                "it would lead to a wider loss of faith in free markets , and risk a return to the failed ideologies of the past .", 
                "a return to protectionism in international trade , and to inflationary policies at home .", 
                "far from somehow protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society , that outcome would surely hurt them the most .", 
                "although may did not mention labour or jeremy corbyn , she was clearly referring to them here .", 
                "but her claims were very generalised , and ignored the point that corbyn is not calling for the entire abandonment of market economics ( although he would not defend it in the terms may does ) .", 
                "he is attacking what he describes as its neoliberal incarnation - deregulation , privatisation , and cuts to government spending .", 
                "may said little to address the case corbyn has been making on these points .", 
                "theresa may with mark carney , governor of the bank of england , after her speech .",
