                "from beijing , my colleague tom phillips sums up the dramatic action in china today : china halted the day 's trading within 30 minutes of opening on thursday morning as shares plunged by more than 7 % triggering an automatic circuit breaker and authorities accelerated the devaluation of the chinese yuan .", 
                "china 's recently installed circuit breaker mechanism paused trading for 15 minutes after the csi300 index fell 5 % in the first 13 minutes of trading .", 
                "on resumption of trading it fell further , triggering the day 's halt .", 
                "the csi300 index finished down 7.2 % , the sse composite index fell 7.3 % and shenzhen dropped by 8.3 % .", 
                "experts believe that the chinese authorities may have to take fresh steps to prevent the rout deepening , tom explains : christopher balding , a professor of finance and economics at peking university 's hsbc business school , said he expected more government action to halt the stock market drops , whether it is changing the circuit breakers , whether it is again intervening in the market , whether it is extending the ban on large selling by institutions .", 
                "i 'd be surprised if they let this continue going down .", 
                "by almost any measure , the chinese stock market is pretty over valued and so you would be looking at a pretty significant fall to get back to a reasonable valuation .", 
                "i would be surprised if they allowed it to move back to more appropriate levels .", 
                "2016 in china is getting off on the wrong foot .",
