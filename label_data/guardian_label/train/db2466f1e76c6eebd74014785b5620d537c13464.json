                "if he thought that was going to stop his opponents making allegations about number 10 using underhand tactics to try to promote the case for britain staying in the eu , he will be disappointed .", 
                "today a row has erupted involving what is either the biggest conspiracy theory , or biggest conspiracy , depending on who you believe , to hit the headlines since the eu referendum campaign formally started .", 
                "it involves john longworth , the director general of the british chamber of commerce , who used a speech last week to say that he was personally opposed to britain staying in the eu , even though the bcc as a whole had decided to remain neutral .", 
                "he was initially suspended from his post by the bcc 's board and then he decided to resign .", 
                "brexit campaigners are claiming that number 10 was somehow involved .", 
                "the daily mail has splashed on the story .", 
                "neil henderson ( @ hendopolis ) daily mail : an honest man 'knifed by no10 ' # tomorrowspaperstoday # bbcpapers the evidence to justify its headline comes from a quote from a friend of longworth 's '' in the story .", 
                "a friend of mr longworth said : 'john feels he has done everything by the book and is dismayed at what has happened .", 
                "no 10 has had a hand in this , putting pressure on the bcc board to silence him . '", 
                "as the guardian 's story on this reveals , longworth himself has refused to comment publicly on this suggestion .", 
                "longworth told the guardian by text message on sunday night that he is planning to expand upon his views in the run up to the referendum in june .", 
                "however , he pointedly did not respond to questions asking whether either he or the bcc had been put under pressure by downing street or members of the remain campaign to either suspend him or remove him from office .", 
                "but the bcc itself has issued a lengthy statement insisting that there was no outside influence involved in what happened .", 
                "here 's an excerpt .", 
                "no politician or interest group had any influence on the bcc board decision to suspend mr longworth .", 
                "his subsequent resignation was agreed mutually between mr longworth and the bcc board , and there were no external factors involved .", 
                "the only views taken into account were those of the bcc board and the bcc 's owners , the uk accredited chamber network .", 
                "and this morning michael fallon , the defence secretary , told sky news that brexit campaigners had fallen for bizarre conspiracy theories '' about longworth 's departure .", 
                "this is what he said when asked if he could give an assurance that number 10 , and its officials , had nothing to do with longworth 's resignation .", 
                "i can give you that absolute assurance , because the board of the british chambers of commerce have made it very clear that this was their decision , and there was no external pressure from anybody else .", 
                "people who want to leave europe are seeing conspiracy theories everywhere now because they do n't want to answer the basic questions , which is if you leave europe , where are you going ?", 
                "what are the new arrangements for trade ?", 
                "what is going to happen to the jobs that depend on europe ?", 
                "they have to start answering these questions instead of coming up with rather bizarre conspiracy theories that here the british chambers of commerce have flatly denied .",
