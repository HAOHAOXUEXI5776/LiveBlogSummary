                "now the final figures are out , here are five things we 've learnt from tonight 's polling .", 
                "1 - no one really won '' .", 
                "if you take the view that ed miliband needed a decisive breakthrough , then you could argue that the evening was disappointment for labour , and this is probably the thinking used to justify the ( grotesquely biased ) sun and telegraph front pages .", 
                "( see 11.45pm . )", 
                "but in fact the evening was also quite positive for miliband because 2 - miliband does seem to be rated as a credible prime minister .", 
                "this should be worrying for the conservatives , because they are betting heavily on voters being repulsed by the idea of miliband in number 10 .", 
                "they go on about him being useless so much that some of them even seem to believe it .", 
                "but the public does not seem to feel the same way .", 
                "although cameron is ahead on prime ministerial attributes ( see 11.06pm ) , the overall figures suggest miliband is respected and taken reasonably seriously .", 
                "3 - nicola sturgeon 's appeal goes way beyond scotland .", 
                "all four pollsters were polling in britain , not scotland , and sturgeon even came top in one poll .", 
                "there are english and welsh voters who liked her but who wo n't be able to vote for her .", 
                "where will those votes go ?", 
                "quite a lot to labour , our icm poll suggests ( see 10.28pm ) , although by no means all .", 
                "4 - nigel farage is outperforming his party .", 
                "he was on 21 % in our poll average , although ukip is polling on 13 % .", 
                "( see 7.06pm . )", 
                "he was the most polarising figure on the panel , with 80 % of voters at the other end of the pole to him , but the debate suggests that the more exposure he can get , the more he will be able to mobilise the ukip core vote .", 
                "5 - nick clegg , natalie bennett and leanne wood failed to make an impact .", 
                "clegg and bennett 's debate figures were much the same as their party 's ( see 7.06pm ) , suggesting they were not winning over any new supporters .", 
                "that 's all from me for tonight .", 
                "here 's our splash on the debate .", 
                "an always tense , sometimes disjointed and occasionally cacophonous seven-way live tv leaders debate saw ed miliband just shave ahead of his rivals , according to a snap guardian/icm poll conducted after the event .", 
                "i 'll be blogging again tomorrow with more debate reaction .", 
                "update : and here 's rupert murdoch 's verdict .", 
                "rupert murdoch ( @ rupertmurdoch ) uk debate .", 
                "great performances by snp sturgeon and ukip farage , cameron sort of ok , milliband not , clegg pathetic .",

                "so , at least in that aspect , a debate between actual party leaders is more than what we americans can expect starting in august .", 
                "during the 2012 campaign , for instance , there were 20 debates between the various republican candidates ( the first of which was in may 2011 ) , and as many as nine candidates shared the stage with others clamouring to get in ; during the 2008 campaign , there were 25 live democratic debates and eight candidates participated in seven of them .", 
                "the republicans have decided to limit themselves to nine debates for the 2016 elections ; the democrats might not have any if no one besides hillary clinton runs .", 
                "our primary debates are almost always most notable for the gaffes and errors than the serious business of governing : from rick perry 's oops '' moment in 2012 to barack obama 's you 're likeable enough , hillary '' moment in 2008 , the mistakes are almost always more interesting than the by-the-numbers recitations of the candidates ' canned talking points and their attempts to avoid too many specifics that could hurt them in a general election .", 
                "the final debates between the party nominees are usually more serious-seeming ( john mccain 's dick fingers '' in 2008 when talking about women 's health notwithstanding ) and usually one-on-one ; the last three-way presidential debate was in 1992 , when ross perot joined bill clinton and then-president george hw bush on stage .",
