                "these were the key clashes at the leadership hustings tonight in gateshead europe corbyn said labour must accept the results of the eu referendum and now focus on building new relationships with sister parties and unions all across europe .", 
                "a referendum has taken place and i think we have to recognise that , whatever we feel about it , there is a result from that referendum which we have to work with .", 
                "but smith came out swinging for the labour leader on his lukewarm support for the eu , saying he had described his support before the result as 7/10 for the eu , but said he was now 10 out of 10 for leaving .", 
                "we should still be fighting harder , and if i were the leader i would be saying to the country \u0080\u0098let 's negotiate hard , let 's demand that our mandate , because our people voted in by and large , is properly observed , let 's argue alongside the tories for a proper brexit ' .", 
                "smith says he believes that shows corbyn never really bought into the idea of remaining in the european union .", 
                "are you becoming a mind reader ?", 
                "corbyn asks .", 
                "smith says he does not need to be a mind reader because corbyn had opposed the eu for 30 years .", 
                "during the referendum you seemed to have undergone a damascene conversion .", 
                "gender equality labour have just selected four men as candidates for regional mayoral elections next may and both candidates were quizzed on what the party could do to ensure greater gender equality .", 
                "particularly , both were asked if there should have been some all women shortlists for the mayoral selection processes .", 
                "corbyn says he believes it was not the leader 's job to decide on aws for regional mayors , which should be up to the local party .", 
                "smith , however , said he as party leader would have insisted on at least one all women shortlist .", 
                "the party leader should have insist on one of those [ mayoralties ] , at least , being an all woman shortlist .", 
                "leadership smith 's key argument in areas where both men seemed to agree in principle was about leadership and the electibility of the party .", 
                "all of the policies we want to put in place all of the principles we hold dear are worth nought because we will not be able to translate any of that into power .", 
                "corbyn , whose team have launched a rebuttal website this evening to challenge claims he is not successful electorally , said smith was ignoring the huge surge in membership under his leadership .", 
                "owen , our party is a strong party , our party is a big party , our campaigning abilities are immense if we work together on those campaign .", 
                "but smith said the current tactics were reminiscent of the time the party was out of power for 18 years .", 
                "we 've had mass rallies , we 've had a big party and we 've lost successive elections .", 
                "we know how this one ends , jeremy , and it does n't end well for the working people of britain .", 
                "it 's not about the t-shirts we wear and the badges on our lapels .", 
                "i think people should wear the t-shirs they want to , responded corbyn , calmly .", 
                "defence corbyn says we must have a foreign policy based on human rights , international law , so we become known as a force that is determined to make sure the universal declaration is enforced in all places .", 
                "he says he would aim to eventually lower defence spending , below the 2 % of gdp that nato asks its members to spend .", 
                "later , in a discussion about whether he would ever support military action , corbyn said he would never rule out the possibility , but said there had to be better checks and balances .", 
                "the chilcott report makes pretty sobering reading how we ended up in a war we knew was questionably legal we have to have a different , less aggressive foreign policy .", 
                "smith says he would maintain 2 % .", 
                "we live in a more volatile world when i see the prospect of donald trump in power in america , when i see vladimir putin in charge in russia , i do n't think now is a time for britain to shirk its responsibilities .",
