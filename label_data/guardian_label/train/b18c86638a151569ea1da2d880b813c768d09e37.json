                "in evidence to the joint committee on human rights , which is investigating free speech at universities , he said : as a starter , the television made it look much more dramatic than it was i think a protest of that kind is perfectly legitimate .",

                "we can not look at the case itself so we 'll be examining issues of transparency around the board 's decisions .", 
                "professor hardwick has rightly identified this as a priority himself , so we will give him the opportunity to explain how this might be achieved .",

                "for prisoners like worboys , once they have served the 'tariff ' or the punishment part of their sentence set by a judge , they will be referred to the parole board by the secretary of state and the board must then determine if they are safe to release .", 
                "the test that parole board 's 250 members must apply in deciding whether to release a prisoner is that 'it is no longer necessary for the protection of the public that they should be detained ' ; in other words , the burden is on the prisoner to demonstrate they are safe to release , not the panel to demonstrate they are too dangerous to do so .",

                "if certainty is required that needs to be reflected in the length of the original sentence .",
