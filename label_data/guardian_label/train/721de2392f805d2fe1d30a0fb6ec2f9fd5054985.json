                "an estimated 55 % of voters rejected scottish first minister alex salmond 's plans for his country to become a separate nation although there were big majorities for independence in glasgow , scotland 's largest city , and in dundee .",

                "turnout was approximately 85 % - unknown since the 1950s .", 
                "in an early-morning concession speech , salmond said he accepted the verdict of the people but noted that scotland had not chosen independence at this stage , suggesting he may return to the idea of independence .",
