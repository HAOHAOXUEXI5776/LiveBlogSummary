                "he said : there is general agreement that it would not make sense to ask business to face two sets of changes and that implies that a transition or interim period would need to look a lot like the status quo , otherwise businesses will be making one set of changes at the beginning of the interim period and another set towards the end of it .", 
                "he said dover would not be able to cope if it had to start imposing customs checks from march 2019 .", 
                "explaining why it was preferable to have a transition deal that involved no new customs checks at the eu border ( ie , something akin to be being in the customs union ) , he said dover would struggle even if it only had to carry out relatively quick checks .", 
                "he said : anyone who 's visited dover will know that dover operates as a flow-through port and volumes of trade at dover could not accommodated if goods had to be held for inspection even , i suspect , if they were held for minutes , it would still impede the operation of the port .", 
                "roll-on , roll-off traffic at dover is predicated on trucks rolling off a ferry immediately , out of the port and the ferry reloading and departing pretty rapidly ryanair style turnaround times .", 
                "anything that caused delay in vehicles exiting the port , delay in vehicles offloading , would cause significant disruption to patterns of movement .", 
                "he said , although britain wanted to be able to negotiate new trade deals during the transition period , it accepted it would not be able to implement them if it retained a customs arrangement with the eu similar to the status quo .", 
                "he said : when we leave the european union , we will leave the single market and the customs union as a matter of fact .", 
                "what we would hope to be able to do is negotiate an arrangement with the european union that would allow us to operate across borders between the uk and the eu , our trade in goods and services , in much the way we do today .", 
                "the obvious impediment to such an arrangement is the desire to conclude third party trade agreements with other countries .", 
                "we have been clear during such a period we would want to be able negotiate with third countries but we would not expect to be able to implement them .", 
                "that clears the way to have a harmonised customs agreement .", 
                "he also said he thought agreeing not to implement new trade deals during a transition deal would not be a great sacrifice , because it would take quite a lot of time to negotiate these deals anyway .", 
                "he said that negotiation with fellow eu customs authorities about post-brexit arrangements were being held up because the eu was refusing to open talks on a future trade deal .", 
                "he said : in terms of level of engagement with our nearest neighbours at the customs service level , that has been limited and it has been limited because the view of many of our neighbours is that , until such time as the commission , or the council of ministers , has declared sufficient progress , they are not authorised to engage with us on post-exit planning and post-exit arrangements .", 
                "we have had less engagement than we would like with our customs counterparts with our immediate neighbours both at a technical level and to discuss possible deal scenario technical challenges and no deal scenario technical challenges .", 
                "he said the home office document leaked to the guardian about the government 's post-brexit immigration plans did not reflect current government thinking .", 
                "when it was put to him that , if those plans were implemented , they would prevent the uk negotiating a transition deal that involved accepting free movement , he denied it .", 
                "he said the government 's offer to eu nationals was set out by amber rudd , the home secretary , in july .", 
                "that involved eu nationals being free to continue to come to the uk for a period after brexit provided they registered - a requirement that was allowed under eu law , he said .", 
                "referring to the proposals in the guardian document , which were incompatible with the principle of free movement , he said : i would advise the committee to listen to what the home secretary said , rather than what some document that somebody has dug out from somewhere , which i certainly do n't recognise as our current state of thinking , purports to say .", 
                "he said the budget would be held on wednesday 22 november .", 
                "he said the government wanted to make a value-for-money offer to students .", 
                "he confirmed that the government was looking at how the tuition fee system works , although he refused to confirm reports it will cut the interest rate students pay .", 
                "he implied there would be an announcement in the budget .", 
                "but he stressed that it would not just cover fees .", 
                "he said : i do n't think it would be helpful to look only at the financing side of the equation .", 
                "i think we need to look more broadly at the range of products offered to students , the way in which we offer them , the information that we provide to students to enable them to make value for money assessments about what they are buying and what it is going to cost them .", 
                "and i think our focus should be satisfying ourselves that as government , as a responsible body , what we are offering , the package in the round that we are offering to would-be students , represents a value-for-money offer .", 
                "he suggested there should be more variation in tution fees .", 
                "he said : i do think there 's a significant difference between a graduate who leaves university with a , perhaps , quite significant level of debt and a well-recognised degree in an area which is known to provide strong employment opportunities , and a graduate on the other hand who perhaps has a very similar level of debt but who may not have a degree that is going to enhance his or her employment opportunities in the same way .", 
                "i think we have a responsibility to look at the way the system is working in practice because i think it is probably fair to say the original expectation was that there would be a bigger range of outcomes in terms of fees charged than has actually turned out to be the case .", 
                "he said he was concerned that the current tuition fees system could incentive universities to priorities teaching arts course not science courses .",

                "he said artificial intelligence would quite soon be able to generate some real productivity improvements in the delivery of government services .", 
                "he said : there are very significant areas of government activity which involve relatively low level decision making which will be highly susceptible to the application of artificial intelligence , probably over a relatively short period of time , which does present the tantalising possibility of being able to drive some real productivity enhancement in the delivery of government processes ."
