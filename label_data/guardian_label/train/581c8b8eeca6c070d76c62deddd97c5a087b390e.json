                "protecting their identities was crucial to keep them safe from traffickers who might track them down to extort cash or exploit them further , she insisted , as well as defending experience social workers who were determining the refugees ages .", 
                "rudd has been criticised in previous debates on the issue for a lack of transparency , but with delicate negotiations with the french now agreed , she was more forthright in her criticism of her counterparts , insisting it was the french government that were responsible for the delay in bringing over children without ties to the uk , who qualify under the dubs amendment , rather than the eu 's dublin agreement on family reunification .", 
                "here are some of the key points from her statement and questions : britain will not accept any new children who arrive in calais after the camp has been cleared , with authorities determined to avoid a \u0080\u0098pull factor ' to the french town .", 
                "it is important we do not encourage more children to head to calais , risking their lives in the hands of traffickers .",

                "children likely to be granted refugee status , at high risk of sexual exploitation , and those aged 12 or under will be prioritised .", 
                "councils have volunteered to take children in , although further places will need to identified as more arrive in the coming weeks last week the guardian reported that france 's alain juppe , on course to win the centre-right 's presidential ticket , will seek to overturn the uk-france border treaty which puts the uk border at calais , not dover .",
