                "masipa said the continuing misperception that pistorius had intentionally killed steenkamp was something the court had a duty to correct to prevent unjustified outrage from the public : our courts are courts of law , not courts of public opinion .",

                "but she rejected the defence argument that pistorius ought to be hospitalised or serve a non-custodial punishment , saying the sentence ought to be unpleasant , uncomfortable and painful .", 
                "masipa said the mitigating factors that he was vulnerable on his stumps , believed there was an intruder , tried to save steenkamp 's life and was , in the judge 's view , genuinely remorseful outweighed the aggravating factors , which she listed as using a lethal weapon , with high-grade ammunition , firing four times with no warning shot , and knowing full well there was someone inside the toilet cubicle .",
