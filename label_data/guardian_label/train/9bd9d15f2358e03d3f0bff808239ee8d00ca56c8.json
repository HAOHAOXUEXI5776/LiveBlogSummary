                "albania 's prime minister has criticised michael gove , the justice secretary , for suggesting that the uk should adopt albania 's relationship with the eu .", 
                "given that albania wants to join the eu , edi rama said this was ridiculous '' .", 
                "rama told the world at one : when i heard about it i thought it was a joke .", 
                "then when i read it knowing that mr gove is one of the very intelligent persons in the uk politics i thought it was kind of weird because why in the world brits would have to follow a model we do n't want for ourselves .", 
                "we think it 's the other way round .", 
                "talking about this new bbc - british balkan confederation - is really amazing , but not for serious politics .", 
                "i am sorry to that because i have a lot of respect for mr gove as a person and it 's , let me say bluntly , ridiculous .", 
                "earlier , writing in the times , rama said albania had only limited access to the eu 's market in services , no passport for financial services , its banks could not operate across europe in the way british banks can , and it was outside the eu customs union which meant it faced costly red tape .", 
                "in his speech last week gove said : there is a free trade zone stretching from iceland to turkey that all european nations have access to , regardless of whether they are in or out of the euro or eu.26 after we vote to leave we will remain in this zone .", 
                "the suggestion that bosnia , serbia , albania and the ukraine would remain part of this free trade area - and britain would be on the outside with just belarus - is as credible as jean-claude juncker joining ukip .", 
                "edi rama babani/epa an online poll for icm suggests that president obama 's intervention has not helped the remain campaign .", 
                "the poll , conducted between friday and sunday , shows leave marginally ahead , whereas icm 's online poll the week before showed leave and remain 50/50 .", 
                "here is an extract from the icm write-up .", 
                "following barack obama 's intervention in the eu debate last week , the remain campaign will have hoped for a boost in public support .", 
                "during his three-day visit to london , obama warned that the uk would lose influence if it were to leave the eu , and suggested that it could take up to 10 years to negotiate new trade deals with the us .", 
                "however , this week 's data does little to support this idea .", 
                "leave takes a narrow lead in icm 's eu tracker , with 46 % in favour of leaving compared to 44 % who support remaining in the eu .", 
                "excluding non-voters and dks , this translates as 51 % vs 49 % in the topline numbers .", 
                "interestingly , we do see a hardening of resolve among leave supporters when it comes to turnout , with four in five ( 80 % ) saying they are absolutely certain to vote , compared to 75 % who said the same in our first april poll - perhaps reflecting a sense of displeasure among leave supporters about obama 's comments .", 
                "update : does this show that president obama 's intervention backfired ?", 
                "vote leave seem to think so .", 
                "this is from paul stephenson , its communications director .",

                "long hard fight ahead and this is from dominic cummings , its campaign director .", 
                "odysseanproject ( @ odysseanproject ) as per what i said yesterday , sw1 often misjudges things like obama - 2 polls now out both showing swing to leave : but , even though the polls may have tightened , that does not necessarily mean that obama 's comments were counterproductive .", 
                "in 2014 george osborne 's announcement ( backed by labour and the lib dems ) ruling out a currency union with an independent scotland infuriated the scots , who saw it as a threat and a bluff , and subsequently the no lead shrank .", 
                "but , come polling day , uncertainty about what would happen to the scottish currency and economy in the event of a yes vote was probably decisive in explaining why no won .", 
                "obama 's back of the queue '' comment ( another threat/bluff ) may well impact on the campaign in the same way ; in the short term , it energises the leave camp , but in the long term it may create a firewall of uncertainty that will keep do n't knows on the remain side .",
