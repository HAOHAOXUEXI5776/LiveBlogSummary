                "let 's summarise the developments of the past two days as best we can .", 
                "bill shorten sought an early appearance at the trade union royal commission to deal with a burst of anticipatory reporting about his past as a trade union official .", 
                "his posture was cooperation with the process but his answers were lengthy , and in some cases , lacking in specifics .", 
                "shorten was rebuked on day two by commissioner dyson heydon for seeking an early slot and then providing non-specific answers to various questions not a great look , and perhaps a harbinger of the commission 's eventual reflection on him .", 
                "counsel assisting the inquiry , jeremy stoljar sought to make a case over the two days that the awu under shorten 's leadership was hopelessly conflicted through a pattern of behaviour where the awu would seek payments from various employers at the same time as it was negotiating workplace agreements .", 
                "stoljar 's contention was the awu was serving its own interests by seeking the income and not always adequately tending the interests of the workers , which it allowed to be paid below award wages and be transferred across to labour hire firms .", 
                "shorten 's response to that was it was common for unions to bill companies for services provided , and he said the commission was unable to demonstrate any clear conflict at an evidentiary level .", 
                "when specific payments or arrangements were put to him , shorten consistently told the commission he was not across the fine points , or he lacked a line of sight on the details , or the invoices were prepared by someone else but he was confident nonetheless that he would n't have participated in anything untoward .", 
                "he said thursday he would not have been a party to bogus invoices where the awu pretended to provide services to justify payments from employers .", 
                "he also thought it strange that the commission was seemingly rebuking an official who had tried to be cooperative and deal in a consensual way with the consequences john howard 's labour market deregulation and of structural change in the australian economy rather than pulling workers off worksites sites in an outbreak of futile militancy .", 
                "shorten was forced to admit on day one that a labour hire company had paid for a young campaign director to work with him in 2007 when he left the union and sought his seat of maribynong .", 
                "shorten had , in essence , failed to declare a donation which was worth around $ 40,000 until eight years after the fact , and two days before an appearance at the royal commission .", 
                "the company from which he 'd sought the donation was again in and enterprise negotiation with the awu .", 
                "there was also an awu donation not declared .", 
                "again not at all a good look , but unfortunately shorten is just one of many politicians who fail to comply thoroughly with australia 's highly ineffectual political disclosure regime .", 
                "the law is an ass , but i 'm not optimistic that it will change anytime soon .", 
                "shorten may have to reappear before the inquiry in the event another witness wants to challenge his account over the past 48 hours .", 
                "shorten 's lawyers will also have an opportunity to re-examine him if they so choose .", 
                "so , that was shorten at # turc and it may not be over yet .", 
                "it is , however , over for now .",
