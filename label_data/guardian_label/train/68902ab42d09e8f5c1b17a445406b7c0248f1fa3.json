                "in some respects the term was misleading , because osborne missed his targets and had to rejig his plans , but the claim that the conservatives were on a path towards eliminating the deficit seemed to impress the public and this strategy helped osborne and cameron to win the 2015 general election .", 
                "today philip hammond consigned the ltep to the dustbin .", 
                "in truth , it collapsed the day the uk voted for brexit but hammond had to tell mps that the eu referendum result has blasted a huge hole in the national finances and he has all but abandoned any hope of getting the budget into surplus on his watch .", 
                "osborne 's targets have been abandoned , the government plans to carry on borrowing and spending ( the autumn statement envisages a fiscal loosening of almost \u00e2\u00a3 9bn by 2021-22 ) and , although the treasury hopes to balance the budget in the 2020s , it wo n't say when this might happen .", 
                "all of this is quite sensible , but it is not the economic prudence that won the tories the 2015 election .", 
                "in the past governing parties have been consigned to opposition for a decade or more for economic mismanagement on this scale .", 
                "but there is no sign of this happening to the conservatives .", 
                "cameron did not ask the country to vote for brexit , and nor did hammond , or theresa may .", 
                "hammond 's political authority remains intact .",
