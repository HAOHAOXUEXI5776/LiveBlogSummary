                "from the ira to hamas , from soviet communism to general galtieri , for heaven 's sake .",

                "a guy who pre-emptively informs any power that would threaten to engage in nuclear blackmail that as our prime minister he , corbyn , would not under any circumstances deploy trident , so making a making a nonsense of our nuclear deterrent he is all over the place on our nuclear deterrent .",

                "he claimed that corbyn did not support police shooting marauding terrorists , as happened on saturday night , but this is based on a wilful misinterpretation of the ( admittedly , badly phrased ) interview corbyn gave to the bbc in november , which produced a report judged inaccurate by the bbc trust .", 
                "( corbyn did say that he was not happy with a shoot-to-kill policy in general , but he seemed to have in mind northern ireland-style state assassination and was not saying he disapproved of armed intervention to save lives . )", 
                "johnson 's point about corbyn voting against the 1989 security services act , that put mi5 on a statutory footing , is correct - you can read the hansard here - but the entire labour party voted against the bill , and not because they wanted to abolish mi5 , but because the party had technical objections to the way the legislation was drafted .", 
                "and corbyn and abbott did vote against banning al-qaeda , but it was an order banning 20 other organisations too , and leftwingers thought that some of those groups were unfairly included .",

                "corbyn said so on the today programme in september 2015 and he faced a very difficult 10 minutes on the question time leaders 's special on friday when he refused to say explicitly whether or not he would be willing to authorise a retaliatory nuclear strike if britain were attacked .",
