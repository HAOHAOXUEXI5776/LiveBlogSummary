                "rather it is the ratio of food exports and imports , it measures how much of the food we eat is produced in country .",

                "it 's more a measure of competitiveness . ''",

                "but wilkinson says a figure of around 60 % is historically average .",

                "during the 1930s , the country was at around 30 % -40 % .", 
                "figures from defra date back to 1956 and show that the year 1984 that the nfu have chosen as their baseline was the absolute peak of self-sufficiency during the past half century .", 
                "wilkinson says an increase in the self-sufficiency ratio could be increased by exporting more food while keeping imports constant , thus the nfu 's attempt to link the situation to food security is non-sensical '' .", 
                "we would be much more vulnerable if we were to become 100 % self-sufficient . ''",

                "peter melchett , soil association policy director says sustainable food production can be increased by shifting the focus away from energy , biofuel and meat production toward fruit and vegetables .", 
                "he echoes the nfu in their calls for more research in the sector and an emphasis on buying locally produced food .", 
                "we could do a great deal to increase more environmentally sustainable food production in the uk .", 
                "first , and most obviously , we could stop allocating ever increasing areas of farmland to growing maize for anaerobic digestion plants and oil seed rape for fuel .", 
                "second , we could increase our production of fruit and vegetables , where relatively small areas of land produce big quantities of food which we currently often import unnecessarily , like apples .", 
                "third , we should invest in research , neglected for 70 years , that will help us increase production from farming systems which do not rely on environmentally unsustainable inputs like manufactured nitrogen fertiliser , imported mined phosphate and pesticides .",
