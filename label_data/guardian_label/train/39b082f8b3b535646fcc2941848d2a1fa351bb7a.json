                "here are the main lines from michael gove 's performance on sky news .", 
                "michael gove , the justice secretary and co-chair of the vote leave campaign committee , seemed to accept that people could lose their jobs if britain left the eu .", 
                "asked whether he could guarantee no-one would lose their job as a result of brexit , gove said : i ca n't guarantee every person currently in work in their current job will keep their job .", 
                "when asked who would lose their job , he went on : seventy-three members of the european parliament will be losing their job .", 
                "our european commissioner will be losing his job and as far as i 'm concerned i wish them well in the private sector .", 
                "he claimed he was glad that none of the big economic organisations are backing brexit .", 
                "he would rather take the advice of business people , he said .", 
                "if you are talking about some of the independent economic authorities who 've already weighed into the debate , they are people who have been wrong in the past .", 
                "they are organisations , i 'm afraid , that did n't predict the global crash in 2008 and the same organisations in many cases who said we should be inside the single currency .", 
                "i am glad that all these organisations are not on my side .", 
                "margaret thatcher said about economists , the great thing is that economists are fine but you must n't inhale .", 
                "i prefer to take the view of businesspeople who are actually generating jobs and creating wealth .", 
                "the organisations that many people are citing in this debate are organisations that have been wrong in the past and i think they are wrong now .", 
                "he claimed that the eu was supported by unelected , unaccountable elites '' , and that the leave camp , in contrast , represented the people .", 
                "it 's the invincible arrogance of europe 's elites that gets me .", 
                "these are people who have seen the euro collapse .", 
                "these are people who are presiding over a migration crisis on their borders , and yet do they ever acknowledge that they need to change ?", 
                "no .", 
                "they say they need more integration , more of our money , more control over this country .", 
                "i think it 's time that we said to people who are incapable of acknowledging that they 've ever got anything wrong : 'i 'm sorry , you 've had your day . '", 
                "unelected , unaccountable elites , i 'm afraid it 's time to say 'you 're fired .", 
                "we are going to take back control ' .", 
                "he defended the vote leave claim that eu membership costs the uk \u00a3 350m a week , despite the fact that it has been widely described by experts as untrue .", 
                "and he said he would be happy to have that figure independently audited .", 
                "he claimed that most people in the uk were suffering '' because of the eu .", 
                "the majority people in this country are suffering because of our membership of the eu .", 
                "i know myself from my own background , the eu depresses employment and destroys job .",

                "taxpayers are handing money over to be spent on jean claude juncker 's expense account and private jet .", 
                "he said he was not worried about experts not backing brexit because he wanted the public to trust not experts but themselves .", 
                "i 'm not asking the public to trust me , i 'm asking the public to trust themselves .", 
                "he accused sky 's faisal islam of adopting a stance of sneering condescension '' towards leave campaigners because islam said gove and his team were following in the steps of donald trump .", 
                "gove replied : i think it is wrong of you to say that people who want our democracy restored and believe britain should be a self-governing nation are people who are following in the footsteps of donald trump .", 
                "it is that sort of sneering condescension towards people who believe in democracy that discredits those on the remain side of the campaign .", 
                "he said he was absolutely not '' considering a bid for the conservative leadership .", 
                "there are lots of talented people who could be prime minister , but count me out whatever poster you put up , do not put up one of me !", 
                "he revealed that he did not support the government 's bid to stop the eu imposing a cap on bankers ' bonuses .", 
                "others defended that stance by the government , but he did not , he said .", 
                "i 'm not interested in defending the position of those who already have privilege .", 
                "i explained to my cabinet colleagues that we should not be on the side of the undeserving rich .", 
                "we have in the eu a market rigged in favour of the rich and stacked against the poor .", 
                "he criticised david cameron for relying on pessimism '' when he was interviewed on sky yesterday to put the case for remain .", 
                "gove was compared by a member of the audience to a first world war general , sending people over the top without caring what would happen next .", 
                "( see 10.17am . )", 
                "he admitted that he was wrong to support the iraq war .", 
                "he suggested the government could spend money support the british steel industry if the uk left the eu .", 
                "if we vote to leave , one of the things we can do is support industries that are going through terrible times .", 
                "in the eu there are rules that prevent us from providing support in the way we might want to .", 
                "we would have additional flexibility to help industries that really need it .", 
                "i think if we were outside the eu , we would be able to support industries in difficult times the free market is not a god the government should step in on certain occasions .",
