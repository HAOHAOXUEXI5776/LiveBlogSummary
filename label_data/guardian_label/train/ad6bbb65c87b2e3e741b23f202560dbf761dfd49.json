                "the government will make sure the nhs gets appropriate funding to ensure it does not lose out , the prime minister 's spokesman said .", 
                "in terms of the nhs , the government will make sure that the nhs has the appropriate funding to cover any changes to hospitals ' costs , including negligence costs .", 
                "when it was put to him that the cost to the nhs would be about \u00e2\u00a3 1bn , the spokesman said the final calculations were still being worked out but that \u00e2\u00a3 1bn was probably broadly in the right ball park .", 
                "the spokesman did not dispute the suggestion that the announcement will also lead to insurance premiums going up , but he said that ultimately this was a commercial matter .", 
                "he said that the announcement was made by liz truss , the justice secretary , in her capacity as lord chancellor , in accordance with her legal obligations .", 
                "truss has explained her move in a written ministerial statement today .", 
                "she said : under the damages act 1996 , i , as lord chancellor , have the power to set a discount rate which courts must consider when awarding compensation for future financial losses in the form of a lump sum in personal injury cases .", 
                "the current legal framework makes clear that claimants must be treated as risk averse investors , reflecting the fact that they may be financially dependent on this lump sum , often for long periods or the duration of their life .", 
                "the discount rate was last set in 2001 , when the then-lord chancellor , lord irvine of lairg , set the rate at 2.5 % .", 
                "this was based on a three year average of real yields on index-linked gilts .", 
                "since 2001 , the real yields on index-linked gilts has fallen , so i have decided to take action .", 
                "having completed the process of statutory consultation , i am satisfied that the rate should be based on a three year average of real returns on index-linked gilts .", 
                "therefore i am setting it at minus 0.75 % .", 
                "george freeman , the conservative mp who chairs the prime minister 's policy board , has apologised for what he said yesterday suggesting that some people with mental health problems are not really disabled .",

                "the spokesman said that that no current pip claimants would be affected by the legal changes the government is planning .", 
                "instead , the proposals were intended to restore the original aim of the policy , he said .", 
                "clearly , the government is committed to ensuring the welfare system is a strong safety net for those who need it .",
