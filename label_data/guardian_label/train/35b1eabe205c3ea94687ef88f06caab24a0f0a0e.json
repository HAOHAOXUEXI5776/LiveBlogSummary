                "morrison said he believed times for indigenous affairs had never been bleaker than under senator scullion 's watch , when aboriginal and torres strait islander affairs were folded into the department of prime minister and cabinet . ''", 
                "morrison praised the strength of the northern territory 's aboriginal land rights act and accused scullion of holding abiding scorn '' for it against the fragile bundle of rights '' under its federal equivalent .",

                "there 's been no such assurance on the eve of this election , and for as long as nigel scullion remains minister , i believe aboriginal land rights in the northern territory and the important role and functions of the land councils will remain under threat , '' morrison said .", 
                "morrison also criticised scullion over leasing arrangements , and the controversial indigenous advancement strategy .", 
                "senator scullion and his army of bureaucrats failed indigenous australians dismally , yet in the face of a damning senate inquiry he stands up before the nlc full council and claims that , in his words , he 's untangled a mess of programs that had barely made an impact on indigenous intergenerational disadvantage .",
