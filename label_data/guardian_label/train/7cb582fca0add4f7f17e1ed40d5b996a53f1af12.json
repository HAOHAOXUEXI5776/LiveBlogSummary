                "why is the nhs struggling to meet a & e targets and is it symptomatic of a wider crisis ?", 
                "the guardian 's health correspondent denis campbell offered this analysis before today 's figures were published , highlighting some of the major strains on the health service : the nhs is visibly struggling to respond to a growing burden of illness , especially given that its ringfenced budget has disguised the fall in health 's overall share of gdp under the coalition , just when rising need made that ill-advised .", 
                "the ageing population is the main reason and the problem is compounded in the depths of winter , with colds and vomiting outbreaks common obesity , drinking and smoking are producing an ever-larger toll of lifestyle-related diseases such as cancer , diabetes and drink-related liver damage a heavy price is being paid for the lack of health services outside hospitals to keep people healthier for longer at home meanwhile heavy cuts to social care services have followed austerity 's deep cuts to local council budgets .", 
                "older and frail people not properly supported at home are more likely to end up in hospital and probably need to stay there people suffering mental health problems are also adding to the pressures on gps and a & e units because support is not available in the community meanwhile there is a recruitment crisis in the nhs .", 
                "older gps are retiring early to avoid burnout and too few newly qualified doctors are opting to join general practice .", 
                "the result is long waits for appointments - meaning patients increasingly use a & e as their first , rather than last , port of call london ambulance service also says a shortage of paramedics is one reason why it is so stretched .", 
                "there are also concerns that the 111 phone service , which replaced nhs direct , has boosted the number of ambulance call-outs and visits to a & e .", 
                "dr clifford mann , president of the college of emergency medicine , said earlier today that patients should not be blamed for going to emergency departments unnecessarily '' when they have been advised to do so by 111 : the coverage of nhs 111 has gone from about six million to almost the full population .", 
                "and if you look at their figures , you 'll see that there 's been an increase in the number of patients they recommend should attend a & e or they send an ambulance to .", 
                "so we should n't blame the patients when actually they 're simply following the signs or the directions they 've been given .", 
                "this echoes the experience of at least one reader of this liveblog : sanguine6 06 january 2015 10:04am did the service take on a lot of new staff when it was introduced ?", 
                "unfortunately i 've had to call 111 three times in the last few months and to my surprise the operator was on each occasion very keen to send an ambulance out .", 
                "i only accepted once - one call was for a concerning but not life threatening allergic reaction , for which an ambulance had been dispatched before i 'd had a chance to explain all my symptoms .",

                "the figures which are coming out this morning will probably be similar to the ones that came out before christmas which showed that in december we were seeing 20,000 patients a week more in our emergency departments than we were at the same time last year and i think this is what 's created the real problems at the moment .", 
                "we 've reached a tipping point - 20,000 extra patients a week all have to be accommodated within the same bed stock and the same capacity as the system in 2013 .", 
                "he said the expansion of the nhs 111 non-emergency phone line contributing to more people going to a & e .", 
                "there are a number of factors [ explaining the increase ] , one of the most important of which is that the coverage of nhs 111 has gone from about six million to almost the full population .", 
                "and if you look at their figures , you 'll see that there 's been an increase in the number of patients they recommend should attend a & e or they send an ambulance to .", 
                "so we should n't blame the patients when actually they 're simply following the signs or the directions they 've been given .",

                "he said the current funding system penalised hospitals with a & e units .", 
                "the current tariffs mean that you can run a successful and indeed profitable hospital if you do specialist commissioning work and elective care but all acute care loses money - and in times of austerity , it 's difficult to invest properly in an emergency department which they see as a loss-making part of the business .", 
                "he said a & e staff needed more time off , not more pay .", 
                "we also need to recognise that if people are going to be working a lot out-of-hours - and emergency medicine means we do work evenings , nights and weekends frequently - that the right compensation for that is not to pay people more , but to give them more annual leave so the amount of time they can spend with their families and friends is the same as their peers working in other specialties , whatever they may be ."
