                "as katharine murphy reports : the turnbull government will attempt to intensify political pressure on labor over its policy to end cash rebates for excess imputation credits , citing figures suggesting 237,952 pensioners will be hit as backroom arm-twisting continues over its unpopular tax cut for big business .",
