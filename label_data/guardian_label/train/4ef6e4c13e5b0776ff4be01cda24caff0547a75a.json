                "sir alan duncan , the deputy foreign secretary , has reaffirmed the government 's intention to host president trump on a state visit at the end of a three-hour debate that saw mps denounce him as unworthy of the honour .", 
                "the debate , which took place in westminster hall , was prompted by the petition signed by 1.8m people saying trump should be denied a state visit and it was opened by the labour mp paul flynn who , in a wide-ranging attack , described trump 's intellect as protozoan '' .", 
                "( see 4.42pm . )", 
                "mps divided almost entirely along party lines , with conservative mps defending the decision to invite trump ( if not defending his policies ) , but opposition mps criticising trump much more aggressively , and arguing that the honour of a state visit was unmerited .", 
                "but , wrapping up for government , duncan said that state visits were the government 's most important diplomatic tool '' and he made it clear that the government expected the invitation to boost britain 's diplomatic interests .", 
                "he told mps : a state visit is a uniquely british construct .", 
                "no other country is able to offer a state visit in quite the same way as we do .", 
                "it is distinctively british .", 
                "and over the course of her reign her majesty has hosted over 100 of them .", 
                "all such visits are a rare and prestigious occasion .", 
                "but they are also our most important diplomatic tool .", 
                "they enable us to strengthen and influence those international relationships that are of the greatest strategic importance to this country .", 
                "the debate ended without mps voting on whether the visit should go ahead and the debate will have no impact on the government 's plans .", 
                "but , alongside the parallel stop trump protests taking place in parliament square and in other british cities this evening , it illustrated just how much opposition trump will face when he arrives on british soil .", 
                "duncan ended his speech saying he hoped trump would get a polite and generous '' welcome .", 
                "( see 7.20pm . )",

                "theresa may took the highly unusual decision to watch the house of lords begin debating the bill to start the process of leaving the eu , as her most senior minister in the upper chamber warned peers not to try to alter the terms of brexit .",
