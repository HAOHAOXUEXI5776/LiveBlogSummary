                "a crunch meeting of eu interior ministers in brussels called to grapple with europe 's worst modern refugee crisis was also expected to water down demands from the european commission , strongly supported by germany , for the obligatory sharing of refugees across at least 22 countries .", 
                "a four-page draft statement , prepared on monday morning by eu ambassadors before the ministers met , focused on fortress europe policies amid increasing confusion and random setting up of border controls in the schengen free-travel area embarcing 26 countries .", 
                "the draft statement , obtained by the guardian , said that reception facilities will be organised so as to temporarily accommodate people in greece and italy while they are identified , registered , and finger-printed .", 
                "their asylum claims are to be processed quickly and those who fail are to be deported promptly , the ministers say in the draft statement .", 
                "it is crucial that robust mechanisms become operational immediately in italy and greece to ensure identification , registration and fingerprinting of migrants ; to identify persons in need of international protection and support their relocation ; and to identify irregular migrants to be returned .", 
                "the europeans are to set up new rapid border intervention teams to be deployed at sensitive external borders .", 
                "failed asylum-seekers who are expected to try to move to another eu country from greece or italy can be detained , the statement says .", 
                "when voluntary return is not practicable and other measures on return are inadequate to prevent secondary movements , detention measures should be applied .", 
                "the european commission demanded last week that at least 22 eu countries accept a new system of quotas for refugees , with 160,000 being redistributed from greece , italy and hungary under a binding new system .", 
                "germany is insisting on the binding nature of the proposed new scheme and its unilateral decision on sunday to re-establish national border controls within the schengen area was widely seen as an attempt to force those the resisting mandatory quotas to yield .", 
                "the resistance is strongest in eastern and central europe .", 
                "the draft says that the ministers committed to sharing the 160,000 , but made no mention of the system being obligatory , said no formal decision on the matter would be taken until next month and appeared to dilute the commission 's call by describing it as the basis for a decision which would also pay due regard to the flexibility that could be needed by member states in the implementation of the decision , in particular to accommodate unforeseen developments .", 
                "in the medium-term , the draft says , the eu should aim at funding and building refugee camps outside europe and that failed asylum-seekers could be sent from europe to these camps which would not be in their countries of origin .", 
                "the eu should aim at developing safe and sustainable reception capacities in the affected regions and providing lasting prospects and adequate procedures for refugees and their families until return to their country of origin is possible .", 
                "eu governments would then be in a position to find asylum applications of these persons inadmissible on safe third country grounds after which swift assisted return can follow ."
