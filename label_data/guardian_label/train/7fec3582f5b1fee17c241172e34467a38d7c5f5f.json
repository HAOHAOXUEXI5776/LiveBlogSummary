                "this will be remembered as the rosetta speech .", 
                "nick clegg did not explicitly compare his party to the tiny spacecraft that managed to land on a moving comet 500m kilometres away , but , towards the end of his speech , when he talked about the challenge facing the lib dems in 2010 , and the question would we , this brave little party with no experience of national government , have what it takes ?", 
                "`` , it was hard not to see that he was making a connection .", 
                "it was a remarkable metaphor .", 
                "on the up side , the rosetta story is about the triumph of hope and perseverance .", 
                "but on the down side , rosetta is n't coming back .", 
                "sometimes political party conferences are remarkable for what does not happen at them .", 
                "the lib dems still have dire poll ratings ( 7 points in all three of today 's polls , less than a third of where they were in 2010 ) .", 
                "yet , outwardly , there were no recriminations at the conference , and no sign of panic , and even in private the mood seemed to be sober , rather than utterly despondent .", 
                "clegg 's job in his speech seemed to be to assure them all that the last five years had been worth it and , judging by the reaction in the hall , he pulled it off .", 
                "mostly the speech was a recitation of lib dem coalition greatest hits '' , but it did also contain an argument about political change .", 
                "here are the key points .", 
                "clegg has told the lib dems that they have changed the political landscape forever '' .", 
                "in an upbeat speech which could be his last to a party conference ( many people in the party expect clegg to resign as party leader after the election , although a better-than-expected result could see him stay on until the autumn ) , clegg said that the lib dems had broken the two-party system and shown that coalition government could work .", 
                "we changed the political landscape forever .", 
                "five years ago we were told a hung parliament would be a disaster for britain .", 
                "we were told that without a clear majority for one of the old , establishment parties , britain would collapse into chaos .", 
                "we proved them wrong .", 
                "we broke the stranglehold of the two old parties and proved that coalition can be strong , stable and successful .", 
                "we proved that the give and take of different parties working together can be a very british way of getting things done .", 
                "but clegg has not won this argument for good .", 
                "in another part of the speech clegg complained that , for labour and the tories , compromise is treated like a dirty word '' and his aides said ed balls 's interview this morning ( see 10.36am ) , where balls said coalition politics were corrosive '' , illustrated this point .", 
                "perhaps it does , but it also shows that clegg has failed to persuade labour to warm to the idea of coalition government .", 
                "the tories do n't seem too keen either .", 
                "the conservative party 's attack on labour for refusing to rule out a post-election pact with the snp has been partially undermined by george osborne 's refusal to rule out a pact with ukip .",

                "here is a summary of the key points from those interviews , with some analysis .", 
                "ed balls said he thought coalition politics were corrosive '' .", 
                "just a few minutes after he said that , a very senior lib dem figure came into the press room in liverpool where i 'm working to tell us that he thought this was hugely significant , because it indicated that labour were planning to run a minority government if they could .", 
                "this is what balls said .", 
                "i 've got to say i 've always felt coalition politics is corrosive to british public trust .", 
                "and you 've sort of proven why [ a reference to andrew marr 's questions about labour doing a deal with the snp ] .", 
                "george osborne has refused to rule out a conservative pact with ukip after the general election , just as ed balls has refuse to rule out a labour pact with the snp .", 
                "balls was repeatedly pressed on this in his interview , and he said that the idea of a labour/snp pact was nonsense '' , but he would not rule it out .", 
                "ed miliband said it 's nonsense .", 
                "it 's not part of our plans .", 
                "large parties at this stage say they we are fighting for a majority and we are .", 
                "i 'm not getting involved in speculation about post election deals .", 
                "it 's a tory party who want to deflect attention from david cameron 's cowardice on the tv debates .", 
                "the only party who has done a deal with the snp in the last ten years is the tories in scotland in 2011 .", 
                "you can ask george osborne whether or not he 's going to do a deal with ukip .", 
                "michael gove and nigel farage are apparently good friends ; they agree on leaving europe and privatising the nhs .", 
                "marr did indeed ask osborne if he would rule out a pact with ukip .", 
                "like balls , he refused to give that assurance .", 
                "even engaging with nigel farage on this is giving him credibility where he has no credibility .", 
                "the truth is , a vote for nigel farage is a vote for the labour party , a vote for ed miliband as prime minister , and it means no referendum on europe .", 
                "and people need to know that .", 
                "when it was put to him that it was hypocritical of him to challenge labour to rule out a pact when the conservatives would n't , he claimed the situation was different .", 
                "it 's a fundamentally different situation for this reason .", 
                "nigel farage is not going to win seats in the house of commons .", 
                "even on his own estimation , he says he 's going to win a small handful .", 
                "the snp are likely to win dozens of seats because of the collapse of the labour party .", 
                "ed miliband ca n't be prime minister without the support of alex salmond .", 
                "and that creates an alliance between those who want to bankrupt the country and those who want to break up the country .", 
                "the tories believe that repeatedly challenging labour on this , and highlighting ed miliband 's refusal to rule out a labour/snp pact , works to their advantage .", 
                "amongst english voters , it presents labour as a party that would give undue influence to the scots .", 
                "and , for scots voters , it conveys the impression that they could safely vote snp and end up with the labour government they would prefer to the tories .", 
                "( the challenge has another advantage too .", 
                "if labour were to cave in , and rule out any form of pact with the snp , miliband would find his post-election options seriously curtailed .", 
                "remember , when your political opponents challenge you to do something , it is not normally because they are trying to be helpful . )", 
                "osborne 's performance today will make it harder for the tories to run this line of attack with credibility - although , of course , it wo n't stop them .", 
                "in the past grant shapps , the conservative chairman , has ruled out a conservative pact with ukip .", 
                "but osborne is rather higher up the tory chain of command than shapps .", 
                "and osborne is refusing to rule out a pact for exactly the same reason as labour ; because the tories might need one .",
