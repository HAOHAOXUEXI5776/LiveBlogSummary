                "this is not so much a consequence of high initial debt ratios - public debt is in aggregate not higher in the euro area than in the us or japan .", 
                "it reflects the fact that the central bank in those countries could act and has acted as a backstop for government funding .", 
                "this is an important reason why markets spared their fiscal authorities the loss of confidence that constrained many euro area governments ' market access .", 
                "this has in turn allowed fiscal consolidation in the us and japan to be more backloaded .", 
                "thus , it would be helpful for the overall stance of policy if fiscal policy could play a greater role alongside monetary policy , and i believe there is scope for this , while taking into account our specific initial conditions and legal constraints .", 
                "these initial conditions include levels of government expenditure and taxation in the euro area that are , in relation to gdp , already among the highest in the world .", 
                "and we are operating within a set of fiscal rules - the stability and growth pact - which acts as an anchor for confidence and that would be self-defeating to break .", 
                "he then calls for growth-friendly fiscal policies to encourage a up in activity in the whole region .", 
                "draghi makes four suggestions : first , the existing flexibility within the rules could be used to better address the weak recovery and to make room for the cost of needed structural reforms .", 
                "second , there is leeway to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies .", 
                "as a start , it should be possible to lower the tax burden in a budget-neutral way .", 
                "[ 15 ] this strategy could have positive effects even in the short-term if taxes are lowered in those areas where the short-term fiscal multiplier is higher , and expenditures cut in unproductive areas where the multiplier is lower .", 
                "research suggests positive second-round effects on business confidence and private investment could also be achieved in the short-term .", 
                "[ 16 ] third , in parallel it may be useful to have a discussion on the overall fiscal stance of the euro area .", 
                "unlike in other major advanced economies , our fiscal stance is not based on a single budget voted for by a single parliament , but on the aggregation of eighteen national budgets and the eu budget .", 
                "stronger coordination among the different national fiscal stances should in principle allow us to achieve a more growth-friendly overall fiscal stance for the euro area .",
