                "deputy governor woods ( whose first job involved calculating nick leeson 's losses a century later ) explains how barings came unstuck when russia 's government started withdrawing funds .", 
                "fortunately for barings , the city rallied round , but it highlighted the challenge of the bank of england 's light-touch approach to regulating the sector , as woods explains : rumours began to circulate that the firm might not have any surplus left after payment of its liabilities .", 
                "the governor was alerted given the almost unthinkable consequences should barings go down : not only would the failure of the city 's leading accepting house inevitably bring down a host of other firms but the very status of london would be threatened and thus the pre-eminence of the city as an international financial centre '' .", 
                "amidst much to-ing and fro-ing between the bank of england ( hereafter the bank '' ) , the treasury and downing street , it was becoming apparent that the crisis at barings was one not only of liquidity but also of solvency , and that there was now a palpable loss of confidence in the institution throughout the city .", 
                "the bank alone could not afford to act as lender of last resort so eventually the governor of the day - lidderdale - announced the establishment of a guarantee fund for barings ; within half an hour , the city 's top institutions rushed to contribute - the likes of raphaels ( \u00a3 250,000 ) , antony gibbs and brown shipley ( \u00a3 200,000 apiece ) and smith payne & smiths , barclays , morgan and hambros ( each contributed \u00a3 100,000 ) .", 
                "indeed , the leading joint-stock banks had put themselves down for \u00a3 3.25m and by mid-afternoon the fund was up to \u00a3 10m and climbed further to \u00a3 17m by the following week barings was saved .", 
                "but the crisis revealed something about the relationship between the state and industry at the end of the nineteenth century .", 
                "indeed , the institutional set-up explains quite a lot about the approach taken towards the oversight of financial institutions at this time the full speech is on the bank of england 's website , here :"

                "had woods been been there , he 'd have also delivered this warning that part of the reason why only 44 societies are attending this conference rather than the 60+ that came to its equivalent in 2004 lies in the fact that many of those societies were unaware of , or failed to control , the risks they were taking ."
