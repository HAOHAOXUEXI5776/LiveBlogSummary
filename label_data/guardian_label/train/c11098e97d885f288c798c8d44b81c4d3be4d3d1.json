                "a note just published by the ratings agency says : the continuing talks between the greek government and the country 's official creditors are testament to the political will to secure an agreement , but the time-consuming and often confrontational nature of the discussions heightens key risks to the credit profile of the greek sovereign and its banks .", 
                "as for what missing the imf payment means for greece 's already low credit rating , fitch explains : fitch 's sovereign ratings reflect the risk of default to private rather than official sector creditors , so missing the imf payment would not constitute a sovereign ratings default , but it would be credit negative .", 
                "arrears to the imf by a high-income economy are unprecedented and would indicate extreme liquidity stress .",
