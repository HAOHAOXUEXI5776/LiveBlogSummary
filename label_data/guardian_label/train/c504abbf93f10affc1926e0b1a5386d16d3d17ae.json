                "the broad agreement between the eu and uk allows talks to start in early-2018 on arrangements during the transition period , '' said colin ellis , a moody 's managing director and co-author of the report .",

                "as outlined previously , if there is no deal , moody 's would likely see disruptions to trade and a further fall in sterling , which would severely affect sectors that are heavily dependent on imports and goods flows from and with the eu , including food retailers and ports , highly regulated by current eu frameworks , in particular the uk airport and aviation sector .",
