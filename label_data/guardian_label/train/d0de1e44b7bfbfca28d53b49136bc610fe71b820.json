                "as i hope senator cruz is all too aware from his time chairing the us senate science and space sub-committee , the arctic is a large ocean surrounded by continents while antarctica is a continental ice sheet surrounded by ocean .",

                "but even the senior scientist who looks after the satellite data that cruz likes to cite , says the ground-based temperature measurements are more appropriate when it comes to climate change .", 
                "cruz does not seem so keen to mention those various collections of land-based measurements , which show , for example , that 14 of the 16 hottest years on record have all happened since 2000 .", 
                "the hottest year on record was 2015 , but 2016 will give that a run for its money .",

                "cruz has been telling people that in the 1970s you had liberal politicians and scientists who were talking about global cooling and how we were headed to another ice age .", 
                "while it 's true that a few scientists were writing about possible future cooling , a review of research appearing in academic journals found that between 1965 and 1979 there were more than six times as many papers saying the world was warming .", 
                "only seven academic papers in fifteen years were predicting cooling .", 
                "but to suggest that scientists should not change their mind when presented with evidence fundamentally challenging their ideas is a supremely odd idea .", 
                "pseudoscience as a sort of climax to his splurge , cruz has been saying that climate change is the perfect pseudoscientific theory because it can never , ever , ever be disproven .", 
                "this is a little bit like saying you ca n't disprove that there 's a small community of genetically modified clown people living on uranus ( i suggest a quick check with a long-handled mirror ) .",
