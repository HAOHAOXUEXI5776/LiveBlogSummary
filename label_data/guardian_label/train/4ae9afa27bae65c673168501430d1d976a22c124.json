                "good morning .", 
                "the chinese president xi jinping and his wife peng liyuan arrived at heathrow last night for the first official visit by a chinese head of state since hu jintao in 2005 .", 
                "they were greeted on behalf of the queen by viscount hood and by foreign secretary philip hammond .", 
                "today president xi will receive a ceremonial welcome at horse guards parade which has been adorned with large red flags along side the union jack before travelling in a carriage procession along the mall to buckingham palace .", 
                "xi is also expected to address members of parliament and will meet jeremy corbyn this afternoon .", 
                "he will then be welcomed at a state banquet at buckingham palace this evening .", 
                "hammond has just been speaking on the bbc 's today programme , defending the government against criticism for the seeming warmth of the uk 's developing relationship with china .", 
                "i do n't think we 're naive , we go into all relationships with our eyes wide open and we have to make judgements and balances of the different advantages and disadvantages of any relationship that we go into .", 
                "let 's be clear , the united states is out closest ally and will remain our closest ally .", 
                "we have a strong strategic partnership with the united states but that does not prevent us from engaging with a country like china , which has an increasingly important economy , which has been emerging into the international community , playing an increasing role and we want to be able to work with the chinese to be able to shape the way they engage with the world , to be able to carry out activities with them that are in the mutual interest peng liyuan , wife of chinese president xi jinping , escorted by foreign secretary philip hammond .", 
                "melville/ap i think we are developing a mature relationship with the chinese , they know that we are looking , not just to china , but to many other countries for infrastructure investments in the uk .", 
                "chinese investors are very keen to have a piece of this action .", 
                "there are n't many stable , mature economies around the world that are open to large scale infrastructure investment and we are one of them .", 
                "we have a separate live blog on the chinese state visit here , but i 'll bring you some of the more political developments from the story .", 
                "this afternoon in the commons there will be an opposition day debate on the government 's tax credits plans .", 
                "paul johnson , head of the institute for fiscal studies which served the government a blow when it announced after the budget that unequivocally , tax credit recipients in work will be made worse off was speaking on the today programme earlier .", 
                "[ work incentives ] are an important part of the whole tax credit system and in the end that is part of the reason why tax credits were introduced in the first place and it 's probably important to be clear that , wherever we end up in 2017 , it 's still going to be a much more generous system than we had back in 1997 , the total level of spending back to around 2003 levels , not back to a world before tax credits .", 
                "but , he said : actually these changes , they 're certainly hitting people further down the income distribution than the changes that were made under the last parliament but the chancellor made quite a big choice in the budget , he 's decided actually to hit people in work rather harder than people out of work .", 
                "in this morning 's papers , george osborne has claimed that if he had not acted to slash the tax credits bill then \u00e2\u00a3 15bn worth of spending cuts would have had to be found elsewhere .", 
                "he made the comments to coincide with a meeting of the party 's 1922 backbench committee , many of whom are said to be anxious about the effect the cuts to tax credits ( the first round of which will come in before christmas ) will have on their constituents .", 
                "i 'll be covering for andrew this week , bringing you breaking political news as it happens , as well as bringing you the best reaction , comment and analysis from the web .", 
                "if you want to follow me or contact me on twitter , i 'm on @ twitterid ."
