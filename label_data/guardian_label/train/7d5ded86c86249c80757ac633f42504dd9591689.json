                "here are the key points : iain duncan smith has resigned as work and pensions secretary , saying that cuts to disability benefits were indefensible in the context of a budget that boosted the fortunes of the better-off .", 
                "in a blistering letter to the prime minister that was also widely viewed as an attack on the chancellor , george osborne , he pointed the finger at the treasury for placing too much emphasis on money-saving exercises : i am unable to watch passively while certain policies are enacted in order to meet the fiscal self-imposed restraints that i believe are more and more perceived as distinctly political rather than in the national economic interest .", 
                "too often my team and i have been pressured in the immediate run up to a budget or fiscal event to deliver yet more reductions to the working-age benefit bill \u0080\u00a6 i hope as the government goes forward you can look again \u0080\u00a6 at the balance of the cuts you have insisted upon and wonder if enough has been done to ensure \u0080\u0098we are all in this together ' .", 
                "in a reply notable for its lack of warmth , david cameron said he was puzzled and disappointed by duncan smith 's decision , pointing out that they had worked together on the changes to disability benefits : that is why we collectively agreed you , no 10 and the treasury proposals which you and your department then announced a week ago .", 
                "today we agreed not to proceed with the policies in their current form and instead to work together to get these policies right over the coming months .", 
                "in the light of this , i am puzzled and disappointed that you have chosen to resign .", 
                "the resignation came as news emerged that proposed reductions in pip payments to disabled people which the chancellor had said would save \u00e2\u00a3 4.4bn over the course of this parliament would not go ahead in their current form .", 
                "there was speculation that the unexpected move by duncan smith a prominent brexit supporter had more to do with the government 's internal divisions over the coming eu referendum than with genuine discord over cuts to disability benefits .", 
                "but others pointed to longstanding tensions between the treasury and the dwp over how and how fast such cuts should be implemented .", 
                "is iain duncan smith 's resignation about disability cuts or europe ?",

                "duncan smith has questioned the way cuts have been targeted in the past ; before the election he let it be known that he thought there was a case for putting the squeeze more on wealthy pensioners , and means-testing the winter fuel payment , so it is not as if his concerns are 100 % new .", 
                "but nevertheless it is odd that he has decided to resign now , when his department announced the pip cuts a week ago today .",

                "it has been focused on universal credit , duncan smith 's flagship policy at the department for work and pensions , and and a measure that is currently being rolled out nationwide .", 
                "universal credit is supposed to simply the welfare system , by combining six benefits in one , but , crucially , it was also intended to increase the incentive to work , by ensuring that working always pays more than staying on benefits .", 
                "however , under pressure from the treasury , the mechanics of universal credit ( tapers , the work allowance etc ) have repeatedly been changed , with the effect of making the benefit less generous and the work incentives much weaker .", 
                "a recent report from civitas said universal credit had been watered down to such an extent that if creating an incentive to work is the goal , the present system [ ie , what was in place before universal credit ] meets that goal more effectively .",
