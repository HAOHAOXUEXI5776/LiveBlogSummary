                "sir john chilcot has announced that his long-awaited report into the iraq war will be published on wednesday 6 july .", 
                "the eu referendum campaign has intensified with david cameron and boris johnson , effectively the main figureheads for remain and leave respectively , both giving major speeches on the subject .", 
                "they were both long and substantial speeches , but both men may overstated their case .", 
                "cameron was accused of scaremongering after he included a passage in his speech suggesting that leaving the eu could increase the chance of war in europe .", 
                "he said : isolationism has never served this country well .", 
                "whenever we turn our back on europe , sooner or later we come to regret it the serried rows of white headstones in lovingly-tended commonwealth war cemeteries stand as silent testament to the price that this country has paid to help restore peace and order in europe .", 
                "can we be so sure that peace and stability on our continent are assured beyond any shadow of doubt ?", 
                "is that a risk worth taking ?", 
                "i would never be so rash as to make that assumption .", 
                "it 's barely been 20 years since war in the balkans and genocide on our continent in srebrenica .", 
                "in the last few years , we have seen tanks rolling into georgia and ukraine .", 
                "and of this i am completely sure .", 
                "the european union has helped reconcile countries which were once at each others ' throats for decades .", 
                "britain has a fundamental national interest in maintaining common purpose in europe to avoid future conflict between european countries .", 
                "and that requires british leadership , and for britain to remain a member .", 
                "the truth is this : what happens in our neighbourhood matters to britain .", 
                "cameron 's claim that the eu has helped maintain peace in the eu is relatively uncontentious , but his assertion that this requires continued british membership is more questionable .", 
                "johnson claimed that even cameron himself did not believe what he was saying .", 
                "but johnson 's own speech was overshadowed by what he said in the q & a afterwards , when he appeared to blame the eu for provoking russia into invading ukraine .", 
                "( see 1.44pm . )", 
                "this lead to jack straw , the former labour foreign secretary , and others calling him a putin apololgist .",

                "he says : we also need to reflect on the impact of what we do and say here on the public outside , across the country .", 
                "i do n't expect , or even want , blind loyalty , but members and supporters expect us all to focus on taking on the tories - and for our debates to be focused on policy , not personality .", 
                "members also tell me that they do n't think labour mps should be parading on the media to give a running commentary on our party .", 
                "if we are on the media we are there to give our verdict on this failed and divisive government , not on each other .", 
                "he is also going to tell the plp the election results were mixed '' for labour .", 
                "he says : jon trickett set us the target of closing the gap with the tories at the 2015 general election .", 
                "last year we were nearly seven points behind .", 
                "the projection from thursday 's results by the bbc and professor john curtice shows that nationally we are now a point ahead of the tories in our national share of the vote .", 
                "last week we won all four mayoral elections , including the two gains in london and bristol , we made a net gain in the number of labour councils across england , we held councils across the south , we scored the second best result in wales since devolution , and we made a net gain of three police and crime commissioners .", 
                "but let 's be clear .", 
                "the results were mixed .", 
                "we are not yet doing enough to win in 2020 .", 
                "this is only the first stage in our task of building a winning electoral majority , attracting voters from all the other parties and mobilising those who have been turned off politics altogether - as we did last week in bristol and london .", 
                "andrew travers , the chief executive of barnet council has left his post after an election-day blunder resulted in many people in the north london borough being unable to vote .", 
                "matthew elliott , chief executive of vote leave , has been giving a public dressing down after refusing to appear before mps .", 
                "as the press association reports , andrew tyrie , chair of the commons treasury committee , said elliott had only agreed to give evidence to a hearing this afternoon after they had issued a parliamentary order summonsing him to appear .", 
                "he told elliott : this is the first time that certainly i 've ever felt the need to issue such a thing [ parliamentary order ] in order to secure a witness .", 
                "i think frankly the difficulty of getting you here is scarcely consistent with the application that you have put to be the lead campaigner for leaving the eu .", 
                "do you have any appreciation of what it looks like to a group of mps that you are telling them you would rather go to switzerland than turn up ?", 
                "elliott claimed it had always been his intention to give evidence to the committee - which is looking at the economic costs and benefits of eu membership - at the earliest possible opportunity '' .", 
                "swing voters in the key parliamentary seat of nuneaton told pollsters jeremy corbyn was old-fashioned '' and scruffy '' when they went to assess the party 's prospects of seizing it back in 2020 .", 
                "that 's all from me .",

                "the speech was titled the liberal cosmopolitan case to vote leave '' and at its heart was a bold claim about brexit being the great project of european liberalism '' - based on johnson 's argument that the eu has lost democratic legitimacy .", 
                "he was particularly interesting on the origins of the eu and on the attempt to create a european consciousness .", 
                "but the speech also included a long ( and impressively dull ) passage intended to counter the argument that single market membership has enhanced trade .", 
                "but some of the most interesting material came in the q & a session afterwards .", 
                "david cameron takes questions after his speeches , but normally only about three .", 
                "to his credit , johnson took a wider range of questions , and seemed genuinely willing to engage with reporters .", 
                "here are the key points .", 
                "johnson said that david cameron himself did not believe cameron 's claim about brexit increasing the chances of war .", 
                "asked about this in the q & a he said : i do n't think the prime minister can seriously believe that leaving the eu would trigger war on the european continent given that he was prepared only a few months ago to urge that people should vote leave if they failed to get a substantially reformed european union .", 
                "we have not got a substantially reformed european union i think it is very , very curious that the prime minister is now calling this referendum and warning us that world war three is about to break out unless we vote to remain .", 
                "i think that is not the most powerful argument i 've heard .", 
                "he said scaremongering of this kind was unpatriotic .", 
                "the biggest single threat that i can see is that people on the remain camp will continue to run scare stories about world war three , or bubonic plague , or whatever it happens to be , and they may in the end inadvertently do material damage to people 's confidence about this country .", 
                "and he urged cameron to think very hard '' before making claims of this kind .", 
                "i think that people should think very hard before they make these kind of warnings .", 
                "i do n't believe that leaving the eu would cause world war three to break out on the european continent .",

                "i saw the disaster when the eu was charged with sorting out former yugoslavia , and i saw how nato sorted it out .", 
                "in his q & a johnson went further , appearing to blame the eu for provoking russia to intervene in ukraine .", 
                "he said : the european union , as you will remember , exacerbated the problems by the premature decision to recognise croatia .", 
                "and if you want an example of eu foreign policy making on the hoof , and the eu 's pretensions to running a defence policy that have caused real trouble , then look at what has happened in ukraine .", 
                "i think it is very , very important that we do n't muddle up the role of the eu with the role of nato what worries me now is that it is the european union 's pretensions to run a foreign policy and a defence policy that risk undermining nato .", 
                "we saw what happened in bosnia .", 
                "we 've seen what happened in the ukraine all the eu can do in this question , in my view , is cause confusion and , as we 've seen in the balkans , i 'm afraid a tragic incident , and in the ukraine things went wrong as well .", 
                "the argument that the eu provoked russia into invading ukraine is one that has also been made by the ukip leader nigel farage .",

                "he claimed brexit was now 'the great project of european liberalism '' .", 
                "i find if offensive , insulting , irrelevant and positively cretinous to be told - sometimes by people who can barely speak a foreign language - that i belong to a group of small-minded xenophobes ; because the truth is it is brexit that is now the great project of european liberalism , and i am afraid that it is the european union - for all the high ideals with which it began , that now represents the ancien regime .", 
                "it is we who are speaking up for the people , and it is they who are defending an obscurantist and universalist system of government that is now well past its sell by date and which is ever more remote from ordinary voters .", 
                "he said it was bizarre '' that cameron was claiming to have reformed the eu when that was not the case .", 
                "it is above all bizarre for the remain campaign to say that after the uk agreement of february we are now living in a reformed '' eu , when there has been not a single change to eu competences , not a single change to the treaty , nothing on agriculture , nothing on the role of the court , nothing of any substance on borders - nothing remotely resembling the agenda for change that was promised in the 2013 bloomberg speech to call this a reformed eu is an offence against the trades descriptions act , or rather the eu unfair commercial practices directive that of course replaced the trades descriptions act in 2008 .", 
                "the eu system is a ratchet hauling us ever further into a federal structure .", 
                "he said the government 's declaration that it would cut net migration below 100,000 when this was not happening was deeply corrosive of popular trust in democracy '' .", 
                "it is deeply corrosive of popular trust in democracy that every year uk politicians tell the public that they can cut immigration to the tens of thousands - and then find that they miss their targets by hundreds of thousands , so that we add a population the size of newcastle every year , with all the extra and unfunded pressure that puts on the nhs and other public services .", 
                "he said joining the single market had not boosted british trade and growth .", 
                "to make his case , johnson used some of the argument in this lengthy civitas report which makes the same argument .", 
                "he said the eu 's trade record was very poor , and that the deals it struck did not favour the uk .", 
                "as for the argument that we need the muscle of eu membership , if we are to do trade deals - well , look , as i say , at the results after 42 years of membership .",

                "bravo .",

                "why ?", 
                "because negotiating on behalf of the eu is like trying to ride a vast pantomime horse , with 28 people blindly pulling in different directions .", 
                "for decades deals with america have been blocked by the french film industry , and the current ttip negotiations are stalled at least partly because greek feta cheese manufacturers object to the concept of american feta .",

                "but it is notable that even when the eu has done a trade deal , it does not always seem to work in britain 's favour .", 
                "in ten out of the last 15 deals , british trade with our partners has actually slowed down , rather than speeded up , after the deal was done .", 
                "he said there was no public support for federalism in europe because there was no shared sense of european identity .", 
                "there is simply no common political culture in europe ; no common media , no common sense of humour or satire ; and - this is important - no awareness of each other 's politics , so that the european union as a whole has no common sense of the two things you need for a democracy to work efficiently .", 
                "you need trust , and you need shame .", 
                "there is no trust , partly for the obvious reason that people often fail to understand each other 's languages .",
