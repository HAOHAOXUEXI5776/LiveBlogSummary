                "he made this point when setting out the commission 's four priorities for the negotiation .", 
                "he also said that the uk would not be allowed to cherry and that the four freedoms were indivisible ( meaning the eu will not allow free movement of goods to the uk without the uk also allowing free movement of labour ) .", 
                "barnier said : first , unity .",

                "this determination is shared by all governments .", 
                "second , being in the european union comes with rights and benefits .",

                "third , negotiations will not start before notification .", 
                "fourth , the single market and its full freedoms , its four freedoms , are indivisible .", 
                "cherry is not an option .", 
                "downing street responded by saying that there was nothing new about the insistence on no cherry but angela merkel , the germany chancellor , made the same point in a speech this morning ( see 11.57am ) .", 
                "with some in uk government circles still apparently believing that cherry is an option ( or have cake and eat it '' , as it is termed at westminster ) , barnier 's warning still carries force .", 
                "he said the actual brexit talks would have to conclude within 18 months .", 
                "that was because , even though article 50 allows for a two-year withdrawal process , the european commission would need some time at the start to prepare , and around five months would have to be set aside at the end for the european council , the european parliament and the uk parliament to ratify the deal .", 
                "so in practice the talks would have to wrap up by october 2018 , barnier said .", 
                "it 's clear that the actual negotiation period will be shorter than two years : the european council must set its guidelines at the beginning , and at the end the agreement must be approved by the council , the parliament and the uk government .", 
                "all in all , there will be less than 18 months .", 
                "if , as theresa may has said , we receive notification by the end of match , it is safe to say the negotiations could start a few weeks later and article 50 agreement would have to reached by october 2018 .", 
                "this truncated timetable seemed to take number 10 by surprise this morning , and it will intensify pressure on the uk government to agree to a transitional deal , because negotiating an all-encompassing final deal in 18 months will be even harder than negotiating one in two years .", 
                "he indicated that he wanted to negotiate the terms of britain leaving the eu before negotiating a final free trade deal between the uk and the eu .", 
                "the one would have to come after the other , he suggested .", 
                "this is important because david davis , the brexit secretary , has said that he wants the two negotiations to be conducted in parallel .", 
                "but barnier argued that the final free trade deal would have to be negotiated with the uk once it was a third country '' - ie , once it was outside the eu .", 
                "he said : it is quite probable that a future agreement on a future relationship will be of a different legal nature .", 
                "it will have to be signed with a third country , and only with a third country .", 
                "so , legally , these things can not be done together at the same time , even though what the future relationship may be may shed light on the usefulness of a very limited transitional period , and may even impact on some of the elements of the negotiation itself .", 
                "barnier indicated that he was open to offering the uk a transitional deal .", 
                "he said he did not think it would be possible to negotiate a final deal in the 18 months available .", 
                "you ca n't do everything in 15 to 18 months of negotiations .", 
                "we are going to have to take things step by step in the right order .", 
                "asked about a transitional deal , he said this might be useful in some circumstances .", 
                "there would be some point and usefulness to a transitional period if it is the path towards a future agreement on this new partnership .", 
                "a transitional deal could keep the eu in the single market or the customs union for a few years after brexit , pending a final trade deal , to minimise the impact of withdrawal on business .", 
                "on this point barnier is taking a similar view to david davis , who suggested last week he might favour a transitional deal , but only on condition that it was agreed what would happen afterwards .", 
                "davis would not approve of one simply as a means of prolonging the negotiations , he suggested .", 
                "barnier said finding a solution for ireland that did not threaten the good friday agreement would be a priority .", 
                "asked about the impact of brexit on ireland , and on the ireland/northern ireland border , he replied : the uk 's decision to leave the european union will have consequences , in particular perhaps for what are the eu 's external borders today .",
