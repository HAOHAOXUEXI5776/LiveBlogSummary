                "alicia higson , senior economist at the centre for economics and business research , says : it is likely this will be a short-lived bout of deflation and the uk will returning to inflation later this year .",

                "as alan clarke , economist at scotiabank , put it : while food price deflation of close to 4 % year on year may sound extreme , this represents something of a relief after years of rapid price increases .", 
                "more specifically , over the seven years between 2007 and 2013 , the average annual pace of increase in food price inflation was 5 % per year .",
