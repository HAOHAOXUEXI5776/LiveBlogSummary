                "ukip has elected diane james as its first female leader , as the party faces a struggle for relevance after the brexit vote and departure of nigel farage .", 
                "as rowena mason and peter walker report , james , a former parliamentary candidate who came close to taking eastleigh off the liberal democrats in 2013 , won with 47 % of the vote out of a wide field of relative unknowns .", 
                "the 56-year-old former businesswoman will have to contend with a party riven by infighting between various factions , including farage loyalists , a circle around the former conservative cabinet minister neil hamilton , and others close to douglas carswell , the party 's only mp .", 
                "james has exerted her authority over the party by axing planned conference speeches by neil hamiltion , leader of the ukip group in the welsh assembly , lisa duffy , her main rival for the leadership , and the other leadership candidates .", 
                "hamilton , and to a lesser extent duffy , are seen as critics of the farage wing of ukip with which james is loosely associated .", 
                "james also said at a press conference that if party members did not agree to back the party reforms she is proposing , they could leave .", 
                "james has accused theresa may of stealing ukip policies .", 
                "in her speech she said : magpie may you have stolen so far our 2 % defence spending , you 've also tried to steal our grammar schools but i think you are going to have a few difficulties getting that one through .", 
                "james has said she will make ukip more professional .", 
                "in her speech she said : professionalism though will be top of my agenda .", 
                "if we are going to reach and achieve the goals this party is still capable of achieving , then change is going to have to happen .", 
                "it is not going to be change for change 's sake , it is not going to be change because i think i want to change it and i ca n't justify it , it is going to be because change is necessary and justified .", 
                "james has said she will not try to copy farage 's approach to leadership .", 
                "she said in her speech : i am not nigel-like , i am not even nigel-lite .", 
                "i 'll never ever pretend to be so .", 
                "what i will be doing is stepping into his leadership shoes , but i will be doing everything to achieve the political success that he 's handing over to me .",
