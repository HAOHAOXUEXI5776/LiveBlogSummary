                "if so , then it would appear the strict spending limits in a number of constituencies were breached , and a criminal offence had been committed .", 
                "it is not clear how any court would decide the status of the battle bus and hotel expenses to be a national or local expense .",

                "in the 1999 case of fiona jones mp , where she was convicted and then acquitted on appeal of a corrupt practice , the lord chief justice ( lord bingham ) made a distinction between an expense ( in that case , rent of an office ) incurred for the promotion of the interests of the candidate and any value [ the expense ] had in raising the party 's profile or making its local presence felt .", 
                "there is no simple absolute divide between the two taking the 1999 and 2005 appeal decisions together , with judgments from senior judges of the highest calibre , it is clear that to prosecute any corrupt practice requires the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that there was dishonesty rather than mere non-compliance .", 
                "and the lord chief justice in the 1999 decision is just as clear that shades of grey expenses where reasonable people may differ in good faith are also not sufficient to establish criminal liability , regardless of any additional requirement to show dishonesty .", 
                "in respect of the current allegations against conservative candidates and agents it would seem that any prosecution for either an illegal or a corrupt electoral practice will need to establish that it was clear that the expenses were such that they should have been on the candidates return ( either in full or part ) .",

                "the answer is yes .",

                "but he said that in the long run raising corporation tax by as much as labour proposed could lead to less revenue than expected being raised .", 
                "two important things about corporation tax first , it 's not a victimless tax .", 
                "this would increase taxes by about 1 % of national income , so it would leave us all in the long run about 1 % worse-off .",

                "so the long run behavioural effect of this tax would result in revenues being less than the immediate headline increase .", 
                "he said the even if labour put corporation tax back up to 26 % , as they propose ( see 9.54am ) , corporation tax would still be not be particularly high by international standards .",
