                "besides , in the week of back to the future ii ( empire pg ) , with its trailer for the third episode shamelessly tacked on to the end , and dozens of trade names shamelessly glaring through its mise-en-scene , field of dreams seems positively purist in its appeal .", 
                "there is very little to say about the new robert zemeckis film that has n't been said about the old one .", 
                "except that it was made back-to-back with a third episode , and there is an extraordinary air of expediency about it .", 
                "the only difference i can find lies in the darker , more spiteful vision of the new film , and the fact that the cast seems almost manically inclined to get through it all as fast as possible and at as high a pitch as the dolby stereo can cope with .", 
                "unless the sound setting at the press show was a mistake , i have seldom heard a noisier film nor one which seems to require its stars ( michael j fox and christopher lloyd again ) to bellow their lines so startlingly over the din .", 
                "whipping off in the doc 's delorean time machine to find 2015 in hill valley , california , a purgatorial version of its former self , with the old labouring under hormonal treatment that has fuddled their brains while rejuvenating their bodies and the young equipped with weapons of world-destruction , marty mcfly returns to discover the mid-eighties in even worse disarray .", 
                "blacks ( perish the thought ) now inhabit his old house and pitched battles between gangs and police make the streets untenable .", 
                "but the trouble with the is that it does absolutely nothing with its various prognostications except play the fool with them .",

                "still , if it 's any consolation , he did like the final part a little more .", 
                "here 's that review , too .", 
                "it was bold of robert zemeckis to persuade hollywood to make back to the future ii and iii back to back , and to put both out within a few months of each other .", 
                "but from the latest returns it looks as if the trick has n't worked at the american box-office .", 
                "be that as it may , back to the future iii ( empire , pg ) is considerably better than the noisy second edition which was plastered with product placement and remorselessly lacking in real coherence .", 
                "this one goes back to first principles and , in particular , to a mythical west where michael fox as marty mcfly , looking younger and smaller than ever , arrives bursting in the magical old delorean through a hoarding de a redskin charge , only to land in the middle of the very same thing in real-life .", 
                "but the indians are not chasing him .", 
                "the us cavalry is only two furlongs behind .", 
                "abandoning the vehicle to a predatory bear , he swaggers in ludicrous western get-up into a frontier town saloon and announces he is clint eastwood which , of course , makes nobody 's day very much at all .", 
                "the whisky literally sizzles on the bar , and some grizzled and vaguely familiar faces from the days when westerns were essentially more nourishing stare at him from the tables .",

                "this is not that .", 
                "it is well-honed and by now rather over-familiar fantasy , through which we are clearly asked to imagine what we might do under such stressful circumstances ourselves .", 
                "as the first film showed , part of the magic of this sort of thing is to make fox into young mr everyman , and mad scientist christopher lloyd into everyone 's idea of the eccentric neighbour whose time , and time-machine , has come .", 
                "zemeckis plugs away at this theme hoping that familiarity will breed content , and varies it this time by making mcfly more or less emmett brown 's sidekick as the story progresses , deferring to him even in the matter of love interest .", 
                "this is provided by mary steenburgen 's schoolmistress , a fellow admirer of jules verne who likes the old boy 's piercing eyes but thinks he 's telling fibs .", 
                "mcfly is left to cope with thomas f wilson 's mad dog tannen , a distant relative of biff , the usual villain , by himself .", 
                "fox also has to play his irish forbear seamus , which he does with an accent that is about as convincing as the part itself .", 
                "there 's a suitably hi-tech flourish at the finish to bring us all back to 1985 , where we started , and there are copious references to the other episodes to satisfy the cogniscenti .", 
                "but a sharper script would have been a benefit and the longueurs of the two hours we spend at the frolic are more noticeable than before , since there are few tricks left even for zemeckis to pull off all that freshly .", 
                "but he remains a director of much professional ease and fluency , and the film has the advantages that flow from that .", 
                "if back to the future iii no longer contains its initial element of surprise , it never seems totally bound by formula ."
