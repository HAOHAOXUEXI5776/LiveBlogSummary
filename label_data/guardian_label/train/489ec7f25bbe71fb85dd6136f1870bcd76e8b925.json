                "good morning blogans , the canberra fog had enveloped parliament house as i trudged in , a little weary as a result of the possum rave on my roof last night .", 
                "it seems every creature from the district was dancing on my flat roof , or perhaps there was a marsupial olym anyway , enough of my problems george brandis is the man of the morning .", 
                "he has been speaking to media this morning after the nsw coroner 's report into the lindt cafe siege which ended with the deaths of tori johnson and katrina dawson as well as the perpetrator man haron monis .", 
                "the coroner had a lot to say about the nsw police service and they way they handled the raid .", 
                "he also had a bit to say about the commonwealth our purview particularly in relation to passing on correspondence that may flag potential security threats .", 
                "this was in relation to a letter monis wrote to the attorney general 's department two months before the siege .", 
                "at the time , brandis told a senate committee : there was no reason to believe that any member of the attorney general 's department staff would have known that monis was a person of concern at that particular time .", 
                "at the time , labor 's mark dreyfus thought that the letter should have prompted further investigation , given it was a letter from a man on bail for serious violence offences , who had been in litigation with the commonwealth in the high court , asking about communication with the head of isil .", 
                "last night brandis was questioned by labor in senate estimates about this comment in the nsw coroner 's report , which says : there does not appear to be an effective policy in place to require the commonwealth bureaucracy to forward correspondence received by it to asio where that correspondence is relevant to security considerations .", 
                "brandis said it was not a consequential letter and the department had changed its practices .", 
                "but after a semantic argument about what constituted an government wide policy , he declined to say that there was one across all agencies .", 
                "he is a little more forthcoming this morning .", 
                "on abc am , brandis said there were no adverse findings of commonwealth agencies but there were helpful suggestions for the feds .", 
                "he said his department had reviewed their processes two years ago .", 
                "the ag 's department also talked to other departments about their processes but brandis said he would check again following the report .", 
                "brandis tries to avoid a question about regretting the failure to pass on correspondence .", 
                "he says post fact reviews including by the head of asio have found the letter would have made no difference to the outcome .", 
                "sabra lane presses him .", 
                "do you personally regret it ?", 
                "well of course because i asked my department to tighten up their correspondence handling practices .", 
                "i would prefer that it had been handed on and if that occurred today it would be handed on .", 
                "the other element of the lindt siege crossing the state-federal boundary relates to when to engage other security agencies and the defence .", 
                "brandis said military call-out powers were being reviewed and a submission would be taken to cabinet .", 
                "plainly there is an argument , particularly when there is a serious terrorist event to deploy all of the capabilities the nation can summon , whether it be the policing and intelligence capability or the military capability .", 
                "if you were not around late yesterday , you may have missed tony abbott 's intervention , rising to the challenge of all things national security .", 
                "shoot to kill , he told 2gb .", 
                "we need to change our protocols dealing with terrorist sieges because terrorists do n't expect to get out alive and they do n't care who they kill .", 
                "i think we do need to give the police a shoot to kill power when they reasonably think they are in a terrorist situation , and we do need to ensure , without supplanting the appropriate role of the police as the lead agency in a terrorist situation , that there is close cooperation , without muddying the lines of command , close cooperation between the military and the police .", 
                "talk to me on the twits @ twitterid on facebook or in the thread .", 
                "writers fest bloke @ twitterid should be back this morning , fog notwithstanding .", 
                "hey ho , let 's go ."
