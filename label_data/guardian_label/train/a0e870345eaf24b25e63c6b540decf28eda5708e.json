                "good morning , and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy , the financial markets , the eurozone and business .", 
                "there 's a fragile feel in the air in the city today - along with a lot of rain - after tuesday 's barrage of gloomy news .", 
                "the 25 % slump in chinese exports , allied to another warning from the imf about economic risks , have punctured the optimism that had been building in the last couple of weeks .", 
                "wall street 's citigroup has created extra anxiety , by warning last night that revenues this quarter will be sharply below forecasts .", 
                "and with the oil price falling back below $ 40 last night , we can all expect more volatility as 2016 shapes up to be an edgy and uncertain year .", 
                "we get a new healthcheck on the uk manufacturing sector this morning , when the latest industrial production data is released at 9.30am .", 
                "economists are hoping for a decent report , as cmc 's michael hewson explains : the manufacturing sector has borne the brunt of the global economic slowdown over the past few months and once again the uk economy is in the cross hairs today with the latest ons manufacturing and industrial production data for january .", 
                "december was an extremely disappointing month with sharp declines in both as 2015 came to a disappointing end .", 
                "the expectation is for a rebound in january with a 0.4 % rise in industrial production , and a 0.2 % rise in manufacturing production this would be in line with a similar improvement seen in the january pmi numbers , but could well prove only temporary given the sharp drop seen in the february pmi data .", 
                "otherwise , there 's not too much afoot , although tensions are building ahead of thursday 's european central bank meeting .", 
                "here 's today 's agenda : 9.30am : uk industrial and manufacturing report for january 3pm : canadian central bank interest rate decision 3pm : niesr publishes its latest estimate of uk growth in the last three months and on the corporate front , we 're getting results from germany utility firm e.on , security firm g4s and eating out chain the restaurant group ."
