                "in an interview with new statesman editor jason cowley , the former first minister of scotland said the snp would vote down the tories in a queen 's speech , after which , under the [ fixed-term ] parliaments act , parties would have a two week period to form another government ( see 5.05pm ) .", 
                "the tories would have to go effectively straight for a vote of confidence , usually the queen 's speech\u0080\u00a6and we 'd be voting against .",

                "salmond also predicted that danny alexander , the lib dem chief secretary to the treasury , and douglas alexander , labour 's election strategy chair , will both lose their seats to his party .", 
                "bob neill , the tory party deputy chairman , has condemned alex salmond for his comments and accused him of making a deeply sinister threat to try to force out the conservatives and lead to the installation of a labour government ( see 8.38pm ) .", 
                "this is a deeply sinister threat from alex salmond , who would do whatever it took to put ed miliband in downing street and under his command .", 
                "the policy demands he 's made public higher taxes , uncontrolled immigration and uncertainty over trident would cause chaos for britain .", 
                "we just do n't know what else he would squeeze out of weak ed miliband .", 
                "scottish ministers have claimed that uk immigration policy is failing scotland , after data showed that nearly half of all migrants to scotland have been educated to degree level or higher .", 
                "analysis of the 2011 census shows that 49 % of the 369,000 immigrants who settled in scotland held a degree nearly twice the proportion of the population as a whole .", 
                "among migrants from within europe , the proportion was 60 % .", 
                "scottish labour leader jim murphy has pledged to set up a \u00e2\u00a3 175m anti-poverty fund in scotland using cash freed up by abolishing the bedroom tax in the uk .", 
                "murphy said the fund would be used to end reliance on food banks , which his party said had grown by 1,100 % in scotland due to welfare cuts ( see 6:06pm ) another ukip candidate , tim wilson , has quit the party in protest at unforgivable racist abuse from a senior mep .", 
                "this came shortly after ukip installed harriet yeo as its new general election candidate for folkestone and hythe following the expulsion of the previous candidate over allegations of an inflated expenses claim .",
