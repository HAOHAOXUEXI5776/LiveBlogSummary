                "mcdonnell , the shadow chancellor , hinted that shadow ministers who opposed the whip and voted against the article 50 bill yesterday may keep their jobs .", 
                "( see 9.22am . )", 
                "he suggested that labour may decide to abstain when mps vote on the bill 's third reading .", 
                "yesterday , at second reading , labour mps were whipped ( ie , ordered ) to vote in favour of the bill .", 
                "but nick robinson told mcdonnell that diane abbott , the shadow home secretary , has said the party will review its position on the bill if it fails to get any of its amendments accepted between now and the third reading .", 
                "asked what this meant , mcdonnell ruled out the party voting against the bill ( by saying the party would not oppose article 50 going through ) .", 
                "but he did not firmly commit the party to voting in favour again at third reading , suggesting that abstaining could be an option .", 
                "let 's be clear ; we have said we will no obstruct the passage of article 50 .", 
                "but what we are saying is this is just the first stage .", 
                "we will review what exactly happens on the day of the third reading .", 
                "that will be decided by the shadow cabinet .", 
                "he claimed that as the government implemented brexit , the tories would split and labour would unite .", 
                "and george osborne , the conservative former chancellor , could end up siding with labour on some issues , he said .", 
                "article 50 will go through .", 
                "and here 's the irony ; you will see the labour party after article 50 uniting , coming together , to really tackle and oppose the government in their imposition of what we think will be a reckless brexit .", 
                "the irony of it is that i think you 'll see the conservative party then splitting apart because , exactly as george osborne said [ in the debate yesterday ] , he disagrees , and a lot of others do , with the priorities that theresa may has set , particularly their undermining of our economy we are going to oppose what theresa may is trying to inflict on this country .", 
                "and we will have allies right the way across the house of commons .", 
                "and , by the sounds of it in the debate , george osborne himself he said that diane abbott missed the vote yesterday because she was ill. abbott was one of the shadow cabinet members known to be most unhappy about the decision to back article 50 , and there are sus that her illness was convenient .", 
                "asked about her absence , mcdonnell said : she was n't very well .", 
                "there was n't going to be a close vote .", 
                "if there was a close vote we would be bringing even sick people back .", 
                "but she was n't very well .", 
                "she was n't in attendance .", 
                "when it was put to him that she had brexit flu , he laughingly dismissed this , saying : we 've all been down with various bugs over the last few weeks .", 
                "he claimed the lib dems were just as split as labour over article 50 .", 
                "it 's not just us .", 
                "i know the focus on us .", 
                "the liberal democrats yesterday have only got nine mps , but two of them opposed their leader , so they split in exactly the proportion as us .", 
                "in one sense this is correct because 47 of the 229 labour mps ( 21 % ) defied the whip and voted against the bill , and two of the nine lib dem mps ( 22 % ) defied the whip and did not vote for the bill .", 
                "but the two lib dem rebels abstained , rather than voted against the bill , which is a less serious category of rebellion ."
