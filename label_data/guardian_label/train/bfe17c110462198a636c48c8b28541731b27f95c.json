                "but it appears to show that firms remain reluctant to boost spending while the outlook remains uncertain .", 
                "companies are continuing to demand a 12 % rate of return on investments , which is an average rate going back 100 years , and traditionally gave a return over interest rates of 7 % .now that interest rates are virtually zero , the headline rate of return remains 12 , giving them a 12 % return over interest rates .", 
                "this 5 percentage point gap indicates that firms are wary of the risks and demand a higher real return on their investments .", 
                "also , looking at the survey in more detail , two thirds of firms said they had invested appropriately since the financial crash and a third of firms said they had under-invested .", 
                "most of the under-investors blamed a lack of bank finance .",
