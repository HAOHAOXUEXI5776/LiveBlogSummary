                "i will be appointing ahead of the return of parliament to ensure that we have an effective shadow cabinet .", 
                "we are filling the positions , but we are not announcing anything this week .",

                "he said he would develop a team of the size that we need '' .",

                "i 'm open to the idea and i understand the argument behind it , but i also think the leader of the party must have the ability to form the general policy areas .", 
                "but , despite saying the party leader had to have some right to determine policy direction , he also reaffirmed his commitment to extending party democracy .", 
                "i think intrinsically , members need to have much more say in policy making for the longer term .", 
                "that means we have to engage much earlier on .",

                "sadiq khan 's speech may have been the most newsworthy of the morning , but the most enjoyable was paul flynn .", 
                "flynn , a leftwinger , has spent most of his career on the backbenches as a member of the awkward squad but he was appointed to the shadow cabinet in the summer when the resignations happened .", 
                "flynn doubles up as shadow welsh secretary and shadow leader of the commons .", 
                "his promotion was all the more remarkable because he is 81 .", 
                "flynn started with a joke about his age .", 
                "he was speaking as a grateful recipient of jeremy 's job creation scheme for geriatrics '' , he said .", 
                "but his speech , which he delivered in his capacity as shadow leader of the commons , contained some strong lines .", 
                "flynn appealed to the labour mps who resigned from the front bench to return .", 
                "he said he disagreed with len mccluskey , the unite general secretary , who gave a speech yesterday saying the merchants of doom '' should quit .", 
                "flynn said : len mccluskey made a speech for unity yesterday but there is one phrase in it - the one that he stole from shakespeare - that i must disagree with , because he did say 'some should depart the field ' .", 
                "no , no , no .", 
                "we 've got some of our best people sitting on the subs bench , you do n't score goals from the subs bench .", 
                "some resigned , they all did for honourable reasons .", 
                "it took courage for many of them to resign , it 's going to take greater courage for many of them to come back and we must make it possible for them to return with dignity and respect .", 
                "he said labour should abandon negativity .", 
                "in the last 12 months we 've been locked in a gap year of negativity , of pessimism , of hopelessness , by many in our party .", 
                "it seemed at times a competition to see who could be the most pessimistic about our future and our prospects - we 've got to end that .", 
                "it 's time to now to give unity a chance .", 
                "take all the bile and the hatred together , put it in a box , bury it deep underground , put six feet of concrete on top and then put a sign saying 'never should the last 12 months be unearthed from its dishonest grave ' .", 
                "flynn insisted that labour could win .", 
                "to back his point , he recalled helping out during the 1945 general election campaign with his brother .", 
                "he was only 10 at the time , but he remembers his mother telling him he was wasting his time .", 
                "she told him : look , boys , you are on the right side , it 's the labour party , it 's our party , but this candidate can not win because of prejudice .", 
                "you can not win in wales as a candidate if you 've got an irish name .", 
                "and no one called jim callaghan has any future in politics .", 
                "callaghan was elected mp for cardiff south in 1945 , and of course went on to become prime minister .", 
                "flynn claimed that labour had enjoyed marvellous results '' in elections over the last year .", 
                "the trouble with unity is that it is not sexy .", 
                "the media , the press , are not interested in it .", 
                "they are interested in rows , they are interested in division , they are interested in conflict .", 
                "but they do n't notice the brilliant year we 've had : magnificent election results .", 
                "instead of the polls , look at what happens when real people use real votes in real elections .", 
                "marvellous results in all the mayoral elections , in all the byelections .", 
                "in wales we gained three parliamentary seats that we lost a year ago .", 
                "flynn seems to be using the word brilliant '' rather loosely .", 
                "for a more accurate assessment of labour 's electoral record over the last year , read this uk polling report blog by anthony wells .", 
                "flynn mocked david cameron 's resignation honours list .", 
                "the daily mail , of all people , described his honours list as devalued , debased , discredited , egregious , grubby , tawdry , tainted , tarnished - otherwise alright .", 
                "he said britain needed root and branch reform of our democracy '' .", 
                "but reform needed to happen by cross-party agreement , he said .",
