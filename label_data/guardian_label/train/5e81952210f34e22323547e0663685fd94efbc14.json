                "they produced their figures by looking at mortality rates since 2010 , and comparing them with the mortality rates that might have been expected on the basis of the trends that applied before spending constraints '' kicked in .",

                "if these trends continue , even when considering the increased planned funding as of 2016 , we estimate approximately 150,000 additional deaths may arise between 2015 and 2020 .", 
                "combining these projected excess deaths and the observed deaths prior to 2015 translates to around 120,000 excess deaths from 2010 to 2017 .",

                "we have found that spending constraints since 2010 , especially pes , may have produced a substantial mortality gap in england .", 
                "our analyses demonstrate that if demand-side solutions are infeasible , large improvements in efficiency or , more feasibly , spending above growth in demand ( and not just general inflation ) are required to close this gap .", 
                "we suggest that spending should be targeted on improving care delivered in care homes and at home ; and maintaining or increasing nurse numbers .",
