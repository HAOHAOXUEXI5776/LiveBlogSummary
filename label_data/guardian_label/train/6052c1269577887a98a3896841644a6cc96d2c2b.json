                "but today 's speech was well-crafted and substantial , and could potentially have a decisive impact on uk brexit policy ( for reasons set out by , among others , andrew rawnsley here and matthew d'ancona here . )",

                "1 - corbyn has finally quashed the perception ( partly , but not entirely , fair ) that the labour and conservative approaches to brexit are largely indistinguishable by committing his party to staying in a customs union with the eu .", 
                "the key quote is at 11.09am and the parliamentary implications are considerable .", 
                "2 - but corbyn has also made it clear that customs union membership would be conditional on the uk retaining a say '' in eu trade deals .", 
                "he set this out clearly in the speech .", 
                "( see 11.11am . )", 
                "and he elaborated in the q & a , when he told journalists : what we want to achieve is our right to be able to negotiate and consult at the same time with the european union on the sort of trade agreements we make .", 
                "and also to influence them on the sort of trade deals that are made with the rest of the world does that mean we have to be passive takers ?", 
                "no .", 
                "we are a large economy , we are an important part of the world trade system and we will obviously negotiate to achieve that .", 
                "as the bbc 's laura kuenssberg points out , the labour plans get a bit hazy at this point as to what would happen if the eu were to say no .", 
                "laura kuenssberg ( @ bbclaurak ) our interview with corbyn - he says if eu said no a customs union where uk had a say , his plan b is to keep negotiating plan a for this reason the brexiter labour mp frank field thinks the customs union plan is a non-starter .", 
                "( see 12.39am . )", 
                "but other experts think the eu could agree to give the uk some sort of say ( see 10.38am ) and it is probably easier to imagine the eu complying with what corbyn wants than complying with what the government is demanding .", 
                "3 - corbyn genuinely seems to think that being in the single market would stop labour implementing some of its radical policies .", 
                "labour mps on the centre or right of the party who say the uk has to leave the single market tend to argue for this on the basis that staying in would mean accepting free movement .", 
                "by contrast , corbyn struck a relatively liberal note on immigration ( see 11.17am ) and instead argued in the speech that wholesale membership of the single market could obstruct labour policies .", 
                "( see 11.15am . )", 
                "he went further in the q & a , referring to eu rules covering state aid and competition .", 
                "the nationalisation of rbs , in order to accommodate european rules , was accompanied by the selling off of some of the best parts of rbs and the public was left with the remainder .", 
                "royal mail is a national monopoly , rail delivery is a natural monopoly .", 
                "i do not agree with or accept the idea there has to be competition in mail delivery .", 
                "after all , we all have one letter box , and it is much more efficient to have one postal delivery person coming down the street rather than three or four from different or competing companies .", 
                "likewise , the idea that you have competition in water supplies is a little odd when there is only one water pipe comes to each house .", 
                "so the idea that competition rules work for the benefit of all , we do not believe to be the case .", 
                "afterwards open britain , which is campaigning for a soft brexit , put out this statement from the labour mp pat mcfadden contesting corbyn 's claims .", 
                "mcfadden said : nor should we allow our position on the single market to be shaped by the view that it does n't allow state intervention .", 
                "that is not the case .", 
                "this old lexit tune fails to recognise the widespread state ownership of industry and the high welfare economies that exist inside the single market and inside the current eu .", 
                "4 - corbyn believes there will be a brexit dividend '' .", 
                "in his speech he said : labour will give the nhs the resources it needs , because we will raise tax on the top 5 % and big business , those with the broadest shoulders to pay .", 
                "not by making up numbers and parading them on the side of a bus .", 
                "and we will use funds returned from brussels after brexit to invest in our public services and the jobs of the future , not tax cuts for the richest .", 
                "this is contentious because many experts claim there will be no brexit dividend at all ( because the loss to the exchequer from the lower tax revenues generated as a result of brexit-induced lower growth will not compensate for the \u00a3 8bn-odd the uk saves not having to contribute to the eu budget . )", 
                "in short , brexit is likely to mean less money for public services , including the nhs , than otherwise would have been the case , '' the institute for fiscal studies said recently .", 
                "mcfadden also criticised this aspect of the speech .", 
                "he said : however labour needs to be honest with itself and honest with the electorate about this concept of a brexit public spending dividend which we have heard plenty of times from boris johnson and the leading brexiters .", 
                "the government 's own economic assessments leaked a couple of weeks ago show brexit to be a drag anchor on growth even after a reduction in payments to the eu is taken into account because the economic damage of leaving outweighs any budgetary gain .", 
                "if we really want to put jobs and the economy first we need to understand that .", 
                "reminder : mcfadden was sacked by corbyn as shadow europe minister two years ago .",

                "here is the key passage .", 
                "and many businesses have supply chains and production processes , interwoven throughout europe .", 
                "take the uk car industry , which supports 169,000 manufacturing jobs , 52,000 of which are here in the west midlands .", 
                "if we look at the example of one of britain 's most iconic brands in this sector , the mini , we begin to see how reliant our automotive industry is on a frictionless , interwoven supply chain .", 
                "a mini will cross the channel three times in a 2,000-mile journey before the finished car rolls off the production line .", 
                "starting in oxford it will be shipped to france to be fitted for key components before being brought back to bmw 's hams hall plant in warwickshire where it is drilled and milled into shape .", 
                "once this process is complete the mini will be sent to munich to be fitted with its engine , before ending its journey back at the mini plant in oxford for final assembly .", 
                "if that car is to be sold on the continent then many of its components will have crossed the channel four times .", 
                "actually , if corbyn 's account is correct , by my count the mini crosses the channel four times before completion .", 
                "whatever , it is a vivid illustration of how important supply chains are , and why having to comply with customs declarations and rules of origin paperwork could be crippling for the car industry .", 
                "government ministers do n't make this point in their speeches .", 
                "7 - corbyn does not see brexit as one of the great threats to humanity .", 
                "surprisingly for a speech focused on the mechanics of brexit , corbyn included a passage towards the end about the four greatest threats to humanity .", 
                "( see 11.24am . )", 
                "it was slightly incongruous , but it did make the point that corbyn is actually much more interested in human rights issues and global affairs than in what david cameron once describe as euro-wank '' .", 
                "the passage also included this swipe at theresa may - probably the rhetorical highlight of the speech .", 
                "many of us have friends and family that are from or who live in other parts of the world .", 
                "in contrast to the prime minister who said , if you believe you 're a citizen of the world , you 're a citizen of nowhere '' .", 
                "we believe in fact that we can only fully achieve what we want to as citizens of britain by also recognising we are citizens of the world '' .", 
                "8 - corbyn thinks the political class '' can not ignore the wider message of the eu referendum .", 
                "he made this point as he was wrapping up the q & a .", 
                "he said : let 's say to people , in every community , in every part of the country , a labour government will not let your industries disappear and be replaced by nothing other than short-term , insecure , zero-hours contract-type work .", 
                "we are serious , very serious , about investing in every community of the country .", 
                "surely the political class should learn a lesson from the results of the referendum , that sense of anger , anger , at left-behind communities anywhere in britain .", 
                "we will not walk by on the other side and let towns and cities die for the lack of investment .", 
                "it is our duty to achieve something very different and very better .", 
                "ironically ( in the light of point 7 ) this is a point on which he and may agree ; she said much the same in her speech to the conservative party conference in 2016 .", 
                "this also helps to explain why corbyn sounds so reluctant to have a second referendum on brexit .", 
                "( asked about this today , he did not rule it out , but he said it was not party policy . )",
