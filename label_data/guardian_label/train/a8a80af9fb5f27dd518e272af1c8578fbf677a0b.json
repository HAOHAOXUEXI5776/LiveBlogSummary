                "here are the key points from may 's statement .", 
                "may explained why she was winding up the current inquiry and setting up a new statutory inquiry .", 
                "she had previously said she would give the inquiry statutory powers , but had not specified how she would achieve this .", 
                "she considered three options : converting the current inquiry into a statutory one ; setting up a royal commission ; and setting up a new statutory inquiry .", 
                "having taken in-depth legal advice and having discussed the option with survivors , i have concluded a royal commission would not have the same robustness , in law , as a statutory inquiry .", 
                "in particular , it would not have the same clarity over its powers to compel witnesses to give evidence .", 
                "i have decided not to convert the current inquiry because doing so would not address the concerns of survivors about the degree of transparency in the original appointments process .", 
                "i have therefore decided upon the third option of establishing a new statutory inquiry with a panel .", 
                "she announced that justice lowell goddard , a new zealand judge , would chair the inquiry and she explained why .", 
                "justice goddard is a judge of the high court of new zealand and is a highly respected member of the judiciary who has been at the forefront of criminal law and procedure .", 
                "as chairman of the independent police complaints association of new zealand she conducted an inquiry into the policing of child abuse in new zealand and she is also a member of the united nations subcommittee on prevention of torture .", 
                "she will bring a wealth of expertise to the role of chairman and crucially she will be as removed as possible from the organisations and institutions that might become the focus of the inquiry .", 
                "may said the abuse uncovered so far was only the tip of the iceberg .", 
                "i have said before , and i shall say again , that what we have seen so far in rotherham , oxford , and greater manchester and elsewhere is only the tip of the iceberg .", 
                "this afternoon , my rt hon friend , the secretary of state for communities and local government will give a statement on louise casey 's report into rotherham borough council which will contain further evidence of their failure to protect vulnerable children .", 
                "with every passing day , every new revelation , it is clear that the sexual abuse of children has taken place and is still taking place on a scale that we still can not fully comprehend .", 
                "she said she was asking the current inquiry to produce a report on its work so far .", 
                "she said she hoped existing members of the inquiry panel would apply to be members of the new panel .", 
                "she said she would consider changing the inquiry 's terms of reference , so that it goes back beyond 1970 , but that there were good reasons for confining it to england and wales .", 
                "she said the official secrets act would not stop people giving evidence to the inquiry .", 
                "she said that she was now satisfied that child abuse was covered up in the past and that she was more determined than ever to expose this .", 
                "throughout those meetings [ may 's meetings with survivors ] , for every person who told their story , there was one common goal - to save others from the abuse they had suffered .", 
                "so let me be clear , i am now more determined than ever to expose the people behind these des crimes and the people and institutions that knew about abuse but did n't act , that failed to help when it was their duty - sometimes their very purpose - to do so , and the people and institutions that - in some cases - positively covered up evidence of abuse .", 
                "she said simon bailey , the national police lead for child protection , had been put in charge of ensuring all evidence about abuse presented to the inquiry gets followed up by the police .", 
                "i can confirm that there will be a co-ordinated national policing response that will link directly into the inquiry , and will be able to follow up any lead the inquiry uncovers this will be led by simon bailey , the national policing lead for child protection and abuse investigations as part of operation hydrant , which will co-ordinate all child abuse investigations concerning people of public prominence or those offences which took place in institutional settings .", 
                "the hydrant team will be responsible for the recording of all referrals from the inquiry that relate to potentially criminal abuse and failures to act .", 
                "it will also oversee the quality of responses from police forces to any requests for information from the panel .", 
                "she said more money was available for groups helping survivors .", 
                "in december , i announced a \u00e2\u00a3 2 million fund available to non-statutory organisations that had seen an increase in demand as a direct result of the announcement of the child abuse inquiry .", 
                "a further \u00e2\u00a3 2.85 million fund for non- statutory organisations providing support across england and wales was also announced .", 
                "i am pleased to announce that these funds are now available and organisations can now bid for them .", 
                "going forwards , further support will be needed for those who wish to give evidence to the inquiry and the many thousands of people who may be affected by its work .", 
                "it i expect appropriate government funding to be made available at the next spending review .", 
                "she said the cabinet office had identified a small number of files that should have been submitted to the wanless/whittam review into missing government documents covering abuse ."

                "chilcot said that , until he knew what evidence he could publish , he could not firm up the report 's conclusions , because he did not want to publish judgments without the evidence to back them up .",

                "as we went through , point by point with the current cabinet secretary , it became increasingly clear that , on the balance of argument , he would agree that a certain passage or point could be disclosed because of the essential nature of our inquiry , which related to the workings of our central government .", 
                "that came to the point where it was no longer possible to sustain a doctrine that these documents as a category could not be disclosed .",

                "robertson added : scotland needs and wants an alternative to austerity cuts , cancellation of the horrendously expensive trident renewal , the powers of real home rule , protection for our oil and gas industry , and a safeguard for our place in europe by ensuring that all four uk nations would have to vote for eu withdrawal before the uk could exit .",
