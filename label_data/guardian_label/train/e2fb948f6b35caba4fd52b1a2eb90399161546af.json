                "jeremy corbyn has claimed that the brexit vote showed the need for a new , interventionist approach to running the economy .", 
                "in one of the most detailed speeches he has given on the economy since becoming labour leader , he linked the vote in the eu referendum with his longstanding belief that neoliberal economics are failing by claiming that the leave vote was a decisive rejection of the status quo .", 
                "the current system meant poverty pay , zero-hours contracts and lives ruined by a shortage of affordable homes .", 
                "corbyn said that people could no longer rely on free trade and free markets alone to deliver prosperity .", 
                "our heavily-indebted societies are more vulnerable to financial shocks than they were .", 
                "all of this presents a deep challenge to the social democratic and socialist tradition that labour , new or old , has always been a part of .", 
                "it punctures the old belief that it was possible simply to redistribute the proceeds a growing economy to pay for public services .", 
                "it can no longer credibly be argued , for the majority of people , that free trade and free markets alone will deliver increased prosperity .", 
                "corbyn said that governments all over the world were becoming more interventionist and he said it was unpardonable folly for the tories to press ahead with cuts .", 
                "giving several examples of how this might happen , he said labour would focus on investment .", 
                "this would involve a new approach to enforcing free market rules , he went on , singling out eu state aid rules as a particular issue .", 
                "any deal with the eu must recognise that the old state aid rules are no longer valid .", 
                "when governments across the world are intervening , it makes no sense to tie a government 's hands here .", 
                "later , in response to a question , corbyn said that he was not saying britain should reject a trade deal with the eu after brexit if it involved accepting state aid rules ; he just wanted britain to be able to adopt a flexible approach to state aid , as germany , france and italy seem to be allowed to do , he said .", 
                "but he did say that under labour the government would insist on using british steel for infrastructure projects .", 
                "john mcdonnell has said the corbyn team has apologised for the release of the list of anti-corbyn mps .",

                "the exemption will last until 2019 , at which point a new funding model will ensure that the sector continues to be funded at current levels , he said .", 
                "supported accommodation is housing for vulnerable people with particular needs , like people with learning disabilities or addiction problems or women seeking refuge from domestic violence , and campaigners have been arguing for months that , without an exemption from the housing benefit cuts , many of these establishments could be forced to close .",
