                "david davis mok/pa pa has more on david davis ' warning over a row of the summer over about the eu 's determination to settle the irish border issue before discussions on trade .", 
                "the brexit secretary rejected brussels ' demands for the uk 's fee for exiting the bloc and the tricky issue of the irish border to be included in the first stage of talks .", 
                "and he insisted that the european court of justice ( ecj ) would not have a role in adjudicating disputes over the rights of eu citizens in the uk after brexit , setting up an early showdown in the negotiations .", 
                "on itv 's peston on sunday davis acknowledged there would be a row over the sequencing of the talks , with the uk insisting that discussions on a trade deal must feature at an early stage .", 
                "davis indicated he was optimistic that an early deal could be reached on citizens ' rights but said he took offence at the suggestion that uk courts could not rule on any disputes.there will be arguments over fine detail .", 
                "like whether the european court of justice oversees these rights after we have left , he said .", 
                "the uk was not prepared to accept the involvement of the ecj as we are going to be outside the reach of the luxembourg court after brexit .", 
                "davis also insisted it was wholly illogical for brussels to argue that progress must be made on agreeing the financial settlement and ireland before talks can progress to the uk 's future relationship - including the government 's desired trade deal .", 
                "indicating that there could be a legal dispute , davis said the position adopted by the eu and its chief negotiator michel barnier was based on a wrong interpretation of the treaty .", 
                "the position set out by brussels was aimed at ensuring the negotiating pressure is on us - that 's why it is designed this way with the most difficult bit , the funding and northern ireland established as hurdles to be crossed before trade talks can begin .", 
                "davis said : how on earth do you resolve the issue of the border with northern ireland and the republic of ireland unless you know what our general borders policy is , what the customs agreement is , what the free trade agreement is , whether you need to charge tariffs at the border or not ?", 
                "you ca n't decide one without the other .", 
                "negotiations on the structure of the talks will be the row of the summer , davis predicted .", 
                "while the preferred outcome was for a comprehensive trade deal taking in all products and all services , the uk had to retain the option of walking away if unacceptable conditions were on the table .", 
                "he said that in any negotiations you have to have the other option , the other alternative.rejecting as propaganda the terms hard and soft brexit , davis insisted that quitting the single market was what the public voted for in the 2016 referendum .", 
                "an increased tory majority was needed because in parliament there were a significant number of people who say they accept the referendum but actually try at every turn to tie the hands of the negotiators ."

                "jeremy corbyn has been on a journey since his opposition to nato and now accepts labour support for the military alliance , shadow foreign secretary emily thornberry has said .", 
                "the labour leader , who has said he would not automatically send uk troops to support a nato member which came under attack and has previously voices his opposition to the alliance , now accepted the will of the party that the transatlantic group was an essential part of the uk 's foreign policy , his shadow cabinet ally said .", 
                "thornberry said a labour government would be prepared to stand up to donald trump - but would not rescind the invitation for the us president to make a state visit to the uk later this year .", 
                "on bbc one 's andrew marr show , thornberry was challenged about a series of statements on foreign policy made by mr corbyn , including his opposition to nato and comments about the status of the falkland islands .", 
                "responding to 2011 footage of mr corbyn saying nato is a major problem and a danger to world peace , thornberry said : that 's a quote from six years ago and jeremy has been on a journey , to coin a phrase .", 
                "there have been a number of discussions .", 
                "it is quite clear that the predominance of opinion within the labour party is that we are committed to nato .", 
                "saying the labour manifesto would make clear the commitment to nato , she added : how would we get our forces off salisbury plain at the moment without the assistance of nato ?", 
                "we do n't have enough frigates to be able to move them onto the continent of europe if necessary if the russians were to come rolling over the hill .", 
                "asked to repudiate corbyn 's 2011 comments , she said : i 'm not fighting with anybody , i 'm telling you that the labour party 's position is a clear one .", 
                "she added that lots of politicians change their minds .", 
                "a government led by corbyn would only agree to military action on a multilateral basis which means the un security council , thornberry said - acknowledging that would potentially give russia and china a veto over any deployment of british troops .", 
                "it is very difficult , she acknowledged , but said the international agreement for action in kosovo showed that in some cases there were ways around the russian security council veto .", 
                "on the faklands , thornberry said labour would be prepared to send a taskforce in response to a crisis and there was no question of giving up sovereignty while the islanders wished to remain british.there needs to be a future in terms of talking to the neighbours of the falklands , she said , but certainly not undermining the sovereignty of the falkland islands .", 
                "she claimed the tories were gung-ho over the use of force , insisting you have to look at the alternatives first .",
