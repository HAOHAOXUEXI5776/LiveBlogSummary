                "among the many misdeeds by the police in modern times , tipping off the bbc about the raid on sir cliff richard 's home must be fairly near the bottom of the pile .", 
                "in fact , you could argue that the decision to help a legitimate news organisation cover a legitimate story was not really a mistake at all although most people who watched the coverage ( i was on holiday abroad at the time ) seem to think it reflected poorly on south yorkshire police .", 
                "still , did poor david crompton , the south yorkshire chief constable , really deserve such a mauling ?", 
                "it 's keith vaz 's job to hold officials like crompton to account , and he generally he does it brilliantly , but the danger of being quite so theatrical in a case like this ( see 5.26pm ) is that it leaves little scope for heightened outrage when a force does something really awful ( like , for example , allow 1,400 girls to be sexually exploited . )", 
                "now i 've got that off my chest , here are the main points keith vaz , chair of the commons home affairs committee , told david crompton , south yorkshire 's chief constable , that his force showed gross lack of competence '' in its dealings with the bbc over the raid on sir cliff richard 's home .", 
                "crompton said his view was that the force had been naive '' .", 
                "crompton offered a partial apology to richard .", 
                "we had a job to do but i do apologise to sir cliff if we were insensitive about the way that we did that .", 
                "we had a job to do , and we have an investigation .", 
                "the problem is that investigation could never be done in a low-profile way because it was fatally compromised from the outset .", 
                "crompton claimed that south yorkshire police had to give the bbc details of the raid because otherwise the bbc would have run a story about the invesgtigation , putting it in jeopardy .", 
                "he said : we were placed in a very difficult position because of the original leak and the bbc came to us knowing everything that we knew , as far as the investigation was concerned .", 
                "my concern was that if we showed the bbc the door , the very clear impression which had been left with my staff in the media department was that they were likely to publish the story .", 
                "that would have impeded our investigation .", 
                "i 'm confident that we made the right decision in difficult and unusual circumstances .", 
                "he said what he learnt about the media during the leveson inquiry influenced his decision not to ask bbc executives to hold back the story .", 
                "i did not really have that much faith that we could trust it would n't be published .", 
                "you only have to look at leveson to find a number of examples that were core to that particular inquiry where the media decided to publish anyway .", 
                "that was something very much in my mind .", 
                "lord hall , the bbc 's director general , said the bbc would not have run the story if the police had said it would damage their investigation .", 
                "if he had said to us , or others in the bbc news operation , that broadcasting this story would in any way have damaged this investigation we would not have run it .", 
                "vaz said the bbc acted perfectly properly '' in this affair .", 
                "the bbc revealed that south yorkshire police sent them an aerial photography of the block of flats containing richard 's home , to ensure they got the right property , before the raid happened .", 
                "this is not entirely consistent with what crompton said in a letter to the select committee last month when he said the police told the bbc about the broad location '' of the raid .", 
                "the bbc and crompton have given conflicting accounts of what the bbc 's reporter , dan johnson , told south yorkshire police about the source of his tip about richard being under investigation .", 
                "crompton said johnson said the information came from operation yewtree , run by the metropolitan police .", 
                "the bbc said johnson did not tell the police anything about his source .", 
                "crompton said 12 new victims had come forward to south yorkshire police since the publication of last week 's report into the rotherham abuse scandal .", 
                "the home affairs committee will take evidence from crompton on this in detail next week .", 
                "that 's all from me for today .", 
                "thanks for the comments ."
