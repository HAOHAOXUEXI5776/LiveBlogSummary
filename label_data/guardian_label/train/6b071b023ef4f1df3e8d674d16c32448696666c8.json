                "the ability to trade every minute and everywhere means that we have the opportunity to increase our links with those trading partners and markets who are functionally like us but not necessarily geographically close to us .", 
                "technological advances are dissolving away the barriers of time and distance .", 
                "i have often said that if francis fukuyama had called his book the end of geography rather than the end of history then he would have been more accurate about the world in which we now find ourselves .", 
                "i think the term globalisation could almost have been written with britain in mind .", 
                "it is an era where we have a tremendous opportunity to help shape the world around us for the benefit of all .", 
                "he said the government should help those at risk of losing out from globalisation by focusing on improving people 's skills .", 
                "he said isolationism and protectionism never end well .", 
                "he confirmed that britain could not negotiate trade deals while it remained a member of the eu .", 
                "while we remain inside the european union we are bound by its rules not to negotiate any new trade agreements , although we are able to discuss the impediments that we might wish to eliminate ahead of agreements we might reach with other countries when we leave .", 
                "it is worth pointing out that this is quite different from what david davis said in a conservativehome article in july about the brexit strategy .", 
                "writing shortly before he became brexit secretary davis said : so be under no doubt : we can do deals with our trading partners , and we can do them quickly .",

                "i would expect that the negotiation phase of most of them to be concluded within between 12 and 24 months .", 
                "so within two years , before the negotiation with the eu is likely to be complete , and therefore before anything material has changed , we can negotiate a free trade area massively larger than the eu .", 
                "trade deals with the us and china alone will give us a trade area almost twice the size of the eu , and of course we will also be seeking deals with hong kong , canada , australia , india , japan , the uae , indonesia and many others .",

                "philip hammond , the chancellor , has given a series of interviews this morning .", 
                "often at party conference it is the job of the chancellor , or shadow chancellor , to deliver the bad news .", 
                "this morning hammond duly obliged .", 
                "here are the key points .", 
                "hammond said the economy would go through a period of turbulence during the brexit negotiation process .", 
                "we must expect some turbulence as we go through this negotiating process .", 
                "there will be a period of a couple of years or perhaps even longer when businesses are uncertain about the final state of our relationship with the european union we have to expect a period when confidence will go up and down - perhaps on a bit of a rollercoaster - until we get to a final agreement , where businesses and consumers can understand what the future relationship between britain and the european union will be .", 
                "he said that , although the economy was doing well at the moment , there was a danger that business uncertainty would lead to investment drying up .", 
                "asked to rate the state of the economy on a scale of one to 10 , and when it was put to him that the uk might deserve a five or a six , he replied : oh , i think we are better than that .", 
                "from the data we 've seen from the first half of this year , this economy is running at eight out of 10 , with high employment , strong growth , robust fundamentals .", 
                "but he said that there was some evidence that trouble was looming .", 
                "anecdotally we hear of businesses postponing investment decisions .", 
                "and if we do n't do something , if we do n't intervene to counteract that effect , in time that would have an impact on jobs and growth .", 
                "and it is to make sure that we can intervene to deal with that situation that we need to push back the target for fiscal balance .", 
                "he said he was abandoning the plan to get the budget in surplus by 2019-20 because he had to be ready to spend more to support the economy during this period of uncertainty .", 
                "as we go into a period when inevitably there will be more uncertainty in the british economy , we need to have the space to be able to support the economy through that period .", 
                "but we need to do that within a context that makes very clear that we will balance that budget , we will get back to a position of fiscal sustainability .", 
                "there was a case for targeted , high-value investment in our economic infrastructure , he said .", 
                "he said investment in infrastructure would create jobs in the short term , and make britain more efficient in the long term .", 
                "he rejected claims that he was now adopting labour 's approach .", 
                "he claimed jeremy corbyn 's economic policies were ludicrous .", 
                "we 've heard some very irresponsible proposals from labour and we heard last week some ludicrous suggestions about borrowing vast amounts of money .", 
                "and we know from experience that the labour party , if it were ever entrusted with government , would not be spending this money on the most productive forms of investment .", 
                "when it was put to him that , although he might not be adopting corbyn 's policies , he was echoing what ed balls was saying before the general election , he also rejected that claim - although less convincingly .", 
                "told he sounded like balls , he replied : i hope i 'm sounding like a conservative pragmatist faced with a challenge of uncertainty in the economy , wanting to ensure that we support the british economy through that period .", 
                "he said the government was still accepted the assumption that brexit would lower growth .", 
                "asked about an institute for fiscal studies prediction that it would lower growth by 4 % , he replied : that is , despite the good economic data that we have had , still the central prediction of economic forecasters , that overall leaving the european union will have a negative effect on economic growth that 's the central prediction of economic forecasters and we have to take what they say seriously .", 
                "but the prediction did not involve a one-off hit to the economy , he said .", 
                "it was a forecast for what might happen over 15 years .", 
                "philip hammond and his wife susan williams-walker at the conservative conference .",
