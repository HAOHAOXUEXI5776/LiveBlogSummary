                "he claimed michel barnier , the eu 's chief brexit negotiator , and his team now accepted that the current framework for the talks - which prevents the transition and the future trade relationship being discussed until there has been progress on ireland , eu citizens ' rights and money - was flawed .", 
                "he said : we believe , and i think it is the case , that the eu 27 negotiating team also now believes , that the only way we will settle the so-called phase one issues is to set them in a broader context of the uk 's future relationship with the european union .", 
                "he said there should be at least exploratory discussions on transition arrangements and the future relationship now .",

                "he said uncertainty generated by brexit was damaging the economy .", 
                "i think it reflects the sense that , while the uk 's economy is fundamentally strong and in good shape , we are being affected by uncertainty around the negotiation process that we are engaged in .",
