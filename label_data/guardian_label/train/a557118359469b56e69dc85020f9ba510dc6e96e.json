                "it may end up that interest rates of 1-2 per cent become the norm rather than the exception .", 
                "with inflation low and likely to remain low , the reserve bank can attempt to run the economy at a faster rate by cutting interest rates .", 
                "the aim is to boost spending , employment and investment with the stronger demand lifting the inflation rate back into the 2-3 % target band .", 
                "but there are no guarantees that lower rates will indeed boost economic growth and inflation .", 
                "that does n't mean that you give up trying .", 
                "central banks need to do everything in their power to stimulate growth and prevent super-low inflation rates being sustained .", 
                "and certainly do everything to prevent deflation ( falling prices ) from taking hold .",
