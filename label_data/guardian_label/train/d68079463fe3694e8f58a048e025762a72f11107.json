                "or b ) simply that the ice sheets moved at this time breaking the usable cores ?",

                "in general greenland is much closer to the equator than antarctica , and is more sensitive to warming air temperatures , so we think that during extended warm periods it would be a much smaller ice sheet and not extend to the coast like it currently does .", 
                "when you drill an ice core , because of the way the ice had flowed over tens of thousands of years , the layers of ice that fell in any year get thinner and thinner , making it much more difficult to date the bottom of an ice core .", 
                "in addition , the ice slowly moves so it can get folded up ( think of the patterns your can see in rocks in road cuttings ) , and this disturbance in the ice at the bottom can make it very hard to use the very bottom of an ice core .", 
                "another factor for greenland is that it is much smaller than antarctica , so it just takes less time for the flowing ice to move to the edge and be lost to the ocean .", 
                "so the ice gets replaced over much shorter timescales than in antarctica .", 
                "the geothermal energy question is good .",
