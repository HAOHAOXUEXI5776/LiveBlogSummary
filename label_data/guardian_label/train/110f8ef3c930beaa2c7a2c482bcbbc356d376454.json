                "malcolm turnbull the member for wentworth bounded out of his canberra house early , noted that there was a big job to do , a job he had n't expected , but he indicated he was more than up to it just in case there were any doubts .",

                "the measured departure pace of the man he vanquished as party leader on monday night meant turnbull had to be sworn in at government house at warp speed , get back to question time , hammer down a coalition deal with the nationals , reassure every conservative member of the coalition that he would not break out on day one on climate change , same sex marriage , or anything else remotely progressive sounding ; while reassuring the voters that ( unlike some ) he was not in any shape of form afraid of the future .",

                "at least alan jones mourned with appropriate devotion .", 
                "when abbott surfaced , it was to list his achievements , tell colleagues he would not be doing unto others what had been wrongfully done unto him , tell the media they were in the gratuitous assassination business , tell no-one in particular that his chief of staff peta credlin had been much maligned by people who should have known better .", 
                "then he left .", 
                "he skipped question time , a gesture of respect to the new king , or a sensible act of self preservation for a human being who would have been to hell and back in the space of 24 hours .", 
                "bill shorten the labor leader pretended everything was ok , and business as usual , even though this is absolutely his worst case scenario .",
