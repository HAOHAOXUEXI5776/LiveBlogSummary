            "text": [
                "here are the key points from david davis 's evidence to the brexit committee .", 
                "davis , the brexit secretary , said the government would not publish the brexit plan it promised last week until february at the earliest .", 
                "asked when it would come , he said : it wo n't be next month .", 
                "the policy work is still underway ; there are quite a few decisions still to be made .", 
                "we 've carried out or are in the midst of carrying out about 57 , i think , sectoral analyses , each of which has implications for individual parts of 85 % of the economy , and some of those are still to be concluded ; we have work still to be done on justice and home affairs , so there is a fair number of things still to do .", 
                "so it will be as soon as we 're ready .", 
                "he said that he would back a transitional deal , provided it was about implementation '' .", 
                "davis and others have said brexit could involve two forms of transitional deal : an implementation deal , that would bridge the gap between the end of the two-year brexit talks and the start of a final new trade arrangement ; or a transition period to extend the exit talks following the failure to agree a final deal in two years .", 
                "davis said he could see the case for the first sort of deal .", 
                "whatever the transitional arrangement is , we need to know where we 're going before we decide on the transition .", 
                "if you build a bridge , you need to have both sides established before you build the bridge .", 
                "so we need to know where we 're going ; it seems to me perfectly possible to know what the end game will be within two years .", 
                "when pressed on whether he would agree to a transitional deal , he said : an implementation phase ?", 
                "if it is necessary and only if it is necessary . ''", 
                "on monday , in evidence to the commons treasury committee , philip hammond , the chancellor , said there should be a transitional deal .", 
                "but , unlike davis , hammond hinted that he would favour a transitional deal even if it were only a 'creating extra time ' one .", 
                "davis raised the possibility of article 50 ( the process that starts the two-year withdrawal process ) being revoked .", 
                "he stressed that he did not see this as at all likely , but he did not say it was impossible .", 
                "he said : it is very , very difficult to see [ article 50 ] being revoked .", 
                "we do n't intend to revoke it , and it may not be revocable , i do n't know .", 
                "this is significant because until now the government has insisted that article 50 can not be revoked , even though many experts , including the person who drafted it , say it could be revoked if eu leaders decided that is what they wanted .", 
                "the situation is ambiguous because article 50 was never expected to be used , and so it is silent on the subject of whether or not it can be reversed .", 
                "davis said he thought it was possible to conclude the entire brexit talks , covering withdrawal and a new trade relationship , within a year and a half .", 
                "( officially two years is available , but in practice the commission has said the talks will have to be concluded within 18 months , to allow time for ratification . )", 
                "he said the public wanted this done quickly .", 
                "the british people want this done with some degree of expedition , they want it done properly and soon and that is what we are trying to do .", 
                "michel barnier , the european commission 's brexit negotiator , has said that he thinks the uk has to negotiate eu withdrawal before it negotiates its new trade arrangement with the eu , not in parallel as davis wants .", 
                "davis suggested that details of britain 's new immigration rules might not be decided until after brexit .", 
                "the talks would just focus on ensuring britain gets control of immigration , he said .", 
                "how immigration rules would then work would not be part of the negotiation , he suggested .", 
                "he refused to say whether the government 's brexit plan '' , when published , would take the form of a white paper .", 
                "and he refused to say how long it would be , or whether it was more likely to cover just two pages , or run to about 40 .", 
                "he said he had to decide on the content first .", 
                "he would only publish information that would not undermine the government 's negotiating position .", 
                "he refused to commit the government to giving mps a vote on the brexit plan .", 
                "he said the government was determined to keep the border between northern ireland and ireland open and that norway/sweden might provide a model for how this could be done .", 
                "there is an example of how that might be done that the committee might look at , the norway/sweden border .", 
                "they are both in the single market but they straddle the customs union .", 
                "and it 's a very open border , with particular arrangements designed to make the border a free border .", 
                "davis said he was optimistic that the eu would be helpful on this point .", 
                "barnier raised it with him when they met , he said .", 
                "he also dismissed the idea that not having border controls at the northern ireland/ireland border could allow people to evade uk border controls .", 
                "there are 50m people land at british airports every year .", 
                "it is a very long-winded way to get into the uk to come via dublin .", 
                "instead , he hinted that a solution might involve the irish beefing up their own security .", 
                "i also went to dublin .", 
                "they were equally keen to maintain this , and we may well have discussions with them at some point about their own incoming security , so that we 've got some watchlist-type thing there .", 
                "but that 's for them to decide , not me .", 
                "he said the government was looking at four possible options for the uk 's relationship with the customs union .", 
                "they were : being fully in ; fully out ; a partially inside turkish model of being inside the customs union but outside the single market ; and a swiss model of being outside the customs union but with customs arrangements .", 
                "he confirmed that , if britain had a trade deal with the eu , it would have to follow the decisions of an external arbitration body .", 
                "hilary benn , the committee chairman , suggested this undermined leave claims that leaving was about taking back control .", 
                "but davis said a trade arbitration body would only cover trade , unlike the european court of justice .", 
                "he said that in future he might brief the brexit committee in private on the government 's plans .", 
                "he said that he expected his department to be wound up within two and a half years .", 
                "that 's all from me for today .", 
                "thanks for the comments ."
