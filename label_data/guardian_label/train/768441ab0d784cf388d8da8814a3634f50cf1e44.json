                "here are five things we learned from the interview .", 
                "1 - may has discovered housing as an issue .", 
                "in the interview , she said she realised during the election campaign that the prospect of young people not being able to buy a house was a big issue .", 
                "she said the same thing in her sun interview .", 
                "this insight is not particularly remarkable , but what makes it surprising is that may has just announced a queen 's speech that contained very little on housing ( there was a reference to building more homes , but the only housing-related legislation was a draft tenants ' fees bill ) .", 
                "her disclosure shows there is quite a gap between her analysis of what the country needs , and what her government is actually offering .", 
                "2 - may seems to think growth is the solution to her government 's financial problems .", 
                "barnett asked where the \u00a3 1bn was coming from for the deal with the dup .", 
                "it could only come from three areas , she said : higher taxes , more borrowing , or spending cuts .", 
                "but may , who until now has not explained how the government will fund the extra \u00a3 1bn for northern ireland , said there was a fourth option .", 
                "actually , there is somewhere else that money comes from .", 
                "and that 's what we have already shown ; just look at our record on things like the extra money we 've put into the health service .", 
                "we 've been able to do that as the economy has grown .", 
                "if the economy grows , and you are creating that wealth , more money is coming into the government 's coffers , that enables you to ensure that you have got that money to spend .", 
                "the problem with this , of course , is that growth is slowing in the uk .", 
                "3 - may seems to have reservations about calling herself a feminist .", 
                "when barnett asked her if she was a feminist , she did not reply with a straight yes .", 
                "instead she paused for a moment and replied : i have said yes before , yes , i 've said that i 'm a feminist , in that i believe that it 's important that women genuinely have equal opportunities .",

                "she dodged the main thrust of that question , but said she admired how he responded as a constituency mp to the finsbury park attack .", 
                "5 - she is not 100 % maybot .", 
                "my colleague john crace had the equivalent of a sketchwriting scoop when he coined the term maybot to describe the prime minister .", 
                "it is such an apt description of her inability to engage emotionally that everyone is now using it .", 
                "but today , mostly when she spoke about the election result , she did sound more human and engaging than usual .", 
                "she admitted that she shed a little tear '' over the result , and she revealed that she did not listen to the exit poll on tv because she has a little bit of superstition about things like that '' .",

                "this is the statement that sir keir starmer , the shadow brexit secretary , put out overnight announcing that labour will vote against the repeal bill at second reading unless there are significant changes to it .", 
                "he said : labour has always been clear that brexit can not lead to any rolling back of rights and protections .", 
                "we need effective legislation that protects british workers and consumers , enshrines equality laws , enforces environmental standards and devolves powers across the country .", 
                "the government 's repeal bill falls short on all counts .", 
                "it is simply not fit for purpose .", 
                "the bill proposes sweeping new powers for ministers that are fundamentally undemocratic , unaccountable and unacceptable .", 
                "it fails to guarantee crucial rights will be enforced ; it omits the eu charter of fundamental rights and it does nothing to ensure that british standards and rights keep pace with our eu partners .", 
                "labour are putting the prime minister on notice that unless the bill is significantly improved in all these areas , labour will vote it down in the house of commons .", 
                "and here are the six concerns that labour has with the bill .", 
                "i 'm quoting from a labour briefing note .", 
                "1 - it proposes sweeping delegated powers but lacks effective oversight or accountability .", 
                "in particular , the bill could allow delegated powers to be used very late in negotiations to cover significant policy changes .", 
                "this is fundamentally undemocratic and unacceptable .", 
                "2 - it lacks clear enforcement mechanisms .", 
                "without remedies , key rights such as workplace rights or environmental standards could become unenforceable .", 
                "3 - it does not include the eu charter of fundamental rights .", 
                "this codifies human rights in eu law and uk law in modern form and includes important protections in evolving areas such as privacy protections , discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation and rights for the elderly .", 
                "failure to include the charter will impact the way that rights are interpreted in uk courts .", 
                "4 - it takes the wrong approach on devolution and does not ensure effective involvement of devolved administrations .", 
                "there should be a clear presumption of devolution .", 
                "without this , the bill is a significant power grab for whitehall and fails to capitalise on the potential for further devolution of power .", 
                "5 - it does not include any provision to ensure that uk rights keep pace with eu rights after brexit .", 
                "this could lead to uk rights lagging behind the eu over time in areas such as workplace , consumer or equality protections or environmental standards .", 
                "6 - there can be no qualifications , limitations or sunset clauses attached to this bill .", 
                "if there are , labour will not support it .", 
                "in addition , labour will block the use of delegated legislation to the same effect .", 
                "starmer is fond of imposing brexit tests .", 
                "in december last year he set out five tests that labour would use to determine whether it could support the government 's brexit plan .", 
                "and in march he set out six tests the party would use to judge the final brexit deal .",
