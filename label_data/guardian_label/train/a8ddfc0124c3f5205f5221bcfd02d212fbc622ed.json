            "text": [
                "what jeremy corbyn has said today about executive pay has completely overshadowed , in terms of press coverage , what he had to say about brexit .", 
                "but the passages in the speech on brexit are worth reading .", 
                "they go beyond - or , in one case , clarify - what was briefed overnight and they shed new light on corbyn 's brexit thinking .", 
                "here are five things we 've learnt .", 
                "1 - corbyn seems set to block any move to legislate for a second referendum on the eu .", 
                "he has never backed the idea , but some labour mps would like to amend any legislation that might have to be passed to allow the government to trigger article 50 to include a referendum on the final brexit deal .", 
                "today corbyn made it clear that he is opposed , arguing that owen smith 's defeat in the labour leadership contest ( smith backed a second referendum ) amounted to a labour vote against the idea .", 
                "( see 3.37pm . )", 
                "2 - he is redefining the eu referendum vote as a vote for higher nhs funding .", 
                "( see 3.41pm . )", 
                "this is not a conventional reading of what the referendum vote meant , but it is at least arguable and it suits labour , because it allows corbyn to claim the referendum as a mandate for a labour proposal to spend more on the nhs .", 
                "3 - he seems to be rejecting claims that brexit will lead to the government losing revenue .", 
                "during the referendum campaign vote leave claimed not having to pay contributions to the eu would save the government \u00a3 350m a week .", 
                "the \u00a3 350m a week figure was widely discredited , and bodies like the institute for fiscal studies said that , even though brexit would save the government billions in eu contributions , this would not make up for the lost revenue caused by lost tax receipts caused by brexit-related lower growth .", 
                "but corbyn argued that there would be a net benefit that could go to the nhs .", 
                "( see 3.42pm . )", 
                "he is siding more with vote leave than with the ifs .", 
                "4 - he signalled that he wants to use state aid powers currently illegal under eu rules .", 
                "( see 3.44pm . )", 
                "he also said that he wanted good access to the single market , but the passage on state aid suggests that corbyn thinks that having to leave the single market would be a price worth paying for being able to use state aid mechanisms that are banned under single market rules .", 
                "5 - he did shift labour 's stance on freedom of movement , but only from being absolutely in favour to being neutral .", 
                "he made it clear that he is not shifting it from for to against .", 
                "( see 3.47pm . )", 
                "that 's all from me for tonight .", 
                "thanks for the comments ."

                "jeremy corbyn announced plans to curb excessive pay - but he appeared to drop a proposal to legislate for a maximum salary cap that he endorsed on the today programme this morning .", 
                "in his speech he said there were four policy options that might help to reduce income inequality that labour would consult on .", 
                "but , when he listed them , he did not include a maximum salary cap and , when pressed , he said that what he was concerned about was the pay ratio , not maximum pay per se .", 
                "( see 4.21pm . )", 
                "corbyn hinted that he might favour a new tax for high earners .", 
                "he has already said that labour would reintroduce the 50p top rate of tax abolished by george osborne in the last parliament , a rate that applied to people earning more than \u00a3 150,000 .", 
                "that equated to about 1 % of the population .", 
                "in his speech corbyn identified higher tax as one of the four options labour would consult on .", 
                "he said : we could ensure higher earners pay their fair share by introducing a higher rate of income tax on the highest 5 % or 1 % of incomes .", 
                "in a briefing note on this labour said : this proposal will make the income tax system significantly more progressive , by making sure those on higher incomes pay a fair share of tax .", 
                "corbyn said labour would stop firms with pay ratios of more than 20:1 getting government contracts .", 
                "he said : another advocate of pay ratios was david camero .", 
                "his government proposed a 20:1 pay ratio to limit sky-high pay in the public sector and now all salaries higher than \u00a3 150,000 must be signed off by the cabinet office .", 
                "labour will go further and extend that to any company that is awarded a government contract .", 
                "what corbyn said about cameron was misleading .", 
                "cameron commissioned will hutton to conduct a review of pay in the public sector and the interim report proposed a 20:1 pay ratio ( highest pay to lowest pay ) .", 
                "but in the final report hutton rejected the idea .", 
                "corbyn suggested using kitemarks to incentivise firms to control pay .", 
                "this was another of the four options labour will consult on .", 
                "he said : we could allow consumers to judge for themselves with a government-backed kitemark for those companies that have agreed pay ratios between the pay of the highest and lowest earners with a recognised trade union .", 
                "in a briefing note on this labour said : publication of directors ' pay was originally intended to shame companies into pay moderation , but it has had the opposite effect by encouraging companies to compete with each other on pay .", 
                "instead , this proposal would accredit companies that met certain standards , particularly pay ratios , thus allowing consumers to punish non-compliant firms .", 
                "he suggested forcing high-earning executives to get their pay approved by remuneration committees containing a majority of emploees .", 
                "this was another of the four options .", 
                "he said : we could ask for executive pay to be signed off by remuneration committees on which workers have a majority .", 
                "in a briefing note labour said : remuneration committees currently consist of non-executive directors who are advised by pay consultancies .", 
                "too often these form a close knit group in which limited scrutiny is carried out .", 
                "the use of benchmarking by consultants making pay recommendations , whereby an executive 's pay is compared with their peers , further limits the extent to which excessive pay is challenged .", 
                "the government green paper on corporate governance includes putting workers on remuneration committees as one option among many .", 
                "giving workers a majority would ensure that workers ' had real voice in pay decisions , and that their representation was more than symbolic .",
