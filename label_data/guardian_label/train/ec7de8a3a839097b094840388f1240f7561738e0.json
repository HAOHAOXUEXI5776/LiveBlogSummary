                "key findings include : blair deliberately exaggerated the threat posed by saddam hussein ; the uk chose invasion before it had exhausted peaceful options ; british intelligence produced flawed information ; the us ignored uk advice on postwar planning ; the british military was poorly prepared for war , blair ignored warnings , kept his cabinet in the dark and had no plans for occupation .", 
                "the report revealed secret letters between blair and george w bush , including one in which the then prime minister pledged to the us president : i will be with you , whatever .", 
                "six days after invasion , he added : this is the moment when you can define international politics for the next generation : the true post-cold war world order .",

                "despite the intelligence failures and other mistakes he has acknowledged previously , a spokesperson said , president bush continues to believe the whole world is better off without saddam hussein in power .", 
                "blair rejected at least nine findings of the report , including that war was not a last resort , that the uk and us undermined the un , that an insurgency was predictable and that the military and intelligence services share some blame .",

                "he apologised to iraqis , british soldiers and to the millions of british citizens who feel our democracy was traduced and undermined by the way in which the decision to go to war was taken .", 
                "reg keys called blair 's statement the ramblings of a madman , saying the former prime minister misled parliament and that his son and other soldiers died in vain .", 
                "lord butler and others made limited defenses of blair , with many saying that he exagerrated the reliability of intelligence but acted in good faith and did not lie .", 
                "the us diplomat in charge of the occupation in 2003 agreed with several key findings but also argued that the decision to invade was justified .", 
                "many iraqis met the report with the grim sense that it only articulated the obvious : that western hubris and incompetence had created the conditions for years more of strife , including sunday 's bombing , which killed an estimated 250 people in one of the worst atrocities of postwar iraq .",
