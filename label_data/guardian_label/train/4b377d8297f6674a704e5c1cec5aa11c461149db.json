            "text": [
                "snap verdict : what was remarkable about david cameron 's speech was what was not in it .", 
                "over the last few weeks there have been speculation about cameron demanding quotas for eu migrants , or perhaps the use of the emergency brake procedure to keep eu migrants out ( an idea sir john major proposed ) , but , from what he said today , there was not the slightest hint that these ideas have even been on the agenda .", 
                "the speech was measured , rather than confrontational , and even his line about ruling nothing out in the event of not getting his way ( see 10.33am ) was different in tone from today 's telegraph splash headline , i 'm ready to lead britain out of europe if migrant reforms fail .", 
                "the speech was also notable for the long passage at the start stressing the contribution that immigrants have made to britain .", 
                "we are great britain because of immigration , not in spite of it , he said .", 
                "although his proposals to ban eu migrants from getting in-work benefits for four years sound drastic , they are not dramatically different from ideas that have already been floated by labour and the lib dems and it is well short of what the sun has been demanding in its draw a red line on immigration or else campaign .", 
                "the sun has reported on the speech relatively neutrally this morning , as if it has not yet decided whether to commend cameron for adopting its policy ( which he has n't ) , or lambast him for being feeble .", 
                "it 's also worth pointing out how cameron 's plans for the eu renegotation have changed .", 
                "in an article in the sunday telegraph in march , he highlighted seven priorities , only two of which related to immigration .", 
                "now the renegotation seems to be entirely about immigration .", 
                "has cameron got much chance of getting what he wants from the eu ?", 
                "it is too early to know for sure , but it does not seem impossible .", 
                "but will this counter the threat from ukip ?", 
                "faced with a threat from populist insurgents , political scientists argue that mainstream parties have three options : hold ( fight what the insurgents are saying ) ; defuse ( remove the problem fuelling insurgent support ) ; or adopt ( copy their ideas wholesale ) .", 
                "cameron 's speech is mostly in the defuse territory , although there was a splash of hold at the start of the speech .", 
                "it is certainly a considered , serious response , but ukip 's rise is not simply driven by migration and , even if it were , as sir gerald howarth said earlier ( see 9.13am ) , people want action now .", 
                "do n't expect ukip 's poll ratings to fall anytime soon ."
