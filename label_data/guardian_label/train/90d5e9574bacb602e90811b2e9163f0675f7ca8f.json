                "having been denounced by house speaker paul ryan , mccain , esteemed members of the military and chided even by his running mate , trump has refused to back down from controversial comments directed at the family of cpt humayun khan .", 
                "instead , trump appears to be attempting to divert attention from khan 's family by labelling rival hillary clinton the devil , praising ryan 's primary opponent and suggesting that women who are sexually harassed at work simply find new jobs .",
