                "it usually takes months for the high court to hand down a decision , but the result in this case has been expedited due , rather ironically given one of the main questions of law at play , to urgency .", 
                "the australian statistician david kalisch has given an undertaking to the court that abs will not start the voluntary postal survey until midnight on 11 september , which gives the government five days to scramble if the high court rules the survey itself , or the mechanism used to fund it , invalid .", 
                "conversely , if the court finds against the plaintiffs , marriage equality campaigners will have five days to ramp up their campaign activities in order to try to secure a \u0080\u0098yes ' majority .", 
                "as paul karp has reported , tiernan brady , director of the equality campaign , expects most people will return their postal survey form within the first 72 hours .", 
                "what we can expect when the court returns at 2.15pm tomorrow is an answer to each of the questions contained in the special case document , which ask : do the plaintiffs have standing to appear in this matter ?", 
                "was finance minister mathias cormann 's direction for an additional $ 122m to fund the survey valid under s.10 of the appropriations act ?", 
                "was that expenditure within the definition of ordinary annual services of government , as set out in the constitution , and is that question justiciable ?", 
                "is asking the abs to do this survey under the ordinary annual services of the abs ?", 
                "if the answer to questions two , three , or four is \u0080\u0098yes ' , what should be done ?", 
                "as relief , the plaintiffs are seeking injunctions to stop the survey .", 
                "who should pay costs ?", 
                "solicitor general stephen donaghue told the court he only required an answer to question five , which , as the court pointed out , is kind of cheating because answering question 5 will require the previous four to have been answered .", 
                "there is no indication of which way the court will go , but the plaintiffs only need to have convinced four of the seven judges of one of their arguments in order for the postal survey to be deemed invalid .", 
                "on the other hand , donaghue only needs four of the seven to agree with his argument that the plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge this matter in the high court and the whole case will be thrown out in the government 's favour .", 
                "it does however appear unlikely that donaghue 's claim the survey will go ahead if only the funding is deemed invalid , and not the survey itself , will prove true .", 
                "if they are successful on any count , kate richardson , counsel for australian marriage equality said , the relief they will seek is an injunction to stop the survey .",

                "donaghue will also argue that because the challenge is basically one of administrative law against a direction issued under the appropriations act , it must take into account the special nature of appropriations themselves , which he will argue are a ) difficult for a private person to challenge because they do not confer rights or privileges nor impose duties or obligations ; and b ) matters in which the court has a limited role .",
