                "here is a full summary of the main points from nick clegg 's phone-in clegg accused theresa may , the home secretary , making an outrageous '' and appalling '' false claim about the lib dems in her party conference speech and said that coalition relations had hit a new low point '' as a result .", 
                "he said that he had sent her a very strong letter demanding an apology .", 
                "in her speech may claimed that lib dem opposition to the so-called snooper 's charter was putting lives at risk .", 
                "the lib dems rejected this claim on the day , but clegg went much further today .", 
                "asked about may 's speech , he said : i thought it was one of the most misleading and outrageous platform speeches i 've heard in conference seasons for a very long time absolutely appalling .", 
                "this is a new low point in coalition relations .", 
                "may talked about the national crime agency having to drop cases they were going to take to court .", 
                "but , clegg said , the facts were quite difference .", 
                "the nca dropped the cases because it could not link ip addresses to mobile devices .", 
                "he said he had been urging the home office to address this for months .", 
                "and guess who has been dragging their feet to deal with it ?", 
                "the home office .", 
                "i think i 'm entitled to be a little bit aggrieved to hear a conservative home secretary somehow claim that my party is putting children at risk when it is their inactivity which is doing just that .", 
                "he said that he had written may letter demanding an apology .", 
                "asked it it was very strong '' , he said it was .", 
                "i have made it very , very clear to her that i expect an apology from her for making such a false and outrageous claim to say about another politician , particularly someone you are governing with , that you are putting children at risk , when it 's not true , is a level of outrageous misinformation that i have not witnessed in the four and a half years i 've been in this government .", 
                "he said that under the tories the working poor would get poorer and public services would be absolutely decimated '' .", 
                "i think [ david cameron 's ] was a cynical speech because one thing we know form the conservative party conference now is two things .", 
                "we know now two things for absolutely sure , which is that if the conservatives were ever to become a majority government , and god help us if there 's either a labour or tory-only government in this country after 2015 .", 
                "if there were , two things would happen .", 
                "the working poor would become poorer .", 
                "with almost undisguised relish george osborne announced in his speech that they would not ask very wealthy people to pay a single extra penny in tax any unfunded giveaway , which we heard from david cameron , has to be paid for and the conservative answer is the only people who pay , the only section of the population they would is the working age poor .", 
                "and the second thing we now know is that public services , like social care , the police , other things that people really rely on , will be absolutely decimated and cut to the bone because they refuse to ask anyone on much , much higher incomes to make any contribution as he completes the job of filling the black hole in the public finances .", 
                "he suggested that it was hypocritical for david cameron to back raising the basic income tax threshold to \u00a3 12,500 when in the past he has resisted this idea in coalition .", 
                "it is not what they have been saying for the last four and a half years .", 
                "every time danny alexander and i said , 'look , we 've got to raise the tax allowance ' , david cameron and george osborn both would say , 'nick , this is your tax break , why do you want this tax break , you 're going to have to give some other concessions ' .", 
                "if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery , then we 're making progress .", 
                "he said the unfunded tax cuts proposed by the conservatives would backfire on them in due course .", 
                "i really think it is going to unravel big time over the next seven months .", 
                "i have seen this before in politics .", 
                "things that are praised to the rafters are often precisely the commitments that then unravel the most later .", 
                "( a good example would be gordon brown 's decision to abolish the 10p starting rate of tax .", 
                "can you think of any others ? )", 
                "he said labour had no new ideas and the conservatives had no new ideas of their own .", 
                "i 've been watching the labour and conservative party conferences , or as much as i can bear , and the that is emerging , you 've got one party , the labour party , with no new ideas and another party with no new ideas of their own .",
