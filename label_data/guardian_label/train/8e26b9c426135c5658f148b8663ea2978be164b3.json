                "sir john chilcot has told mps that tony blair 's sheer psychological dominance '' played a key role in the run-up to the iraq war , and meant that flawed evidence justifying the 2003 invasion was never challenged .", 
                "labour has announced that it is organising special screening of ken loach 's film i , daniel blake ahead of the autumn statement as part of a campaign to get the government to reverse cuts to employment and support allowance , a disability benefit .", 
                "john mcdonnell , the shadow chancellor , said : in the run up to the autumn statement labour will be pushing the chancellor , philip hammond , to scrap these cruel esa cuts to sick and disabled people .", 
                "i , daniel blake was one of the most moving films i 've ever seen so i 'm very pleased we have teamed up with ken loach to urge people to go and watch it at these special screenings taking place before the autumn statement .", 
                "we 're living in an i , daniel blake society as a result of having the tories in power for six years .", 
                "the government should be caring for sick and disabled people , not making their lives worse .", 
                "sir michael wilshaw , the ofsted chief inspector , has described england 's education system as like its football team - better than many , but hardly top notch '' .", 
                "in a speech he said : for the most part , england 's education system is a bit like its football team - better than many , but hardly top notch .", 
                "we comfort ourselves with past success , illusory as that might be , dream of future glory , then collapse into despair when we come across superior play .", 
                "this familiar tale of disappointment , however , is misleading in two important respects .", 
                "firstly , it fails to recognise that our education system has come from a long way back .", 
                "twenty years ago , standards were truly dire across the phases , and generations of children were being let down year after year .",

                "secondly , it can tempt us to adopt fanciful and nostalgic solutions while our very real structural problems are ignored .", 
                "drivers of polluting diesel vehicles could soon be charged to enter many city centres across britain , after the government accepted in the high court on wednesday that its current plans to tackle the nation 's air pollution crisis were so poor they broke the law .", 
                "as damian carrington reports , the humiliating legal defeat is the second in 18 months and ends years of inadequate action and delays to tackle the problem which causes 50,000 early deaths every year .", 
                "ministers are now bound to implement new measures to cut toxic air quickly and the prime minister , theresa may , indicated the government would this time respond positively : there is more to do and we will do it . ''", 
                "the most likely measure is using charges to deter polluting diesel vehicles from clean air zones '' in urban centres , which could be in place next year in london and in 2018 in birmingham and other cities .", 
                "the labour mp marie rimmer has walked free from court after a sheriff described allegations that she had assaulted a scottish independence campaigner as a storm in a tea cup '' .",

                "enda kenny 's warning that the uk 's negotiations with the eu states over brexit could turn out to be vicious is perhaps a portent of things to come .", 
                "clearly given the importance of anglo-irish relations , the border with northern ireland , the billions in trade across the irish sea , the government in dublin is worried about the prospect of a fresh diplomatic war breaking between the eu and the uk whenever theresa may triggers article 50 .", 
                "another significant part of the taoiseach 's contribution today during the all-island summit on brexit in dublin was kenny suggesting that his british counterpart might press the exit button before the spring .", 
                "was kenny hinting that pressure to get to an earlier brexit from within the tory party was pushing the uk out the eu door before the spring of 2017 ?", 
                "or indeed was the irish premier sending a warning signal to london about the perils of doing so without negotiations having been properly started and exit strategies properly thought out ?", 
                "the main absentees from the royal hospital kilmainham , a former military hospital and now the museum of modern art in ireland , were the unionists .", 
                "neither the pro-brexit democratic unionists or the pro-remain ulster unionists attended .", 
                "both parties have argued that today 's conference went beyond the remit of the agreements that established devolution , power sharing and north-south bodies under the island of ireland : the 1998 good friday agreement and the 2006 st andrews agreement .", 
                "in a sense they are right because the main business between all the political traditions on the island regarding brexit will be done at the next north-south ministerial council , which will take place on 18 november in armagh city .", 
                "away from the rhetoric there appears to be a willingness between unionism and nationalism to hatch a pragmatic deal that will not destabilise peace or plunge the island economy into the abyss .", 
                "this cross-border body was established under the good friday peace deal and brings together ministers from dublin to belfast to discuss all island matters .", 
                "which obviously would include how do both states on the island cope with brexit .", 
                "another important meeting takes place next week in downing street when theresa may again invites the leaders of the devolved parliaments in belfast , edinburgh and cardiff to number 10 to discuss brexit negotiations and plans ahead to deal with the 26 eu states .", 
                "today 's conference now seems to have been a means by which dublin sent out two messages to london and the other eu capitals .",

                "to their fellow europeans , kenny 's suggestion that the other eu states should not get obsessed over what britain gets is also a warning that if other countries start to issue specific demands of their own as pay-off to london then the entire european project could be put in peril .",
