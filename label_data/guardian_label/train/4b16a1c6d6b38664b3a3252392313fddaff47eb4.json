                "he said : there is a crisis of confidence in america to make sure we can keep this country safe and this would allow the united states to stop , take a break , have a look and make sure everything is cool .",

                "the campaign adviser expressed confidence that it would be easy to determine if those seeking to enter the united states were muslim because immigration officers could simply ask the question .",
