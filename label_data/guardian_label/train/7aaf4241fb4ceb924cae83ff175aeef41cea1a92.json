                "rory stewart macleod for the guardian before vowing to contact every flood-hit parish , stewart has been involved in a spat with guardian columnist george monbiot .", 
                "in his tuesday column monbiot criticised stewart , and lib dem leader tim farron , for questioning calls for the better management of watersheds to prevent flooding .", 
                "in 2013 , rory stewart blasted the national trust because it allows water to ruin the lowland pastures of their small tenant farms , apparently on the advice of the environment agency .", 
                "in 2014 , he mocked the rspb and the water company united utilities for managing their land in a way that \u0080\u0098increased biodiversity , decreased flooding , increased carbon capture ' now messrs stewart and farron wring their hands and wring out their clothes , lamenting this inexplicable act of god .", 
                "stewart appears to be sticking to his views but offered to discuss the issue with monbiot as well as the environment agency and the met office .", 
                "rory stewart ( @ rorystewartuk ) @ georgemonbiot @ twitterid - we 'll be in touch - prime driver has been rainfall intensity not grazing - suggest talk with ea +met office writing on the conservativehome blog , andrew gimson said stewart 's run-in with monbiot will be regarded as a feather in his new flood minister 's cap .", 
                "here 's an extract of gimson 's sympathetic profile of stewart : early life was crowded with incident : he had been under fire in iraq , walked 6,000 miles across asia , written a successful book about the afghan section of that walk , become a professor at harvard and sold the rights to his story to brad pitt , who was reported to be planning a major motion with orlando bloom as the hero .", 
                "and now stewart is parliamentary under secretary of state for environment and rural affairs .", 
                "just now , this means he is floods minister .", 
                "his gift for being on the spot as dramatic events unfold has not deserted him .", 
                "his vast constituency of penrith and the border has been grievously afflicted by the floods .", 
                "even in normal times it can take two hours to drive from one end of the seat to the other , which is the largest in england and includes 40 miles of the border with scotland .", 
                "we have seen stewart popping up all over this great expanse of country in a high-visibility jacket , paying tribute in an earnest tone to the emergency services , including contingents from as far away as cornwall , and to his own constituents .", 
                "there has been a total absence of churchillian bombast , and a palpable concern for people whose livelihoods have been wrecked .", 
                "it falls to him as well as to his boss , liz truss , the environment secretary , to defend the tories ' record since 2010 on flood defence .", 
                "he has been denounced in the guardian by george monbiot : a rite of passage without which one can not be said , in environmental circles , to have arrived ."
