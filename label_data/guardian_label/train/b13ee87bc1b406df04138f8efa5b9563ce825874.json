                "neil puts the case for the prosecution the toughest questions in the folder and he did it tonight brilliantly , just as he did with theresa may on monday .", 
                "and how did jeremy corbyn do ?", 
                "overall , pretty well .",

                "corbyn was also evasive at times , but he was less formulaic than may and more willing to engage in argument .", 
                "the tories will be hoping that 10 minutes on prime time advertising corbyn 's sympathy for the ira will do them wonders .", 
                "with some voters , perhaps it will .", 
                "but it does feel as if , for many people , this is already priced in ( ie , they knew it already ) and the fact that thankfully irish republican terrorism is in the past may give this attack line less purchase than the tories might have expected .", 
                "here are the main points .", 
                "corbyn refused to say that he personally supported the renewal of trident and he said labour 's proposed defence review would look at the role of nuclear weapons .", 
                "he said the party as a whole backed trident renewal .", 
                "but he would not say he backed it personally and , when pressed on this , he said : i voted against the renewal .",

                "that is the decision that 's been taken ; i respect that decision going ahead .", 
                "corbyn repeatedly said that labour was going ahead with trident .", 
                "but he also said there would be a defence review under a labour government looking at the totality of policy , including the role of nuclear weapons , with the result that viewers may have concluded that labour 's commitment to keeping trident is not 100 % .", 
                "he said he did n't and does n't support the ira .", 
                "when asked about this , he said : i did n't support the ira .",

                "but he said he has always worked for peace .", 
                "when asked if he ever told the sinn f\u00e3\u00a9in figures he met , who represented the ira , to give up violence , he said : i always said the bombing process would never work that there was n't a military solution to be found in northern ireland .",

                "i made that very clear in the house of commons and other places .", 
                "he insisted he supported nato .", 
                "he said : i want to work within nato to achieve stability .", 
                "i want to work within nato to promote a human rights democracy and under a labour government that 's exactly what we 'd be doing .", 
                "he admitted that he thought that , at the end of the cold war , nato could have been replaced by the organisation of security and cooperation in europe .", 
                "but he failed to explain why he described nato as a danger to world peace three years ago , or why he said only two years ago it should be wound up .", 
                "he defended the speech he gave earlier today saying there was a link between foreign policy and terror , saying that he was just making an argument that has also been made by boris johnson in 2005 , two former heads of mi5 , and of course the foreign affairs select committee .", 
                "he said he did not accept the institute for fiscal studies claim that the overall level of tax would reach its highest peacetime level under labour 's plans .",

                "this morning ben wallace , the conservative security minister , said the speech jeremy corbyn would be giving later today would be crass and appalling .", 
                "( see 8.30am . )", 
                "sir michael fallon , the defence secretary , was even more caustic on the bbc news a few minutes ago .", 
                "( see 12.34pm . )", 
                "yet there was nothing in the speech that justified such severe criticism .", 
                "in the event what was striking about it was the extent to which he went out of his way to avoid controversy .", 
                "it might not have been a speech that made corbyn sound more like a future prime minister to the floating voter .", 
                "but it did not contain anything that a fair-minded listener would find objectionable either .", 
                "since the manchester arena attack it has been clear from social media that some on the left have been itching to lay some of the blame for what happened on theresa may and the police cuts implemented by the conservatives since 2010 .", 
                "may probably regrets telling a police officer in 2015 who argued that cuts to community policing in manchester would limit the supply of terrorism intelligence that he was scaremongering .", 
                "corbyn said today he would put more officers on the streets .", 
                "but at no point did he try to argue , as ukip 's suzanne evans did yesterday , that may was somehow partially or indirectly responsible for what happened .", 
                "no government can prevent every terrorist attack , he said .", 
                "if an individual is determined enough and callous enough , sometimes they will get through .", 
                "most people will think he was right .", 
                "corbyn did argue that foreign policy was factor in the rise of islamist extremism , and the extract from the speech released in advance suggested he was using it to renew hostilities with tony blair .", 
                "this argument is contentious because a quick look at the list of the countries in europe that have suffered from jihadi terrorism since 9/11 shows that some of the worst hit , such as france , belgium and germany , are ones that had nothing to do with invading iraq .", 
                "deaths from terrorism in europe from 9/11 to march 2017 .", 
                "corbyn was right , though , to say that experts warned that the wars britain fought could increase the risk of terrorism at home .", 
                "( see 8.51am for examples . )", 
                "but , in an act of considerable restraint ( given how much time he has spent campaigning on this ) , corbyn did not even mention iraq .", 
                "instead he cited libya ( where salman abedi was before he returned to the uk to attack manchester ) as an example of a failed intervention .", 
                "the tory-dominated commons foreign affairs committee , which published a damning report on david cameron 's libya policy , would be the first to agree .", 
                "the real objection to what corbyn said about foreign policy may be that he was attacking a mindset that no longer applies .", 
                "corbyn said the war on terror is simply not working but ministers gave up regularly using the phrase war on terror some years ago .", 
                "at some point during the bush era policy-makers realised that fighting a war against an abstract noun is a bad idea .", 
                "i ca n't find any reference to theresa may using the phrase .", 
                "and , in her speech to republicans in philadelphia earlier this year , may made it clear she had reservations of her own about blair/cameron-style interventions .", 
                "she told her audience : this can not mean a return to the failed policies of the past .", 
                "the days of britain and america intervening in sovereign countries in an attempt to remake the world in our own image are over .", 
                "that could have come straight out of corbyn 's speech today .", 
                "the problem with corbyn 's speech was not so much what he did say , as what he did n't .", 
                "he had almost nothing to say about what adopting a more informed understanding of the causes of terrorism would mean in practice .", 
                "may is not blair , but she is not corbyn either , and a corbyn foreign policy would be very different from hers .", 
                "but he did not say any more today about how , and he did not hang around to answer questions .", 
                "luckily andrew neil is on the case tonight .", 
                "robbie gibb ( @ robbiegibb ) andrew neil will interview the leader of the labour party , jeremy corbyn at 7pm , bbc one # bbcelection a few weeks ago corbyn was rather equivocal when pressed by andrew marr ( pdf ) as to whether he would be willing , as prime minister , to authorise a drone strike to kill the leader of islamic state ( isis ) .",

                "but the core of the speech and the element that has already won him a rebuke from former lib dem leader paddy ashdown : now is not the time , and this is not the event , to seek political advantage will be his argument that there are connections to be made between british foreign policy and terror attacks .", 
                "the government , he will say , must ensure : our foreign policy reduces rather than increases the threat to this country \u0080\u00a6 many experts , including professionals in our intelligence and security services , have pointed to the connections between wars our government has supported or fought in other countries and terrorism here at home .",
