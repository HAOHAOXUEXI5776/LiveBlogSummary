                "while greece 's creditors have , somewhat grudgingly , accepted athens reform plan , prime minister alexis tsipras must now handle critics inside his own party who are unhappy that he compromised to get a four-month extension deal .", 
                "there were murmurings last night that some of tsipras 's cabinet have concerns about the deal ; energy minister panayiotis lafazanis is n't happy that privatisations are n't being rolled back .", 
                "and tsipras 's political opponents are queuing up to put the boot in .", 
                "pasok leader evangelos venizelos , the former deputy pm , railed against the new government last night .", 
                "he claimed tsipras is dragging greece into an avoidable third bailout : just as we were poised to exit the memorandum and take up a precautionary credit line with much more comfortable terms , we are stuck with the old memorandum for month and are preparing for a third memorandum from july , '' and in germany too , some mps are worried that greece getting more leeway - and fret about what happens in four months time .", 
                "german mps vote on friday .", 
                "peter spiegel ( @ spiegelpeter ) where will the more opposition to # greece bailout extension : bundestag or greek parliament ?", 
                "financial investors remain pleased .", 
                "asian stocks markets were pretty calm overnight , after another day of records on wall street - and , finally , in london too yesterday : ftse 100 hits record high of 6959 after greece 's reform plan is approved but analysts are worried that both the international monetary fund and the european central bank warned yesterday that greece 's reform plans are too vague .", 
                "as michael hewson of cmc markets puts it this morning : while the agreement is welcome it does n't change the fact that greece still has limited access to funds , and also does n't hide the fact that both the imf and ecb expressed concerns about the level of detail , and indicated that they would insist that greece would need to do more if it wanted the release of additional bailout monies .", 
                "so , this crisis ai n't over .", 
                "but it could be a little calmer , for a while anyway i 'll be tracking all the main events through the day ."
