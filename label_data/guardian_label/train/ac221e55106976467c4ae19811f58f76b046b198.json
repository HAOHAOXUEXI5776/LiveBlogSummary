                "and despite sch\u00e4uble 's caution , the idea of giving greece some leeway to draw up reforms is apparently being very seriously '' considered .", 
                "helena smith , our correspondent in athens , reports : well-placed german officials with intimate knowledge of the state of negotiations - and the various scenarios on offer - are saying the prospect of athens being given a four-month breather '' that would allow it to drum up a detailed list of reforms is now being studied seriously .", 
                "moreover , it is likely to be the focus of tonight 's meeting between the german chancellor angela merkel and alexis tsipras her greek counterpart .", 
                "one insider revealed : a very senior german official speaking in the most measured of ways and with a great deal of forethought described this as a possible outcome that was now very seriously being discussed , '' it would be entirely logical .", 
                "if it does n't happen we 're looking at a scenario like cyprus with capital controls and banks closed as close as you can get to euro exit . `` .", 
                "with greece 's debt repayment schedule being so heavy this year - it owes \u20ac6.2bn to the ecb in july and august alone - 2015 offers the one window of opportunity to force tsipras ' hand .", 
                "in exchange for tiding the debt-stricken country over , tsipras 's anti-austerity government would have to produce a compelling and comprehensive package that would persuade creditors athens was finally determined to get down to the business of reform .", 
                "our source says : the big challenge is that it does n't look like a repetition of the extension we had in february .", 
                "it would have to look a lot different because it is that solution that got us to where we are today .", 
                "there 's only one point in creating a financial bridge like this and that is if the european side genuinely believes it will lead to reform . ''", 
                "greek prime minister alexis tsipras .", 
                "kolesidis/epa but experts are saying after four months of seemingly stalled negotiations the gap-stop solution makes eminent sense - not least because it gives the leftist-led government enough time to either hold a referendum or call fresh elections , polls that the governing syriza party would almost certainly win hands down .", 
                "both scenarios would allow tsipras to deal with militants in his party and move to the centre stage offering clarity to a political landscape blighted by syriza 's two seemingly incompatible aims : to ensure greece stays in the euro zone while at the same time eradicating austerity .", 
                "this scenario makes sense because it would provide sufficient time for greece to hold a referendum or election both of which would ease syriza 's position , '' said kevin featherstone , who heads the hellenic observatory at the london school of economics .", 
                "it 's the one scenario that brings the two of them [ merkel and tsipras ] together and i have no doubt they will be talking about it [ tonight ] . `` .", 
                "in many ways the solution would also be a bonanza for europe 's first anti-austerity leader because it would offer him the chance to emerge as the leader of the entire centre left .", 
                "the alternative is a place in the history books as the prime minister that oversaw greece 's crash out of the euro and the chaos that would inevitably ensue .", 
                "it depends on who he [ tsipras ] wants to be , '' said professor featherstone .", 
                "he still has to make the choice between staying in the euro zone and enforcing the necessary concessions or alleviating the suffering from austerity and leaving the euro zone . ''", 
                "any deal would almost certainly acknowledge his government 's desire to alleviate social hardship , featherstone added .", 
                "in all likelihood it will have fewer reforms and allow tsipras to claim that he tried his best . ''", 
                "as we wrote this morning , eurasia group also predicts that a deal will be reached next month but there 's no doubt that tsipras is under pressure from his radical faction .", 
                "earlier today mep manolis glezos , a legendary figure for leftists , called on greeks to take to the streets and described both the eu and imf as sadistic '' .", 
                "now is the time to show that we have kept the ideology of resistance , '' said the 92-year-old , who shot to fame tearing down the swastika from the acropolis during greece 's brutal german occupation , adding : we owe it to the generations that are coming to pour onto the streets to prove to the profiteers that we have no more blood to give and to say to our government that we are with it as long as it does n't take a step back .",
