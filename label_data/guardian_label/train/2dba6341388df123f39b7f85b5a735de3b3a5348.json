                "it has been a rather odd occasion - not a debate about brexit , but a debate about how parliament debates brexit - but given that we now live in world where the pound can rally following the publication of government amendments to opposition day motions ( see 11.50am ) , these procedural wrangles matter .", 
                "mps are set to approve a motion with cross-party support saying the commons must have a full and transparent '' debate on the government 's plans for brexit before article 50 is invoked , but ministers are refusing to commit themselves to giving parliament an actual vote on the matter .", 
                "theresa may made this clear at pmqs ( see 12.36pm ) and david davis , the brexit secretary , would not promise a substantive vote either in his speech at the start of the debate .", 
                "it may well be the case that eventually mps do get a vote , but any vote on a substantive motion would constrain the government , and also allow the possibility of tory mps rebelling with labour , and may seems determined to resist it if at all possible .", 
                "in his impressive debut as shadow brexit secretary sir keir starmer confimed that labour was not explicitly demanding a vote in its motion because it wanted to maximise the chances of mps voting for it tonight .", 
                "( see 1.37pm . )", 
                "davis has played down suggestions that the government will publish a white paper or a green paper on brexit .", 
                "when it was put to him that a fellow minister , george eustice , said a brexit white paper was likely to be published , davis dismissed the idea .", 
                "later he seemed to hint that one could be published .", 
                "i should also tell the house i have asked the chief whip to ensure we have a series of debates so that the house can air its views .", 
                "and it would be again very surprising if we had those debates without presenting to the house something for them to debate .", 
                "but a source in the department for brexit said that davis was not intending to suggest that policy papers would be published before the debates .", 
                "davis was just referring to the fact that ministers would keep mps updated , the source said .", 
                "a conservative former minister has accused the government of pursuing a brexit policy driven by ideology , not national interest .", 
                "in a question to davis claire perry , the former transport minister , said : i am extremely concerned by what has happened to sterling and what has happened to interest rates since the prime minister 's comments at the conference last week .",
