                "good afternoon and welcome to our live blog coverage of an announcement by barack obama of major changes to us immigration policy .", 
                "in a primetime tv address from the white house this evening , the president is expected to describe new executive actions that would remove the immediate threat of deportation for millions of immigrants living in the united states without residency documents .", 
                "the speech is a culmination of six years of struggle between a president who has made big promises about reform and congresses that have gone from cold to hot and back about rewriting immigration laws .", 
                "critics of the president say his apparent decision to act unilaterally on the issue amounts to a gross usurpation of power .", 
                "reform advocates are saying something more along the lines of : finally .", 
                "according to details dished to the press , the executive actions obama is set to announce tonight could affect around five million immigrants , from two main groups : families of children who are citizens or legal residents of the us , and young people who came to the country as children .", 
                "the president took action to protect an estimated 580,000 members of the latter group in his first big order on immigration back in june 2012 .", 
                "hours before the speech is to begin , republicans in congress already are attacking it .", 
                "the president will come to regret the chapter history writes if he does move forward , incoming majority leader mitch mcconnell said in a speech on the senate floor on thursday .", 
                "when the newly elected representatives of the people take their seats , they will act .", 
                "there 's a lot more where that came from .", 
                "this blog will round up the most trenchant observations from both sides of the aisle , consider the constitutionality of what is happening , look back at obama 's immigration record so far and , importantly , handicap the latin grammys .", 
                "for now we leave you with this preview of tonight 's speech from the man himself , employing the traditional single-butt-cheek-on-the-resolute-desk stance for notices of impending executive actions :"
