                "satire , like everything else , was much more closely controlled in the 1930s than in the previous decade , so the satirical content of the novel would have obviously proved problematic had any attempt been made to publish .", 
                "in other respects too , the demands of socialist realism were simply not met by the novel - no positive hero , a great deal of non-realistic material , diffcult subject matter ; and the religious content could readily have been considered 'anti-soviet ' , as such themes were broadly discouraged .",
