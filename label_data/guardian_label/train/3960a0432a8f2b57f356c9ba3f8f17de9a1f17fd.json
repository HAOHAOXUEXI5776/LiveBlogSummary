                "david davis , the brexit secretary , defended theresa may 's decision to say that eu nationals coming to the eu during the brexit transition will not get the same rights as those here before .", 
                "eu leaders have said this would go against the agreement reached in december at the end of phase one of the brexit talks .", 
                "( see 10.13am . )", 
                "but davis said he did not accept this .", 
                "he told mps : in the joint report which we concluded and got agreement on in december , the european union agreed that the transition date , the end date for ongoing permanent residents ' rights - not possibilities , rights - will be march 2019 .", 
                "and his junior minister robin walker said : the citizens ' rights agreement reached in december , and set out in the joint report , does give certainty about the rights of eu citizens already here going forward .", 
                "but this agreement does not cover those who are arriving after we leave the eu .", 
                "davis is right about the joint report ( pdf ) .", 
                "it says in paragraph 6 that the withdrawal agreement will provide reciprocal protection for union and uk citizens , to enable the effective exercise of rights derived from union law and based on past life choices , where those citizens have exercised free movement rights by the specified date '' and in paragraph 8 that the specified date '' was when the uk left the eu .", 
                "but , when the joint report was published , the european commission also published its own document ( pdf ) setting out its own interpretation of what was agreed and it said , in the event of there being a transition , eu nationals arriving during the transition should get protected rights too .", 
                "it said : this 'specified date ' should be the date of the united kingdom 's withdrawal from the union , without prejudice to discussions , in the second phase of the negotiations , on a possible transitional period and on appropriate adaptations flowing from it as regards the specified date '' .", 
                "in the commission 's view , in case of any transitional period implying the continued application of the union 's acquis on the fundamental freedoms , it is clear that citizens would need to be fully entitled to their rights to free movement as before the united kingdom 's withdrawal , and that , therefore , the provisions of the withdrawal agreement on the content of citizens ' rights and on governance as regards those rights can only become applicable at the end of such transitional period .", 
                "in other words , in such case , the 'specified date ' should , in the commission 's view , be defined not as the date of the united kingdom 's withdrawal , but as that of the end of the transitional period .", 
                "steve baker , a brexit minister , refused to dismiss a claim that civil servants were rigging their brexit analyses to show that the uk should stay in the customs union .", 
                "the claim was made by the tory brexiter jacob rees-mogg .", 
                "he asked baker if he had heard the claim from charles grant , director of the centre for european reform , that officials in the treasury have deliberately developed a model to show that all options other than staying in the customs union were bad and that officials intended to use this to influence policy '' .", 
                "rees-mogg went on : if this is correct , does he share my view that it goes against the spirit of the northcote-trevelyan reforms that underpin our independent civil service ?", 
                "baker replied : i am sorry to say that my honourable friend 's account is essentially correct . ''", 
                "but then he made it clear that he was saying it was correct that grant had made this claim , not that he was saying the claim was necessary true .", 
                "but baker did not dismiss the claim either .", 
                "he told mps : at the time i considered it implausible because my direct experience is that civil servants are extraordinarily careful to uphold the impartiality of the civil service .", 
                "i think we must proceed with great caution in this matter but i heard [ grant ] raise this issue .", 
                "i think we need to be very careful not to take this forward in an inappropriate way .", 
                "but he has reminded me of something which i heard .", 
                "i think it would be quite extraordinary if it turned out that such a thing had happened .", 
                "the centre for european reform is due to put out a response soon .", 
                "( it may well be that rees-mogg has misunderstood grant , and that grant was simply saying treasury officials thought their models would show that staying in the customs unions was the best option , not that they had been rigged to produce this outcome . )",

                "asked by labour 's sir keir starmer when he first found out about the work , davis said : actually , i told the select committee that this work was under way last december .", 
                "davis said officials were trying to produce a model for what would happen to the economy after brexit that was more accurate than previous models .", 
                "he said : we are trying to do something which is incredibly difficult .", 
                "every forecast that has been made about the period post-referendum has been wrong .", 
                "what has been going on has been an attempt to find a way of getting a better outcome .", 
                "he said that the uk 's share of eu assets had been taken into account when the brexit bill '' ( my term , not his ) had been calculated .", 
                "the uk has agreed to pay the eu up to \u00a3 39bn when it leaves .", 
                "asked what would happen to the uk 's share of eu assets , davis replied : this was a proponent of the negotiation which brought the public claim down from 100bn to 35bn .", 
                "part of that was offset by our assets .", 
                "davis did not specify whether he was talking in euros ( at one point it was reported that the eu was demanding up to \u20ac100bn ) or in pounds ( the government has said it will end up paying between \u00a3 35bn and \u00a3 39bn .", 
                "( i 've corrected the earlier post on this , because it wrongly quoted davis as saying half '' of the reduction was caused by the uk 's share of eu assets being taken into account , not part '' .",
