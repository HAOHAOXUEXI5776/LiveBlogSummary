                "the dramatic shifts in polling numbers have been argued in many places to be a function of a sudden surge in young voters and/or 2015 non-voters , motivated by jeremy corbyn 's populist platform including the abolition of student tuition fees and return to state funded grants .", 
                "the survation poll this morning revealed that 82 % of 18-24s would/already have voted , which compares favourably with the next two older age cohorts and is only a tick below that of the uniformly voting 55+ cohorts .", 
                "either this a full re-writing of the psephological textbook or needs to be viewed with extreme caution .", 
                "our own poll , suggests that about half that number ( 44 % saying 10/10 certainty ) of 18-24s will actually vote ( even when full unweighted , it was only 50 % ) .", 
                "clearly , this difference does bring to a head the new methodological battleground .", 
                "some pollsters , especially icm , believe that the turnout scale no longer has value in disentangling voters from non-voters , because the fieldwork process ( phone and telephone ) predominately fails to reach the latter who are less interested in politics and by corollary , less interested in answering survey research .", 
                "icm stopped phone polling after the eu referendum , partly because we found it incredibly difficult to reach certain demographic groups especially 18-24s .", 
                "we , along with other pollsters ty reached half or less of the 18-24 target ( by phone ) .", 
                "we note with interest that survation did a brilliant job in reaching them though a full 80 % of the target number ( up-weighting them takes care of the missing residual ) .", 
                "whether survation achieved this through full random digit dialling or whether they utilised some targeted sample would be interesting to know , but either way , the great irony about being good at their job is that this success could easily introduce the very skew that kills the poll 's accuracy .", 
                "if the 18-24s reached are in some way different to the 18-24s not reached , i.e in saying they will disproportionately vote and vote labour at that - when their wider counterparts will not and do not - it 's likely that the same failings of 2015 will be very much embedded in this sample .", 
                "so how pollsters address the turnout issue is now central to what the poll says .", 
                "we at icm turnout weight using a matrix that assumes younger people will be less likely to vote than older , and less affluent people will be less likely to vote than the wealthy .", 
                "this has been the general pattern of general election 's for an age , and whether you believe our poll findings or those of others will depend on whether or not you think jeremy corbyn can actually buck that trend .",

                "firming up an argument that she has been making since the eu referendum result last summer , she will say : because since the very moment the british people took that momentous decision , it was clear to me that it was not just a vote to leave the european union .", 
                "it was also a vote to change the way the country works and the people for whom it works forever .",

                "jeremy corbyn is often accused of wanting to take britain back to the 1970s , but , if this is anything to go by , it is theresa may who is seeking inspiration from the labour party of harold wilson and tony benn .", 
                "the final sentence quoted above contains an echo of labour 's 1974 manifesto promise to deliver a fundamental and irreversible shift in the balance of power and wealth in favour of working people and their families , a commitment that resurfaced in the 1983 labour manifesto ( aka , the longest suicide note ) .",

                "it 's not about the money \u0080\u00a6 except when it is quizzed by an audience member on cuts to school funding , may said that was n't the issue : people are focusing on funding but we need to ensure that we see more good or outstanding schools .",

                "the party is lounging comfortably atop the polls in scotland , but defending 56 of 59 westminster seats ( and under pressure from a perkier scottish conservative party ) means that even a win on 8 june is likely to come with a few losses .", 
                "nicola sturgeon will today stress the party 's commitment to counter austerity measures , promising her mps would vote against cuts to health spending in england a nod to that notional progressive alliance as well as pledging to scrap the 1 % public sector pay cap , keep winter fuel payments as a universal pensioner benefit , and add a 50p top tax rate ( as long as the rest of the uk joined in ) .",

                "and in a sign that corbyn 's comments on security might not have been the misstep painted by his opponents ( including boris johnson , who , of course , had said the very same thing ) , the survation poll found 46 % thought uk military interventions overseas did increase the risk of terror attacks at home ; 14 % thought the opposite .",

                "by attempting to highlight labour 's failings they are simply reinforcing their own flaws \u0080\u00a6 for all his left-wing views , the jam-making , courgette-growing , bearded labour leader looks like a herbivore while the tory one increasingly appears red in tooth and claw , not only carnivorous but cannibalistic in her mauling of her rival .", 
                "there is , as she herself might say , something distinctly \u0080\u0098nasty ' about the conservative strategy .",
