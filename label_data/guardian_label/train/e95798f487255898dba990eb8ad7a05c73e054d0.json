                "stephen crabb has used his debut performance at the despatch box as work and pensions secretary to announce that the government has no plans for further welfare cuts this parliament .",

                "labour mps subsequently said that this did not amount to a cast-iron commitment not to make any further welfare cuts before the 2020 election , and a treasury briefing suggested that the government is keeping the option of further cuts open .", 
                "but charities welcomed the announcement as a serious statement of intent .", 
                "the child poverty action group said : stephen crabb is to be congratulated for halting the pip cuts and saying that there will be no more social security cuts this parliament ministers must now consult on the next steps for welfare reform to ensure that the lowest income households do not continue to subsidise gains for better off groups .", 
                "and the disability charity scope said : disabled people will be relieved that the new secretary of state used his first speech to confirm that there are no plans to make further welfare cuts and that he would like to start a new conversation with disabled people .", 
                "ministers have refused to say how the government will fill the \u00e2\u00a3 4.4bn black hole left in the budget by the decision to cancel the pip cuts .",

                "cameron said : [ duncan smith ] spent almost a decade campaigning for welfare reform and improving people 's life chances and he has spent the last six years implementing those policies in government .", 
                "and in that time we have seen nearly half a million fewer children living in workless households , over a million fewer people on out of work benefits , and nearly 2.4 million more people in work .", 
                "and in spite of having to take difficult decisions on the deficit - child poverty , inequality , pensioner poverty are all down .",

                "david cameron is preparing for a commons statement which he will try to use to repair some of the damage caused to his government by iain duncan smith 's resignation and by the budget u-turn over disability cuts .", 
                "his statement will be mostly focused on last week 's eu summit , but he will face questions from mps for more than an hour and number 10 has indicated that he will use it to insist that he remains committed to one nation conservatism .", 
                "duncan smith suggested in his resignation statement and his interview with andrew marr yesterday that the government was now only acting in the interests of its own supporters , particularly the wealthy and pensioners .", 
                "george osborne has ducked a challenge to come to the commons to defend his budget .", 
                "labour 's john mcdonnell has tabled an urgent question , but osborne has chosen not to respond to it , sending his treasury colleague david gauke to the despatch box to deal with the questions instead .", 
                "the uq will start at 3.30pm , and cameron 's statement will start soon after 4pm , and i will be covering both in detail .", 
                "the institute for fiscal studies has said that poorer working-age households , especially those with children , will be hit hard by the government 's tax and benefits changes while pensioners will be protected , a respected economic think-tank has found .", 
                "in an analysis of the tax and benefit changes coming into effect in this parliament it says : again , pensioners are protected while poorer working age households are hit hard , especially those with children .", 
                "this is the result of the continued protection of pensioner benefits ( including maintaining the \u0080\u0098triple lock ' on the basic state pension ) while making further deep cuts to working-age benefit spending .", 
                "again , households in the upper half of the income distribution ( but below the very top ) are likely to see little direct impact of tax and benefit changes on their incomes on average , as some benefits cuts and small tax rises are offset by further increases in the income tax personal allowance , and the raising of the higher rate threshold .", 
                "so the income distribution has narrowed , but tax and benefit changes planned for this parliament will likely help take it back to something like pre-recession levels .",

                "the european commission will publish plans this week to give eu states more flexibility over varying vat , and number 10 says these new eu rules will enable the government to abolish the tampon tax and cancel the planned vat rise for solar panels .",

                "many colleagues will have been surprised by the response to the recent esa [ employment and support allowance ] wrag [ work-related activity group ] benefit , which has led resulted in large amounts of personal abuse towards colleagues .",

                "the conservative party is in turmoil and iain duncan smith 's resignation has inflamed two conflicts that have been simmering in the party for years : the leave/remain feud over the eu ; and the dispute between one nation conservatism and thatcherite toryism .", 
                "it is often assumed that the thatcherites are always in the leave camp but , just to make things complicated , duncan smith , a prominent anti-eu figure , attacked david cameron and george osborne in his resignation letter for betraying the one nation tradition .", 
                "today we will get the cameron fightback because he is giving a statement in the commons .",

                "the chancellor of the exchequer should come back to parliament and explain that .", 
                "far from just iain duncan smith resigning , if a chancellor puts forward a budget - as he did - knowing full well that he is making this huge hit on the disabled , then really it should perhaps be him who should be considering his position .", 
                "his budget simply does n't add up and it unravelled within hours of him presenting it .", 
                "this is n't the first time a george osborne budget has unravelled .", 
                "it seems to me we need to look at the very heart of this government , at its incompetence , at the way it puts forward proposals that simply do n't add up and expects the most needy in our society to take the hit for them .",
