                "this was especially true of the local elections in 2012 .", 
                "the bbc 's projection of these results into a britain-wide election vote suggested that labour 's performance was worth 38 % of the vote , enough to put the party 7 points ahead of the conservatives .", 
                "it was easily the party 's best performance in any of the annual rounds of local elections held during the last parliament .",
