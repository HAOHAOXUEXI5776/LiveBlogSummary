                "interviewed on bbc radio scotland , hosie - a close ally to party leader nicola sturgeon - said the snp wanted to support a labour minority government but there 's no blank cheque ed miliband ca n't take the snp votes for granted . ''", 
                "after sturgeon confirmed on sunday night that the snp could oppose a labour queen 's speech , hosie was pressed on what would provoke his party to do so .", 
                "he said the price for snp support would be a deal with labour on the detail of any spending cuts plans or changes to the benefits system .", 
                "he told presenter gary robertson : well , we 've been very clear and upfront , transparent with the public because , i 've said this on the programme a number of times , we want to see an end to austerity , a modest increase in public expenditure which still sees the debt and deficit fall but which lifts the squeeze from ordinary people , we ca n't afford another \u00a3 30bn of cuts , another 5 years of misery for many , many people .", 
                "so we will make a very strong case to say that should there be a minority labour administration that we can help , we would like to see their approach trimmed , changed , adjusted in order to reflect the kind of wishes that we have .", 
                "hosie tried to adopt a far more conciliatory tone compared to previous interviews , where he 's taken a far more combative stance on the snp 's terms for backing labour , by insisting the snp wanted to be collaborative not confrontational .", 
                "but he cited warnings from labour backbencher john mcdonnell that up to 40 labour mps could also resist deep cuts in an ed balls budget , and implied that if a labour or tory administration pushed through spending cuts or nhs reforms the snp did not like , it could provoke a fresh referendum .", 
                "pressed on claims by snp candidates that a decision on staging a second referendum depended on the consequences of the election , hosie said they were right .", 
                "i think the point , we have to wait to see the outcome of this election is absolutely correct , you know if we are in a really strong position at westminster , to end austerity , to demand legitimately more powers for scotland , north of what the smith commission have proposed , we need to see how westminster responds to that if westminster responds positively to legitimate demands for example , for more powers or to end austerity or to fully fund the health service , that 's a good thing .", 
                "if on the other hand , they do n't ignore the snp , frankly i do n't care about that , but if they ignore the wishes of the scottish people , then i suspect that you , i and all the politicians would have to respond to what the people were saying at that point ."

                "in his book about the labour party under ed miliband , five year mission , tim bale writes about the impact of the rightwing press on the broadcast media and includes this quote from someone in miliband 's office .", 
                "ed 's been interviewed by john humphrys three times and two of the three times humphrys had the daily mail open next to him .", 
                "i do n't know if that was the case today , but humphrys questions were , to a large extent , the ones that the daily mail would have asked .", 
                "they were critical , but miliband held up pretty well .", 
                "there were various news lines ( see below ) but perhaps what was most interesting was what miliband said about the snp .", 
                "in one sense he was just saying something he has said many times before , but he was also hardening up his line .", 
                "he is now ruling out arrangements '' ( which , arguably , are looser than deals '' ) and he is even suggesting he wo n't even talk to alex salmond or nicola sturgeon about labour 's programme .", 
                "this is daft ; ministers talk to opposition parties about their plans all the time , because it is party of how sensible government works .", 
                "but miliband is being pushed into a position where , if he does form a minority government and makes even a miniscule concession to the snp , he will be accused of gross betrayal .", 
                "here are the key points .", 
                "miliband ruled out having an arrangement '' with the snp about passing labour legislation and even suggested he would refuse to have conversations with them .", 
                "this goes even further than the language was he was using last week .", 
                "early in the campaign miliband ruled out a coalition with the snp .", 
                "last week he clearly ruled out any deal '' with them , implying there would be no confidence and supply arrangements .", 
                "today he went further .", 
                "we are not going to have an arrangement with them .", 
                "he said he would put forward a labour queen 's speech .", 
                "what the snp did about that would be a matter for them .", 
                "john humphrys then asked him if he would have any conversations '' with the snp .", 
                "q : neither your nor any of your colleagues will have any conversations with anybody from the snp at any point after the election ?", 
                "miliband replied : we 're not going to negotiate about the queen 's speech , no .", 
                "we are not going to negotiate with the snp .", 
                "humphrys said miliband was redefining the question .", 
                "he tried again .", 
                "q : i 'm asking if you 're going to have any conversations with them .", 
                "miliband replied : i 'm not planning that , no .", 
                "we 're not going to negotiate about the queen 's speech .", 
                "i 'm going to put a labour queen 's speech before the house of commons .", 
                "miliband strongly defended his decision to commission a stone monument engraved with labour 's election pledges , saying it was vital to show people they could trust him .", 
                "asked if he regretted it , he replied : not at all , because i think trust is a huge issue in this election .", 
                "the difference with our pledges is that they are not going to expire on may 8 nick clegg went into the last election saying he would cut tuition fees .", 
                "he trebled them .", 
                "david cameron went into the last election saying no iffs , no buts , net migration down to the tens of thousands .", 
                "it 's 298,000 .", 
                "we are setting out promises ; they do n't expire on may 8 .", 
                "asked about the negative reaction , he said : it got people talking '' .", 
                "and he brushed aside a critical article about it in the guardian .", 
                "they do n't always get everything right , '' he said .", 
                "he implied that he might not try to have have the stone installed in the downing street garden .", 
                "at the weekend labour said this was the intention , but it has been said he would not get planning permission .", 
                "asked where the stone might go , miliband said he would leave the landscape gardening to others .", 
                "he said that david cameron was desperate '' and that he was trying to stir up divisions between england and scotland because he was losing the key election arguments .", 
                "david cameron is a pretty desperate man , i just want to make this point .", 
                "he 's a desperate man because what he 's reduced to is trying to set this election up as a clash of two nations .", 
                "he 's lost all the arguments .", 
                "he 's lost the argument about the economy , he 's lost the argument about leadership , he 's lost the argument about his broken promises on the nhs .", 
                "this is all he 's got left .", 
                "he also accused the tories of spraying promises around like there is no tomorrow '' without knowing how they would be funded .", 
                "he said a recent article from sir nick macpherson , the treasury permanent secretary , confirmed that the crash was not caused by the last labour government borrowing too much .", 
                "he refused to say whether a government led by a party that was not the largest in the commons would be legitimate .", 
                "he said he did not want to speculate about the election outcome , and that it was up to constitutionalists to talk about the constitution .",
