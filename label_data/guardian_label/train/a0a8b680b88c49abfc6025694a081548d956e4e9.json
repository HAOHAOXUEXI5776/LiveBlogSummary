                "good morning , and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy , the financial markets , the eurozone and business .", 
                "britain 's service sector makes up around 80 % of the economy , from hotels and restaurants to haulage firms , accountants , and it companies .", 
                "so investors are nervously waiting to discover how they fared in june , and if last month 's general election had any impact .", 
                "data firm markit 's monthly service sector pmi , due at 9,30am , is expected to drop to 53.5 from 53.8 in may .", 
                "that would show that growth slowed last month , ( 50 being the cut-off point between expansion and contraction ) , and reinforce concerns that the economy is suffering from political uncertainty .", 
                "rbc capital markets say : as with the earlier manufacturing and construction surveys , we expect to see some pull back in the services pmi this month ; to 53.5 from 53.8 previously as the uncertainty caused by the general election result impacts on the predominantly domestically-focused sector .", 
                "even allowing for the weaker readings in the other sectors , an outcome in line with that expectation would still leave our pmi-based indicator pointing to gdp growth of 0.4 % q/q though it would also reinforce the signals from those other sectors of the economy losing some momentum at the end of the quarter .", 
                "the pmis are calculated by asking purchasing managers across the country how their business is performing , so it 's a useful snapshot of the situation .", 
                "given the size of the service sector , it could shift the pound - which is hovering around $ 1.291 his morning .", 
                "ipek ozkardeskaya ( @ ipekozkardeskay ) watching the # uk # pmiservices at 9:30am london time .", 
                "# gbpusd there 's also a flurry of other service sector reports from around the world today , including several european countries during the next couple of hours .", 
                "city investors are also bracing for the latest uk car sales figures , due this morning .", 
                "sales fell in april and may ( partly due to tax changes ) so june 's figure are nervously awaited .", 
                "a third fall would fuel fears that consumers are cutting back on big-ticket items ( and perhaps show that the bank of england should hold fire on interest rates ) .", 
                "on the corporate front , online supermarket chain ocado and housebuilding group persimmon are reporting results to the city .",
