                "davis said the delays in publishing the report could have cost lives .", 
                "since the announcement of the inquiry we have had three major foreign policy decisions that could have greatly benefitted from lessons learnt from the iraq war .", 
                "in libya we undertook a military intervention which was intended to prevent a massacre , but which was the precursor to protracted conflict and unrest following our nominal military victory .", 
                "in syria the government was blocked by this house from military intervention , an intervention which would have led us to providing military support to isis , our sworn enemies .", 
                "and now in iraq the uk has become embroiled in the ongoing civil war that has raged since the invasion in 2003 .", 
                "foreign policy , and specifically whether or not we go to war , is intrinsically a matter of life or death when such decisions are made without knowledge of all the facts mistakes are made and sometimes people die as a result .", 
                "the delay to the iraq inquiry could easily cost lives .", 
                "he said he did not think witnesses were to blame for the delays in publishing the report .", 
                "he said civil servants should not have been allowed to decide what was and was not published in the report .", 
                "sir richard scott was allowed to decide what he would release into the public domain unfettered by whitehall [ when he conducted the arms-to-iraq inquiry ] .", 
                "by contrast sir john chilcot - a man who is a past northern ireland permanent secretary , who has chaired an incredibly sensitive inquiry into intercept evidence , and who is considered a responsible keeper of government secrets - is tied up in protocols subject to the whim of whitehall the inquiry protocols are symptomatic of a mind set that seems to assume that serving civil servants are the only proper guardians of the public interest .", 
                "and that leads to a particular problem here .", 
                "if a minister is asked to make a decision which affects him , or his family , or his property , or even his constituency , the ministerial code requires him to step back from the decision - to recuse himself in the jargon - and let someone else make the decision .", 
                "this does not say that the minister is corrupt .", 
                "it simply ensures that there is no appearance of corruption , no chance of improper decision , and it removes the risk of unconscious bias .", 
                "no such rule appears to apply for civil servants .", 
                "this inquiry process is littered with people who were central to the very decisions the inquiry is investigating .", 
                "sir jeremy heywood was principal private secretary to tony blair for the entire period from 9/11 until the war .", 
                "yet he is whitehall 's gatekeeper as to what can and can not be published .", 
                "even the head of the inquiry secretariat , margaret aldred , was deputy head of the foreign and defence policy secretariat and therefore responsible for providing ministers with advice on defence and policy matters on iraq , and she was nominated to the inquiry by the previous cabinet secretary .", 
                "all of this would matter less if these ridiculous restrictive protocols on publication were not there .", 
                "like scott , sir john chilcot should be allowed to publish what he thinks is in the public interest - not what whitehall thinks is acceptable .", 
                "he said the iraq war was the greatest foreign policy failure of this generation '' .", 
                "and he said that as someone who voted for it , he said ."

                "here are the main points from nick clegg 's phone-in .", 
                "clegg said he had abandoned plans to scrap free bus passes for wealthy pensioners .", 
                "at one point he was proposing this , but clegg said he would now keep free bus passes for pensioners as a universal benefit , although he said the lib dems would take away winter fuel payments and free tv licences from wealthy pensioners .", 
                "( see 10.12am . )", 
                "clegg also defended providing free transport for disabled children as a universal benefit , and rejected suggestions that the millionaire katie price should have to pay herself for her disabled son 's transport .", 
                "we , as a society , think there are some things we should provide universally to everybody .", 
                "we make the nhs available to everybody , paupers or multi-millionaires , regardless of their wealth , based on need not ability to pay .", 
                "i think this may well be one of those areas where most people think , on balance , it is better to provide it universally .", 
                "of course , it means you get cases like that of katie price .", 
                "but i would be pretty reluctant to say , on the facts of this individual case , we should therefore throw out the idea of universally treating all children with disabilities with the same kind of compassion and support everywhere we can .", 
                "he said the state should not bribe '' people to improve their behaviour .", 
                "asked about a pilot scheme that involved getting pregnant women to stop smoking by offering them vouchers worth \u00a3 400 , he said he was perturbed '' by the implications of the idea .", 
                "i 'm slightly perturbed by this where does this end ?", 
                "do you then given people cash in hand to provide their children with a healthy regular meal ?", 
                "do you then give people cheques to make sure their kids go to bed on time ?", 
                "i 'm perturbed in the sense that , at the end of the day , in any free , open , liberal society - yes , there are things that we 've got to try and encourage other people to do , but we 've also have to just assume that people will take responsibility for their own lives and for that of their loved ones .", 
                "and it is not for the state to come up with ever more exotic ways of incentivising or , worse still , trying to bribe people to do what is good for themselves and their loved ones in the first place .", 
                "he accused labour of hypocrisy over the nhs .", 
                "andy burnham had been ranting '' about the use of the private sector in the nhs , even though this was a policy promoted by the labour government , he said .", 
                "he said people who did n't like the coalition would find a coalition involving ukip or the snp far worse .", 
                "for people who do n't like this coalition , just have a look at those prospects .", 
                "the idea of nicola sturgeon or nigel farage basically with the whip hand over downing street would make the most fierce critics of this coalition slightly more benevolent in their attitude to this coalition .", 
                "he suggested the proposed multi-party leaders ' debates were too big to be interesting to viewers .", 
                "the danger with this increasingly laughable way in which the conservatives are pushing the broadcasters to invite an ever larger cast of people is - just imagine what it is going to be like for the viewing public ?", 
                "by the time everyone has done their one minute introduction , the whole nation will have switched over to coronation street .", 
                "he also mocked cameron 's stance on the debates , saying cameron would soon be calling for the inclusion of the monster raving loony party .", 
                "and he renewed his call for a four-party debate involving just labour , the conservatives , the lib dems and ukip .", 
                "he said pmqs was making people disillusioned with politics .", 
                "joking aside , i think it has descended into the most facile , yah-boo style politics .", 
                "the only people who get excited about it are the people in the westminster village who think the whole world revolves around who said what , who made what joke .", 
                "the vast majority of the british public , if they listen , they are pretty unimpressed .", 
                "actually , the vast majority of people do n't listen at all .", 
                "and perhaps that is a blessing in disguise , because if more people did see what happens every half an hour from midday to 12.30 on a wednesday , they would be even more disillusioned about westminster politics than many people already are .", 
                "he said the lib dem mp david ward was crass and insensitive '' when he used the word genocide '' to describe israel 's treatment of the palestinians in a message issued on holocaust memorial day .", 
                "he does n't speak for the party and i think this - on that day of all days - was a crass , insensitive thing to say .", 
                "to compare - however distressing it is to see - what is happening in gaza to the palestinian people to what has happened in darfur or cambodia or the holocaust is completely inappropriate .", 
                "is it something people take offence at ?", 
                "yes .", 
                "do i think it is wrong ?", 
                "yes .", 
                "but he does n't speak for the party and he never has .", 
                "he said he was today announcing plans to allocate \u00a3 1bn to local enterprise partnerships ."
