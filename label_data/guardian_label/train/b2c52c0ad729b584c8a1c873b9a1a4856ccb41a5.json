                "this prompted the snp leader nicola sturgeon , at a later q & a broadcast only in scotland , to say : i heard ed miliband and he sounded awfully like he was saying - and i hope i 'm wrong about this because i think people across scotland and the rest of the uk would be appalled if i 'm right , he sounded as if he was saying that he would rather see david cameron and the conservatives back in government than actually work with the snp .",

                "when the labour leader said no , a lowing sound could be heard , the noise of an audience uniting in sceptical rejection of the man before them - a reminder that one of miliband 's greatest errors since 2010 was his failure to debunk the narrative that blames labour profligacy for the country 's fiscal troubles .",
