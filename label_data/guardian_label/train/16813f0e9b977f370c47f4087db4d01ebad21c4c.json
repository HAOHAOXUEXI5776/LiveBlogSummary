                "with the inaugural balls well underway , we 're going to close our rolling coverage of the inauguration of the 45th president of the united states with a summary of the day 's events .", 
                "donald trump was sworn in by chief justice john roberts as the 45th president of the united states , as barack obama handed over white house to the businessman , who has never held office or served in the military and who rose to prominence among conservatives by questioning the legitimacy of the 44th president .", 
                "in his inaugural address , trump painted a bleak of american carnage across the country , speaking about inequality , abandoned factories like tombstones and the crime and the gangs and the drugs .", 
                "he promised : we will make america strong again , wealthy again , proud again , safe again and , yes , together we will make america great again .", 
                "trump pledged an america first policy in all things , using a phrase that has been denounced by the anti-defamation league for its roots with 1940s nazi sympathizers .", 
                "we 've defended other nations ' borders while refusing to defend our own , trump said .", 
                "but that is the past .", 
                "and now we are looking only to the future .", 
                "the speech at times veered away from reality in its tour through an america supposedly riven with disrepair and decay .", 
                "he also urged unification , saying he hoped to unlock the mysteries of space and heal our divisions .", 
                "it 's time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget : that whether we are black or brown or white , we all bleed the same red blood of patriots .", 
                "the new president signed an executive order to ease the burden of the repeal of the affordable care act .", 
                "republicans have promised to quickly dismantle the law , possibly leaving more than 20 million americans without healthcare and threatening to balloon deficits around the country .", 
                "trump 's order appears to anticipate those financial risks , yet urges prompt repeal .", 
                "thousands of protesters filled the streets of washington dc , in mostly peaceful demonstrations that contrasted sharply with the thin crowds watching the inaugural parade .", 
                "more than 200 people were arrested after sporadic violence broke out , when some protesters threw bricks and bottles at police and officers fired pepper spray and stinging projectiles in return .", 
                "there was also some vandalism , including a limousine set on fire .", 
                "washington braced for far larger protests planned for saturday , including a women 's march that expects more than 200,000 people .", 
                "initial analysis of crowd size , meanwhile , suggested that far more people attended obama 's 2009 inauguration than trump 's 2017 inauguration .", 
                "trump 's white house immediately put his priorities on the new site : policing and the military , manufacturing , trade and oil drilling , and america first .", 
                "immigrants around the us , with and without papers , braced for life under the new administration .", 
                "americans almost immediately petitioned trump to release his taxes and divest from his businesses .", 
                "the senate confirmed two retired generals to trump 's cabinet , james mattis and john kelly , to head the pentagon and department of homeland security , respectively .",
