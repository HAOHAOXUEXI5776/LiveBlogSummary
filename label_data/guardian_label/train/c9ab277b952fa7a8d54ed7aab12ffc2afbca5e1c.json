                "it was about welfare and the self-employed and , although it did not contain specific proposals , it did contain some important clues as to the approach that labour under jeremy corbyn will take to social security .", 
                "here are the key points .", 
                "abrahams said labour would ensure that self-employed workers got the same welfare protection as workers with conventional jobs .", 
                "the self-employed currently have very poor income protection to smooth the ups and downs of their small business likewise , the self-employed have no recourse to sick pay should they fall ill .", 
                "in a recent study by the then department for business , innovation and skills 30 % of self-employed workers cited 'not getting paid when ill ' as a key concern similarly , those who face longer term injury through accident , have little in the way of additional provision .", 
                "while employees can access industrial injury and disablement benefits , this is not currently extended to those working for themselves .", 
                "finally , the state has always played an important role in nurturing family life .", 
                "while the self-employed can access the maternity allowance , provision for new fathers , or for those wishing to adopt lags remains out of reach .", 
                "there is a clear precedent here for state support , one which needs to be realised there is clear and inherent injustice in the current system , and in our transformation of our social security system , labour will ensure parity for workers of differing status .", 
                "at a time when some employers are being exposed for imposing false self-employment on workers who should really be employed , any new policy needs to ensure that employment rights are respected .", 
                "abrahams said that this principle - equality between welfare provision for the employed and the self-employed - was one of five tests labour would apply when devising welfare policies for the self-employed .", 
                "the other four principles were : adequacy , fairness , responsibility and respect for the status quo she said that international experience suggested that there were three possible approaches to improving welfare support for the self-employed .", 
                "you could protect the self-employed through general social security arrangements , abraham said , citing denmark as a possible model .", 
                "alternatively you could have occupational schemes offering welfare protection for people in specific sectors , like farmers , as happened in germany , france and spain , she said .", 
                "or you could have a specific social insurance system for all self-employed workers , as they do in belgium , she said .", 
                "she said she wanted social security protection generally to become more generous .", 
                "after six years of tory rule , the adequacy of social security support has suffered a steep decline providing social security to the self-employed must form part of a wider shift to improve the adequacy of support , reflecting the contribution that we all make to the social security system over the course of our lives and ending the tories ' policies of destitution by design .",

                "she said labour would oppose any moves by the tories to expand the role of private insurance in welfare .", 
                "alarm bells should ring on moves to expand the role of private insurance into the social security system too .", 
                "we must see behind this thin veneer of compassionate rhetoric to the true motivations for this change .", 
                "by allowing wealthier workers to buy out of our collective approach to security into a privatised model of individual insurance , may 's government plans to erode public support for the principles of universalism and means testing in our social security system .", 
                "this would create political opportunities for continued attacks on the safety net which belongs to us all .", 
                "this seemed to be a reference to reports that theresa may wants to encourage people to take out new forms of social insurance .", 
                "nick timothy , may 's co-chief of staff , has also said in the past he would like welfare to be more contributions-based .",

                "expanding the contributory element in welfare was an idea tentatively explored by labour in the last parliament , but abrahams ' speech suggests corbyn is not interested .", 
                "she said : any policy to strengthen social security for the self-employed will seek to re-enforce the current mix of contribution , universalism and means-testing , without allowing one to dominate at the expense of the others .", 
                "she said that , while the increase in self-employment had been good for some workers , for others it had led to poverty pay .", 
                "since the 1980s the number of self-employed people has risen dramatically .", 
                "there are now nearly 5 million , accounting for 15 % of our workforce while self-employment can offer vast earning potential , it is a sad fact that the overall trend in recent years has been towards low pay .",
