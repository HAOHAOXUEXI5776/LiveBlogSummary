                "his intervention came as senior tories spent the day arguing about the legal status of the deal , with michael gove , the justice secretary , and dominic raab , the human rights minister , claiming the deal could by un by the european court of justice , but number 10 and jeremy wright , the attorney general , insisting it has proper legal force .",

                "is david cameron 's eu deal legally binding ?", 
                "it depends | joshua rozenberg read more david cameron has launched a highly personal attack on jeremy corbyn by saying that his mother would expect the labour leader to wear a proper suit , do up his tie and sing the national anthem .", 
                "corbyn has accused cameron of using misleading '' figures about the number of excess deaths there are in hospitals at weekends .", 
                "speaking at pmqs , he said : this dispute with the junior doctors has been on the basis of misrepresented research about weekend mortality .", 
                "i 'll read the prime minster what the researchers themselves say - 'it is not possible to ascertain the extent to which these excess deaths may be preventable , to assume that they are avoidable would be rash and misleading ' .", 
                "so are you and your health secretary being rash and misleading with these figures ?", 
                "in his reply , cameron said it was the bma that had been misleading , because it had publishing inaccurate information about the pay deal for junior doctors .", 
                "and he defended hunt , saying : now let me answer , very directly , the question about excess deaths .", 
                "the 6,000 figure for excess deaths was based on a question asked by the health secretary to sir bruce keogh , the medical director of the nhs .", 
                "now we have had time to go into these figures in more detail , i can tell you this - that the health secretary was indeed guilty .", 
                "he was guilty of an understatement .", 
                "the true figures for excess deaths at the weekend are 11,000 , not 6,000 , so perhaps you will now withdraw your totally unjustified attack on the health secretary ?", 
                "cameron ignored the point corbyn was making , which is that the researchers who produced the 11,000 figure said it would be misleading to suggest those deaths were caused by low staffing levels at weekends .",

                "leaving the european union would pay an \u00a3 18bn a year brexit dividend '' which would allow the uk to spend \u00a3 2bn on farming and the environment , farming minister , george eustice , has said .",

                "the eu referendum has split the department for environment , food and rural affairs ( defra ) , with environment secretary , liz truss , backing the campaign to remain , but her junior minister for food , farming and the marine environment declaring support for leaving the bloc .",

                "as the press association reports , it has begun a review that will see the number cut from 533 to 501 as part of a wider process by bodies in each part of the uk to slash the overall number of commons seats from 650 to 600 .",

                "michael gove is wrong about this .", 
                "it is quite plain that the treaty , the agreement that we have reached , has legal force .", 
                "it will have legal force from the day on which we indicated after a referendum that we wish to stay in the european union .", 
                "and thereafter the terms of the agreement can be raised in any court case where it is relevant , and the court would have to take it into account .", 
                "when today 's sarah montague put it to him that having to take account '' of the deal ( which is what number 10 says the european court of justice will have to do ) was not the same as being bound by it , he dismissed that as semantics '' .", 
                "he told her : all courts have to take into account and be bound by what is said .",

                "ultimately , michael gove 's problem appears to be that he just does n't trust the court .", 
                "one of the reasons why i thought the prime minister came back with rather a good deal is that he 's clarified a number of areas of the uk 's status within the eu in a way which i think is really very good .", 
                "i 've been arguing this for some time and was pleased to see it .",

                "it 's always possible that an interpretation of the treaty may turn out to be different from what the united kingdom may argue .",

                "as attorney general i was n't always satisfied with the conclusions that the [ ecj ] arrived at .", 
                "that 's why i thought on the two key issues of our special status outside of the eurozone and ever-closer union and the red card , the prime minister 's actually achieved something which is i thought well beyond my expectations in the negotiations , viewing it as a lawyer .", 
                "i 'm not surprised , therefore , that a number of other european countries have complained rather bitterly that the united kingdom has succeeded in getting itself a rather exceptional status .",
