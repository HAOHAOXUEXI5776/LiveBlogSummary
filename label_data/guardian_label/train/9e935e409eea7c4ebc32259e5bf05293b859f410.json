                "it was never likely that bradley would introduce it , and her comments in the chamber ( see , for example , what she said about peter preston 's column at 1.50pm ) suggest implementation is not a runner .", 
                "but she has also included the option of partially introducing part 40 - introducing the carrot '' ( exemption from costs for papers that lose a court case , if they are signed up to a leveson-compliant regulator ) but shelving the stick '' ( forcing papers to pay their opponents ' costs even if they win , if they are not signed up to a leveson-compliant regulator ) .",
