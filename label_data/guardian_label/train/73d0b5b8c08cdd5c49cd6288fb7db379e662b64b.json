                "cameron hinted that the government will reject a recommendation for ministers to lose their power to decide surveillance warrants .", 
                "a draft investigatory powers bill will be published on wednesday , and one of the issues ministers have had to decide is whether or not to accept the recommendation from david anderson , the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation , for judges , not ministers , to authorise surveillance warrants .", 
                "asked about whether judges or politicians should have the final say , cameron replied : i think politicians do have a role . ''", 
                "this appears to confirm reports that the bill will outline a two-stage approvals process in which a minister would give the initial authorisation for intercept warrants , followed by confirmation of that decision from a senior judge with security clearance .", 
                "cameron said the government needed to give the police and security services the power to monitor communications data .", 
                "as prime minister , i would just say to people , 'please let 's not have a situation where we give terrorists , criminals , child abducters safe spaces to communicate . '", 
                "it is not a safe space for them to communicate on a fixed-line telephone , or a mobile phone .", 
                "we should n't allow the internet to be a safe space for them to communicate and do bad things .", 
                "cameron said that the government was reviewing travel advice in the light of the sinai plane crash .", 
                "at the moment official travel advice said flying to sharm el-sheikh was safe , he said .", 
                "but he said a meeting was taking place at the same time as he was giving the interview to consider what was known about the crash .", 
                "if certain routes are n't safe , of course we will act .", 
                "but you have to act on the basis of evidence .", 
                "he rejected claims that the tax credit cuts showed that he did not care about the poor .", 
                "we do care .", 
                "and the most important thing is getting families into work , and having a strong and stable economy where we are able to provide good health and good schools and the rest of it .", 
                "he rejected a claim that he did not know families on the breadline .", 
                "when this was put to him , he replied : i do .", 
                "i 'm a constituency mp .", 
                "i have people coming to my surgery talking about their problems , their circumstances , how we can help .", 
                "he defended his decision to announce that he would not serve a third term .", 
                "i think that 10 years as prime ministers is a good , long time and after 10 years people will probably be happy to have another prime minister .", 
                "so i think it was the right decision .", 
                "he said that one of his plans to increase the number of children being adopted ( see 9.58am ) involved allowing people to foster , but to also apply to adopt at the same time .", 
                "he described this as concurrency '' , and said it could speed up the adoption process massively .",
