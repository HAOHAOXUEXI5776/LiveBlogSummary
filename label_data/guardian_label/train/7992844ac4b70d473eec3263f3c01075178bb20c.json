                "jeremy corbyn , the new labour leader , has already had a series of uncomfortable policy disputes with mps and shadow ministers - over europe , the benefits cap , and trident , for example - but today he is embroiled in what could be the biggest row yet .", 
                "yesterday john mcdonnell , the shadow chancellor and corbyn 's close ally , announced that he was abandoning the stance he took just last month and that he was now committing labour to voting against the government 's charter for budget responsibility .", 
                "at last night 's meeting of the parliamentary labour party ( plp ) there was a mighty backlash , leading to it being described as shambolic .", 
                "patrick wintour ( @ patrickwintour ) parliamentary labour party meeting described by one mp - not a blairite - as one of the worst he has ever seen - `` an incompetent shambles '' .", 
                "and this morning the backlash continues .", 
                "on the today programme chris leslie , who was shadow chancellor for a brief period after the election until corbyn 's election as leader , said the u-tun was sending out the wrong message '' to the public .", 
                "he said : to go from one extreme to the other is wrong in economic terms but also it sends the wrong message to the general public as well .", 
                "so , to be fair to john mcdonnell , this is a very difficult balancing act , it 's a very difficult to but it 's incredibly important that his is clear and consistent and explains fully not just what labour 's position is but why he backed george osborne 's surplus a couple of weeks ago and is now against it , apparently i ca n't explain why john went in favour of supporting and voting for george osborne 's strategy .", 
                "i personally think it would have been better to say , in principle , we support the concept of a surplus but if certain conditions , certain tests are passed .", 
                "for example , can we be certain that the viability of public services - our nhs , our national security - would be safe .", 
                "i will be covering more reaction to the u-turn as the day goes on .", 
                "here is the agenda for the day .", 
                "9.30am : the home office releases hate crime statistics .", 
                "11am : david cameron chairs a meeting of the community engagement forum .", 
                "around 12.40pm : mps start debating the second reading of the immigration bill .", 
                "2.30pm : chris grayling , the leader of the commons , gives evidence to the scottish affairs committee about english voters for english laws .", 
                "2.45pm : richard harrington , the minister for refugees , gives evidence to the commons home affairs committee .", 
                "as usual , i will also be covering breaking political news as it happens , as well as bringing you the best reaction , comment and analysis from the web .", 
                "i will post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon .", 
                "if you want to follow me or contact me on twitter , i 'm on @ andrewsparrow ."
