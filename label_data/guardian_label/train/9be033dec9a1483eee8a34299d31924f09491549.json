                "it gave me the idea that maybe if there was a commercial flight from anchorage , alaska , to honolulu , you 'd get the eclipse on the flight , says rao , who soon discovered that alaska airlines ' flight 870 flew daily from anchorage to honolulu .",

                "by rao 's calculations , the only way its passengers would be able to observe the eclipse in totality would be for the flight to leave half an hour later .",
