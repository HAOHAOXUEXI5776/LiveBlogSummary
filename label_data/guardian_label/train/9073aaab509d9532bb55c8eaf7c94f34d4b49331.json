                "we 're better off without it , netanyahu said , calling for the us to overhaul its negotiations with iran .", 
                "he said that besides a military option the alternative is a much better deal .", 
                "the proposed deal does n't block iran 's path to the bomb , it paves iran 's path to the bomb , netanyahu said , arguing that inspectors could not stop iran from violating rules , that the agreement would leave much of iran 's nuclear infrastructure intact , and that it would lift restrictions on the program in a decade .", 
                "president barack obama dismissed netanyahu 's speech as nothing new , and the white house insisted the proposed deal represents the best possible way to confront the threat from iran 's nuclear program .",

                "even after the period of the agreement , it would remain ( unlike israel ) a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty ( npt ) and to a safeguards agreement with the iaea , which involves constant monitoring aimed at insuring the nuclear programme is not used for military ends .", 
                "repurposing a huge number of centrifuges from making low enriched uranium to weapons-grade uranium , would be very complicated and would most likely take months to carry out effectively .",

                "but in the context of the same kind of regime in tehran and the same degree of volatility in the middle east , it would mean a return to tension and uncertainty , once the agreement had lapsed ."
