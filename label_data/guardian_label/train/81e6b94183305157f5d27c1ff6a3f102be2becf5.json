                "nearly 200 countries have subsequently pledged to reach agreement in paris at the end of 2015 on a climate pact for carbon cuts beyond 2020 .", 
                "ban 's meeting today is n't part of those official climate talks ( run by the unfccc ) but is meant as a chance for governments , cities and business to show some ambition on tackling climate change .", 
                "ban says the summit has two goals : to mobilise political will for a universal and meaningful climate agreement next year in paris ; and second to generate ambitious steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and strengthen resilience the summit comes just two days after marches around the world , from melbourne to manhattan , calling for leaders today to make bold commitments on climate change .",
