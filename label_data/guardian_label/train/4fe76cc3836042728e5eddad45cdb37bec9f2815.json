                "fallon said attacks are not part of normal life but london was clearly a target police were preparing for the current warning is at severe - that an attack - and that has been the case for sometime , is likely but not imminent .", 
                "there is no specific information about other attacks and let me emphasise today although there is intense security around palace of westminster , london is going to work this morning , i passed school children going to school , there are school trips going ahead , parliament itself will resume at the normal time at half past nine .", 
                "fallon said it was not the case that police could not prevent low tech attacks but admitted it was more difficult .", 
                "the police and agencies that we rely on for our security have forestalled a large number of these attacks in recent years over a dozen last year .", 
                "now of course this kind of attack , this lone wolf attack , things from daily life - a vehicle , a knife are much more difficult to forestall - and we are dealing with a terrorist enemy that is not making demands or holding people hostage but just to kill as many people as possible .", 
                "this is a new element to international terrorism but our forces are working extremely hard to identify those that are involved to this and i have every confidence they will be able to track down the associates of this particular man .", 
                "fallon said police had to work on the assumption others may have helped prepare the attack .", 
                "the police have to proceed on the presumption that he may well have been assisted in this task - there may have been others involved - they have been working right through the night looking into his background , how he got hold of vehicle and who or where the vehicle has been in the last day or two and he may or may not have been helped .", 
                "he also insists it is not the case that the security of parliament was breached , and that is down to the bravery of pc keith palmer at carriage gate .", 
                "in paying tribute to pc keith palmer , they did not get into parliament , they only got as far as the gate , they did not breach the security of the house of commons - he gave his life to protect our democracy .", 
                "parliament can not be hermetically sealed , people are coming and going all the time , there was a division in place in the house of commons at that time - people arriving at the gates by car or foot to vote on that .", 
                "but obviously this is something that will be reviewed by the house authorities .", 
                "fallon also said the cabinet had reviewed at the cobr meeting whether the metropolitan police had all the resources they need , including military back-up to deal with situations like that .", 
                "there have been increases in the budgets of security services - we will continue to keep that under review .",
