                "as ireland 's taoiseach pointed out months ago , that means flags , guns and checkpoints : via @ twitterid hammond , the chancellor , told mps that the uk and the eu needed to agree a transition deal by april because otherwise airlines would not be able to schedule flights with certainty for april next year .", 
                "he told the european scrutiny committee : the implementation period is in our view very much in the interest of both sides - to create some certainty to allow businesses to plan - to deal with immediate pressing issues .",

                "he said : as and when it becomes clear that we can discount as reasonably unlikely any of the options - for example , once we reach an implementation period deal - i would expect that we would then be able to stand down planning for a no deal exit in 2019 .", 
                "he said it was possible that the uk and the eu could agree a transition but then fail to reach a deal on a long-term partnership .",

                "he said : we have no plans to make provision for extension , and i expect that , because of what the european union has said , the structure of the implementation period will have a fixed end-date in the agreement that we reach with the european union .",

                "it 's being spent on ensuring that we are prepared for a full range of outcomes .",
