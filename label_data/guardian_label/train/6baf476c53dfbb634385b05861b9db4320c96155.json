                "as donald trump attempted some damage control after losing the wisconsin primary by 13 points and bernie sanders raised the stakes in an increasingly bitter democratic primary by calling opponent hillary clinton not qualified to be president , the state of the race showed that inter-party rancor has infected both the democratic and republican presidential hopefuls .",
