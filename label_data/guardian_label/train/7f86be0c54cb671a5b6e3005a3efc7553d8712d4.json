                "britain 's laws governing the intelligence agencies and mass surveillance require a total overhaul to make them more transparent , comprehensible and up to date , the intelligence and security committee of parliament ( isc ) has said in a landmark report prompted by the revelations of edward snowden , the former us national security agency ( nsa ) contractor .", 
                "there is a summary of the findings in the report here .", 
                "mps have backed a call for defence spending to be set at a minimum of 2 % of gdp , the nato target , although only 40 members of the commons took part in the vote .", 
                "some 37 mps voted in favour of the backbench motion tabled by the conservative mp john baron , and only 3 mps voted against .", 
                "in the debate sir malcolm rifkind , the conservative former foreign secretary and former defence secretary , said further defence cuts would result in profound and irreversible change '' to the uk 's defence capability and ability to conduct a global foreign policy with authority and credibility '' .", 
                "of course the figure of 2 % is a nominal figure .", 
                "it 's a totem .", 
                "it 's the actual real resources that are important .", 
                "but i do find it difficult , if not impossible , to reconcile a cavalier approach towards the 2 % objective , which we 've held for very many years , while at the same time saying overseas development is somehow untouchable and has got statutory protection of a kind i find quite extraordinary if you are seen as having once had that military capability but having as an option , as a deliberate act of government policy , chose to reduce that capability , so that it still remains significant but not in any profound sense impressive , then you have seriously reduced your diplomatic clout and you have made the ultimate problems that much greater .", 
                "it 's always dangerous to make comparisons with the 1930s , but we know perfectly well that those in berlin who were planning aggression believed that the western democracies were incapable of providing the resources required for strong defence and that influenced their foreign policy .", 
                "and rory stewart , the conservative chair of the commons defence committee , said defence spending needed to be kept at at least 2 % of gdp because previous defence assumptions no longer applied .", 
                "the world has changed fundamentally .", 
                "those assumptions we worked on were essentially developed on two bases .", 
                "firstly , that the cold war had ended ; secondly , that essentially what we will be doing in the future was the kind of things that were happening in 2010 , primarily afghanistan .", 
                "that basically meant we were planning to go in for a very long time with very large number of troops into a single country , or at most , in the us , planning two countries at a time .", 
                "but the world has changed completely .", 
                "firstly we have a return to a threat from a conventional state with an advanced military capacity , which is russia .", 
                "that reshapes the entire assumption from 1998 to 2010 .", 
                "secondly , we now have concurrent threats .", 
                "winding up for the government , philip dunne , a conservative defence minister said the government would hit the 2 % target this financial year and next year and that , after that , this would be a matter for the spending review .", 
                "baron said he was putting the matter to a vote because neither the conservatives nor labour were making a clear commitment to keep defence spending at the 2 % level .", 
                "the leaders of britain 's three main political parties have closed ranks to condemn nigel farage after the ukip leader called for the scrapping of the bulk of britain 's anti-discrimination laws .", 
                "a former liberal democrat chief fundraiser has stood down as a parliamentary candidate for the party after he was caught on tape allegedly advising a fake donor on how to circumvent funding laws .", 
                "the use of cocaine in the uk has more than trebled in two decades and is no longer the the preserve of wealthy bankers and celebrities '' , a report has found .", 
                "as the press association has reported , the advisory council on the misuse of drugs said the drug has spread throughout all areas of society since the mid-1990s following the emergence of a market in cheap , low-purity powdered cocaine that operates alongside a more expensive and far higher purity version of the drug .", 
                "the access to cheap cocaine - often mixed with harmful cutting agents - is highly likely '' to have driven the rise in the number of users from hard pressed '' or low income backgrounds , as well as the comfortably off '' , living outside cities where drug use was traditionally uncommon .", 
                "but more surprising to authors was the phenomenon '' of older people up to the age of 54 using cocaine - a trend not seen in other drug types .", 
                "mark carney , the governor of the bank of england , has warned of the need to be vigilant '' against the risk that low inflation slips in to the kind of spiral of falling prices behind the great depression in the 1930s .", 
                "as the press association reports , carney said if factors weighing on it such as the strong pound , and weakness in overseas ' economies strengthen , the path of interest rates may need to change - apparently hinting that they could rise more slowly than expected or even be cut .", 
                "a green candidate has announced that his party has no plans to make further defence spending cuts - apparently contradicting statements on its own website .", 
                "that 's all from me for today .", 
                "i 'm not blogging tomorrow - we 'll be running a readers ' edition - but i will be blogging from the lib dem conference in liverpool over the weekend , as well as including ed miliband 's speech in birmingham on saturday and george osborne and ed balls ' pre-budget appearance on the andrew marr show on sunday ."
