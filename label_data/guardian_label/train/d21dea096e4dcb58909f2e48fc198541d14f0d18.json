                "it 's the morning after the historic night before , and greece and its creditors are considering their next steps after the country failed to make a \u20ac1.5bn payment due to the international monetary fund , pushing it closer to default , and its bailout ran out without agreement .", 
                "the eurogroup is holding at teleconference at 10.30am bst to discuss greece 's request for a third bailout , after the country asked for a new two year programme under the european stability mechanism ( europe 's bailout fund ) .", 
                "jeroen dijsselbloem ( @ j dijsselbloem ) eurogroup teleconference wednesday 11:30am , to discuss state of play # greece but eurozone finance ministers have already warned such a path would be difficult , and france 's finance minister michel sapin said it would be incredibily complicated '' , especially with the looming greek referendum on sunday .", 
                "as reuters reports : 01-jul-2015 06:50:24 - france 's finmin says goal for france is to find a deal before the referendum in greece 01-jul-2015 06:51:31 - french finmin says obviously incredibly complicated to get deal with greece 01-jul-2015 06:52:04 - french finmin says toughest line is among small eu countries 01-jul-2015 06:55:37 - french finmin michel sapin says no vote brings risk of move towards greek exit of euro zone meanwhile the european central bank is meeting - believed to be around 11.00 bst - to discuss whether to continue providing emergency support to greek banks .", 
                "the fact that a third bailout is being discussed might give the ecb the necessary cover to continue support albeit with perhaps tougher terms on collateral .", 
                "michael hewson , chief market analyst at cmc markets uk , said : the european central bank will meet to assess the latest ela arrangements which could well be tightened in light of yesterday 's non-payment to the imf .", 
                "while it is not expected that the ecb will end the program , they could well raise the collateral haircuts , in exchange for emergency funding .", 
                "there is a risk that this might place more strain on the weaker members of the greek banking system and tip some of the weaker banks over the edge , leaving the ecb open to the accusation of further asphyxiating liquidity as well as political interference , which leaves it in a tricky position , and suggests that they will probably err on the side of caution and do nothing .", 
                "as guardian of financial stability the sensible option would be to do nothing , despite further ratings agency downgrades for greece last night , this time from fitch to one rank above default .", 
                "for those wanting to catch up with yesterday 's events , here is our report : greek failure to make imf payment deals historic blow to eurozone read more and here is the story from my colleague alberto nardelli on secret documents showing the full extent of greece 's debt problems : greece would face an unsustainable level of debt by 2030 even if it signs up to the full package of tax and spending reforms demanded of it , according to unpublished documents compiled by its three main creditors ."
