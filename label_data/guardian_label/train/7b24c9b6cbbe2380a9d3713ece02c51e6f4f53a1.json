                "he appeared to go further than labour 's usual stance on the subject of health service pay , which until now has simply been that they will honour whatever recommendations the independent nhs pay review body makes .", 
                "it potentially commits the party to an expensive policy as the nhs in england employs 1.3m people and staff pay already accounts for about 60 % of its annual \u00e2\u00a3 115bn budget .", 
                "the health minister norman lamb , the liberal democrats ' health spokesman , immediately questioned the affordability of burnham 's pledge , given that the nhs 's finances are in poor shape and also because labour have refused to join the lib dems and tories in committing to giving the nhs the extra \u00e2\u00a3 8bn in funding that nhs england boss simon stevens has asked for in order to safeguard the service 's future .", 
                "the issue arose at the hustings when dr mark porter , the leader of the british medical association , asked the four politicians - including health secretary jeremy hunt and ukip 's dr julia reid - if staff would face more real-terms pay cuts in the next parliament .", 
                "asked by bbc today programme 's sarah montague if he could commit to real-terms pay increases , burnham replied : yes , i can .", 
                "and we would reinstate the independent pay review body stood down by jeremy hunt .", 
                "burnham criticised hunt for the coalition promising all nhs staff an across the board 1 % pay rise , which the pay review body had judged to be affordable , but that was [ then ] reneged on .", 
                "he also claimed that nhs staff are being kicked in the teeth by seeing more money going on agency staff , sums - estimated to be \u00e2\u00a3 2.5bn a year - he also described as fortunes .", 
                "lamb , who said the nhs 's spend on agency nurses was and always had been excessive , questioned how labour would fund burnham 's commitment , especially as it had only committed to giving the nhs an extra \u00e2\u00a3 2.5bn a year through its planned time to care fund to hire extra doctors .", 
                "nurses and midwives .", 
                "however , he and hunt said that the nhs could not expect to continue holding down staff pay , as has happened over the last five years as staff have had pay freezes or only 1 % rises , because of its need to continue attracting people to work for it .", 
                "they both ruled out the nhs using further pay restraint to help it make the \u00e2\u00a3 22bn of extra efficiency savings a year it has committed to find by 2020 .", 
                "hunt said that not giving all staff the 1 % pay rise was probably the hardest decision he had had to make in his two and a half years as health secretary , but that he had been advised that awarding it would lead to between 6,000 and 14,000 nurses losing their jobs .", 
                "while his principle if he continued as health secretary would be to pay staff as generously as possible , any rises should not mean that hospital trusts and other nhs providers of care had to lay off staff .", 
                "update : apologies , i conveyed andy burnham 's pledges from earlier today on potential pay increases for the nhs 's 1.3m staff in england a bit wrongly .", 
                "what burnham committed labour to was an end to the policy of real-terms pay cuts for nhs personnel which health unions say has seen their income drop by an estimated 10 % under the coalition - which , on my interpretation , would mean a return to the sorts of inflation-proof annual pay increases that the nhs workforce used to get .", 
                "sarah montague actually asked him can you commit to no real-terms pay cuts ? , not what i reported earlier ( can you commit to real-terms pay increases ? ) .", 
                "it was to that question that the shadow health secretary replied yes , i can , before emphasising that he wanted to see fairness in pay from the bottom to the top .", 
                "health unions are this afternoon getting anxious about something else said about earnings at the debate - jeremy hunt 's refusal to rule out continuing with the coalition 's policy of real-terms pay cuts as part of the nhs 's drive to somehow find the \u00e2\u00a3 22bn of efficiency savings it has pledged to deliver by 2020 as part of a deal that would see it receive \u00e2\u00a3 8bn extra from the treasury every year .", 
                "asked will you promise no more real-terms pay cuts ? , hunt replied : i ca n't make that commitment now because i do n't know the full situation .", 
                "my principle is i want to be as generous as possible provided no decision i take as health secretary means we would end up having fewer doctors and nurses .", 
                "we are committing to a bigger real terms increase [ in the nhs 's overall budget , of \u00e2\u00a3 8bn a year more by 2020 ] than any other party .", 
                "the chances of giving a better pay deal are higher given that we 've committed to \u00e2\u00a3 10bn effectively towards the forward view .",

                "but those concessions could also have the effect of making labour popular in scotland .",

                "major addressed this in the q & a ( see below ) , but not particularly effectively .",

                "i started warning about this in the early 1990s .", 
                "that 's hardly a johnny-come-lately attitude to a problem that has arisen .", 
                "and the reason it has arisen now is not because of anything any conservative has said .", 
                "it is because of the growth in scottish nationalist support in scotland , labour 's collapse in scotland and the apparent likelihood that the scottish nationalists will have 40 or more seats in the house of commons when they are still a separatist party .", 
                "any unionist like me has an absolute duty to point out to the country the risk that we ae facing and for labour to twist that round in some other fashion , as i gather they are doing , just takes us back to the worst sort of 1990s labour spin , and i think we all these days have contempt for that .", 
                "he rejected claims that he was delegitimising the snp .", 
                "asked about this , he responded : i wonder how many people here are voting to have the snp running our government when they would have about 5 % members of the house of commons at most and when their leader is n't even running in the election to be a member of the house of commons .", 
                "if you would like to talk about delegitimising , i would like to know what someone who is n't even a candidate for the house of commons is doing talking about her party changing the policy and politics of the government of the whole of the united kingdom .",
