                "bill shorten has addressed one hundred swinging voters in the government 's most marginal electorate , the queensland seat of petrie .", 
                "shorten used the opportunity to outline labor 's messages on health and schools and climate change , and held out the prospect of more investment in childcare , action to ensure health consumers did n't face extensive out of pocket costs for procedures like pathology screening , stomping on the private health insurance industry to contain premium increases , more government intervention to keep industries in australia like the steel industry , and potential subsidies to employers to encourage them to hire more mature aged workers .", 
                "the labor leader said he made no apologies for being nationalistic about australian jobs .", 
                "he told voters at the forum labor had learned from the last period in government : it had learned to be united , it had learned to produce costed policies , and it had learned to seek a mandate from voters by clearly outlining policy alternatives .", 
                "there was also a mildly random punchbowl analogy but i do n't think you are missing much by me failing to explain that one .", 
                "the labor leader faced no questions about negative gearing , about asylum boats , about budget repair ( except one question which referred in general terms to labor 's economic management ) , about labor 's relationship with trade unions suggesting voters ( at least this group ) are n't really up on the government 's key attack lines against labor .", 
                "if i were the government i 'd be a bit concerned about that , but it is only one small sample of voters .", 
                "an exit poll taken after the event suggested 68 % of participants at the people 's forum are more likely to vote labor than they were before this evening , 9 % were less likely and 23 % were undecided .", 
                "that 's about the long and short of it .", 
                "i 'll be back in live mode when federal parliament resumes on april 18 , if not before .",
