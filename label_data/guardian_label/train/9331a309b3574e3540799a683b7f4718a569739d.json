                "retailer philip green .", 
                "that was the longest and most confrontational parliamentary session i 've covered over the last decade .", 
                "sir philip green went into the grilling vowing to put his side of the story , and he took every opportunity to do so interrupting mps , refusing to answer questions he did n't fancy , and taking criticism extremely badly .", 
                "broadly , his position is that some mistakes were made , but it 's not really his fault .", 
                "he does n't want to blame anyone else , but managed to blame pretty much everyone who had a role in this fiasco - advisers , the pension regulator and even journalists .", 
                "he seemed particularly irked with city firms olswang and grant thornton for representing dominic chappell , suggesting they provided a sheen of respectability .", 
                "that 's a pretty poor excuse for not realising that the ex-bankrupt racing driver might not be the best person to buy bhs .", 
                "green did at least apologise , nice and early in the session , and admit he should never have sold the company to chappell for \u00e2\u00a3 1 .", 
                "but he also claimed that recent criticism was wholly unfair , and even blamed envy and jealousy for the dividends which moved from bhs to his luxury base in monaco .", 
                "green is entitled to his point of view , but perhaps he should save the lectures until the bhs pension deficit has been fixed .", 
                "the committee struggled to land many punches on green over the financial details of the bhs farrago .", 
                "that 's because the arcadia chief had a two-pronged strategy ; he either produced his own figures to challenge the mps , or claimed he simply did n't get involved with whatever they were asking about .", 
                "for example , the sale of bhs 's ealing store to his stepson .", 
                "instead , green preferred to focus on other wrong-doing - such as chappell 's apparent breach of the covenants set up to protect bhs .", 
                "green did have the excuse that his wife , lady christina , actually owns arcadia 's assets .", 
                "did the committee call the wrong green ?", 
                "perhaps tina should sail one of the family 's yachts up the thames and testify herself ashley armstrong ( @ aarmstrong says ) boom !", 
                "iain wright just hinted that he will be calling lady tina green for evidence on bhs corporate governance bhs pensioners did get one piece of good news - green 's pledge to address the pension black hole .", 
                "he said : i want to give an assurance to the 20,000 [ bhs ] pensioners that i am there to sort this , in the correct way .", 
                "however , green did not promise to ensure they would receive their full entitlement ; instead , it might just be better than taking a cut in the payment protection fund .", 
                "green was also rather hazy about how the scheme fell into such a mess , insisting that he 'd not bled the company dry but had actually invested capital in it .", 
                "green 's aggressive attitude seemed to stun mps at first ; he slammed one member for excessive staring , and snarled i ca n't deal with this when asked a pretty fair question about whether he 'd deliberately offloaded bhs 's pension liabilities .", 
                "after a while they began to suspect that it might hold the key to the crisis .", 
                "the committee may well conclude that the bhs disaster might have been averted if arcadia 's chairman had been more open to criticism .", 
                "a corporate governance problem , indeed .", 
                "green also showed that he 's not at the cutting edge of technology we got a glimpse of his antiquated nokia mobile phone , after he failed to turn it off following a break .", 
                "some younger viewers may have been baffled by the small booklet he waved at mps at one stage ; that 's called a cheque book , kids .", 
                "and green may well have to get it out again , and write a nine-figure sum to patch up the black hole in bhs 's pension .",
