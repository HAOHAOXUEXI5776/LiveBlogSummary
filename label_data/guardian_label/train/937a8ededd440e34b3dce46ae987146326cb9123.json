                "that speculation was heightened after former snp deputy leader jim sillars , who takes a fundamentalist stance on independence but has little influence over the current party leadership , told the telegraph a referendum would be on line one '' of next year 's snp manifesto for the 2016 holyrood elections .", 
                "facing heavy and wounding losses to the snp in the election , and watching the snp adopt many of its key pledges , scottish labour has gone deliberately negative in the final week of the campaign by playing up fears of another referendum in its final campaign poster , unveiled in glasgow on thursday morning by leader jim murphy .",

                "humphrys later challenged alexander on claims in the times that nick clegg will face huge resistance from senior figures within the liberal democrats if he tries to push through a second coalition deal with the conservatives ( here - paywall ) .",
