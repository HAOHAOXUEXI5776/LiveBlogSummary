                "an international agreement generally limits airline liability to around us $ 157,400 ( \u00e2\u00a3 105,000 , au $ 200,000 ) for each passenger who dies in a crash if families do not sue , but if families want to pursue compensation for greater damages , they can file lawsuits .", 
                "lawyers who have represented families in past airline disasters told reuters on thursday that potential lawsuits could focus on whether germanwings properly screened the co-pilot before and during his employment , and on whether the airline should have had a policy requiring two or more people in cockpits at all times during a flight .",
