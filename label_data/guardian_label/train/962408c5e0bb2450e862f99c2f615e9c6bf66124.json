                "here 's our report on the imf 's greek comments ahead of tuesday 's eurogroup meeting .", 
                "larry elliott writes : the international monetary fund called for upfront and unconditional debt relief for greece as it warned that without immediate action the financial plight of the recession-ravaged country would deteriorate dramatically over the coming decades .", 
                "in a strongly-worded assessment , the fund said that there was no prospect of greece meeting the draconian terms of its current bail-out plan and that debt interest payments on the soaring national debt would eat up 60 % of the budget by 2060 in the absence of debt forgiveness .", 
                "the debt sustainability analysis by the washington-based imf said greece should have longer to pay , have the interest rate on its loans fixed at 1.5 % , and that its creditors should make debt relief automatic once the bail out programme ends in 2018 .", 
                "the implementation of debt relief should be completed by the end of the program period , the imf said .", 
                "providing an upfront unconditional component to debt relief is critical to provide a strong and credible signal to markets about the commitment of official creditors to ensuring debt sustainability , which in itself could contribute to lowering market financing costs .", 
                "an upfront component can also help garner more ownership for reforms .", 
                "the hard-hitting nature of the report makes it clear to the eu that the imf will not be prepared to put its own money into the \u0082\u00ac86bn bail out unless germany and other eurozone countries ease their hardline stance towards greece .", 
                "on that note it 's time to close for the evening .", 
                "thanks for all your comments , and we 'll be back tomorrow ."
