                "overall , it was pretty solid .", 
                "it was n't an exciting or a flashy speech , and it not have anything new to say on policy , but it was coherent , serious and wide-ranging .",

                "( interestingly , he finds it easier to get enthusiastic about business when discussing it through the prism of multiculturalism .", 
                "there was a line in the speech , which was n't in the text made public , where he urged the audience to reflect on the huge opportunities that many bme communities , black and minority ethnic communities , have only had because they were able to open a small business , innovate and develop '' .", 
                "the labour mp simon danczuk noticed a similar trait when he had a private meeting with corbyn last year , which he subsequently wrote up for the mail on sunday . )", 
                "there was also a political vision within the speech .", 
                "corbyn argued that the economic orthodoxy of the past had failed , and he made the case for a strategic state '' , with government intervention and investment being deployed to boost growth .", 
                "in many respects this is similar to what ed miliband and ed balls are calling for in the last parliament , although corbyn went further on the banks ( balls would never describe them as an extractive industry '' ) and he also spoke up for collective bargaining , a cause that miliband and balls were more cautious about championing .", 
                "the extracts from the speech released overnight included specific criticism of new labour '' .", 
                "surprisingly , corbyn chose to tone this passage down a bit .",

                "the reference to supporting the case for britain staying in the eu was so brief that one colleague in the audience actually missed it .", 
                "this will reinforce sus that corbyn personally has little enthusiasm for campaigning for britain to remain in the eu , which is something that should worry david cameron , given the fact that he needs labour supporters to vote for in .",

                "he toned down criticism of new labour for contributing to the financial crash by not regulating the banks firmly enough .", 
                "in extracts from the speech released overnight he said : it was n't government that was the problem in 2007 and 2008 , when the banking sector nearly drove the entire economy to the point of collapse .", 
                "the new labour approach was to opt for 'light touch regulation ' of finance - and then sit back and collect the tax revenues .",

                "and we can not outsource economic policy to the city of london .", 
                "that has not served our economy well , and it has not served business well .",

                "he offered only lukewarm support for britain remaining in the eu .", 
                "there was only a cursory reference to labour 's support for britain 's membership of the eu in the speech , which was surprising because the eu referendum has been the dominant issue in british politics for the last fortnight , and it is one of particular interest to a business audience .", 
                "corbyn said : we should be laying the foundations for a modern economy now .", 
                "that applies not only within states but between states too ; climate change , the refugee crisis , raising standards for workers and consumers and dealing with the minority of companies that seek to avoid their taxes these are all issues that can only be resolved by working with our partners in europe , not ditching them .", 
                "this is why we are campaigning to remain in the eu because we believe , like 60 per cent of businesses the bcc surveyed , that the eu is the best framework for trade and cooperation in the 21st century .",
