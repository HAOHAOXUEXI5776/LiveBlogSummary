                "philip hammond , the foreign secretary , has said that that the british security services are studying the gun attack on the canadian parliament to see what the implications are for westminster .", 
                "giving evidence to the intelligence and security committee he said : our agencies are in close contact with their canadian counterparts and , as you would expect , are already analysing what happened in canada and the implications for us .", 
                "he said that the intelligence agencies were the exact opposite '' of their movie counterparts when it came to respecting privacy .", 
                "there were robust '' legal safeguards to limit what surveillance they could carry out , and multiple layers of oversight , he said .", 
                "but there was also a culture of caution .", 
                "there 's also a very important safeguard provided by the culture within the agencies , which is the exact opposite of what some movies might like to suggest .", 
                "the agencies are extremely cautious , extremely focused on their responsibility to maintain the culture of proportionality and necessity in everything they do .", 
                "and there is an atmosphere in the agencies which is very far from a gung-ho approach .", 
                "it is very cautious , very measured .", 
                "he said ministers who sign surveillance warrants all now believe that one day they will have to justify their actions before an iraq-style inquiry .", 
                "this meant there was a very strong political incentive '' to authorise surveillance only where it was justified , he said .", 
                "perhaps it is a feature of the times that we live in , but i 'm sure i can speak for all of my colleague who sign warrants that we all have , in the back of our minds , that at some point in the future we will - not might be , but will - be appearing before some inquiry or tribunal or court accounting for the decisions that we 've made and essentially accounting for the way we 've applied the proportionality and necessity tests .", 
                "there is a very strong political incentive in the system to apply these tests narrowly and in a way that minimises the scope of the agencies to interpret warrants that are issuesd .", 
                "he said this was why he thought it was better for politicians to sign intercept warrants , not judges .", 
                "judges would only be concerned about the legality of a warrant , whereas politicians had to taken into account the political need for proportionality too , he said .", 
                "he said he did not accept the claim that bulk data collection amounted to mass surveillance .", 
                "intrusion only took place when a particular item of data was actually investigated , he said .", 
                "he said there were strict legal safeguards that determined when this was allowed to happen .", 
                "but he also that a country like britain simply did not have the resources to examine all the data it collected in that kind of intrusive manner .", 
                "jeremy hunt , the health secretary , and andy burnham , his labour opposite number , have both claimed that a report on the future of the nhs vindicates their party 's stance on health policy .", 
                "see 12.29pm .", 
                "simon stevens , the nhs england chief executive , has defended the privatisation of services as a way of helping patients get treatment but insisted that the health service would continue to do most of the work .", 
                "ed miliband has promised he will introduce an immigration reform bill within a month of winning the next election that offers clear , credible and concrete '' measures to deal with the concerns of voters .", 
                "mps , including former coalition ministers who have since returned to the backbenches , have declared more than \u00a3 7.1m earnings from second jobs and outside interests , according to parliamentary records .", 
                "as james ball and harry davies report , an analysis by the guardian shows that 26 mps declared more earnings from directorships , paid employment or shareholdings than they did from their parliamentary salary , with more than 20 declaring more than \u00a3 100,000 in outside earnings in the latest register of members ' interests .", 
                "one of the top earners is charles hendry , who was until september 2012 a minister of state at the department of energy and climate change .", 
                "nick clegg has backed fiona woolf as the chair of the government 's inquiry into child sex abuse , saying she was a credible person '' for the role .", 
                "the work and pension selection committee has announced n inquiry into how the benefit sanctions regime is administered .",
