                "a poll released this afternoon from wsj and nbc has found that the contest between donald trump and ted cruz to be republican presidential nominee appears closer than previously thought , writes guardian us data editor mona chalabi : the national poll , which was conducted with just 397 respondents between march 3 and 6 , found that trump has the support of 30 % of republican primary voters - 3 percentage points ahead of ted cruz and 8 percentage points ahead of kasich ( who , after months of polling in single digits , appears to have grown in popularity in the past week ) .", 
                "marco rubio was in fourth place with just 20 % of respondents selecting him as their first choice for republican nominee .",
