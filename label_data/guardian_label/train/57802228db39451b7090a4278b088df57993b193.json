                "the cia and white house had tried to block some or all of the report .", 
                "the report contained a substantial amount of never-before-revealed information about the bush-era torture program , including the number of cia detainees ( 119 ) , certain techniques ( rectal feeding and hydration ) and new details in cases of specific detainees .", 
                "key findings of the report , as presented by intelligence committee chairwoman dianne feinstein ( video ) , included that the cia 's \u0080\u0098enhanced interrogation techniques ' were not effective and the cia 's management of the program was inadequate and deeply flawed .",
