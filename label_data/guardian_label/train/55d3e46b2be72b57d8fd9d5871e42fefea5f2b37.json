                "gillard has denied allegations by previous witnesses , athol james , wayne hems and ralph blewitt , that her renovations were funded by wilson using money from the union slush fund .", 
                "in 1995 , i took steps to satisfy myself that looking at the amount of work that had been performed on my home , that i had paid for it all .",
