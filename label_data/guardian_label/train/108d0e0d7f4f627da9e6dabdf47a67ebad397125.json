                "fitch warn : businesses are facing a surge in uncertainty on three separate fronts - the future of the uk 's trading relationship with the eu , the shape of the regulatory framework , and domestic political uncertainty , including the future status of scotland .", 
                "this uncertainty will prompt firms to delay investment and hiring decisions , while elevated financial market volatility will further damage business confidence .", 
                "and this means that the uk economy will be much weaker than expected .", 
                "here 's the key points : we expect investment to fall by 5 % in 2017 and by 2018 for it to be 15 % lower than previously expected in fitch 's may 2016 global economic outlook ( geo ) .", 
                "overall spending by uk residents will see a mild decline in 2017 .", 
                "the sharp fall in the value of sterling will provide some offset to the demand shock , with exports likely to benefit somewhat in the near term .", 
                "imports look likely to decline as investment contracts and foreign products become more expensive , resulting in expenditure switching to domestically produced goods and services and higher inflation .", 
                "uk gdp growth is expected to fall to around 1 % in both 2017 and 2018 .", 
                "this is a downward revision of 1 percentage point in each year from the may 2016 geo .", 
                "fitch point out that the long-term effects are harder to predict , partly because no-one knows what relationship the uk will have with the european union .", 
                "but they do n't expect much of a brexit dividend : in addition to less favourable access to the european single market , reductions in trade openness and inward foreign direct investment could harm productivity performance , while reduced immigration would slow labour supply and potential gdp .",
