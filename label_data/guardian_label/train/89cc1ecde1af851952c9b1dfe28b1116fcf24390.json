                "in the spring , around the time philip hammond was preparing his first budget , some of those close to him suggested that the march budget was never intended to be that special because he was saving his big , structural changes for the autumn .", 
                "since then , the world has moved on somewhat and he came to the commons today having made little impact with pre-budget announcements and with the expectation bar at what seemed like a treasury all-time low .", 
                "it felt as if he would be doing well not mess up .", 
                "and actually , by those criteria , he has succeeded .", 
                "the budget was well received by his colleagues and , so far , nothing has fully unravelled .", 
                "true , the office for budget responsibility has exposed his main headline-grabbing measure , the abolition of stamp duty for first-time buyers for homes worth up to \u00a3 300,000 , as a \u00a3 600m gimmick that will just push up prices .", 
                "but , even though it would be nice to live in a world where bad policy always amounts to bad politics , sadly we do n't , and it is hard to see hammond suffering any penalty for his home owner subsidy ( apart from when he realises he has not got \u00a3 600m to spend on something else ) .", 
                "the tory tribe ( mps and newspapers ) will never complain about a tax cut , and it is not a measure that will be voted down in the commons .", 
                "( for example , we ca n't even be sure labour will vote against it . )", 
                "otherwise , it was a mildly expansionist budget , with hammond turning the taps on to the value of \u00a3 9bn just as the uk is leaving the eu .", 
                "the tory brexiters who view hammond with sus will like the extra money for hard brexit contingency planning .", 
                "hammond did a bit to allay concerns about universal credit .", 
                "and there was some more money for the nhs .", 
                "not enough , nhs england say , and hammond 's failure to even mention social care shows that this was not a budget with long-term ambition .", 
                "but it will probably see him through .",

                "and we will extend the repayment period for advances from 6 months to 12 months .",

                "according to the bbc news this morning , philip hammond , the chancellor , will stand up at 12.30pm to deliver a budget intended to revive the government 's fortunes '' .", 
                "good luck with that .", 
                "a more jaundiced view might be that his primary goal is to avoid catastrophe .", 
                "the first budget after a general election is normally the one chancellors use to raise taxes .", 
                "but given that the conservative party on its own does n't have a parliamentary majority , and that the voters ' tolerance of austerity seems to have reached its limit , hammond has very little room for manoeuvre .", 
                "my colleague larry elliott , in his pre-budget analysis , reckons it will be the trickiest budget for a generation '' .", 
                "it would be a challenge for even the most creative , dexterous , authoritative chancellor .", 
                "but hammond is not that man .", 
                "he was chosen by theresa may as a steady , city-friendly , fiscally conservative safe-pair-of-hands unlikely to overshadow her , but since then their relationship has deteriorated swiftly and he only avoided the sack after the general election because the result left her too weak to move him .", 
                "but his long-term future at number 11 is uncertain and there has been speculation that he could be moved in a reshuffle .", 
                "only last week nick timothy , may 's co chief of staff until june and for many years someone whose views were thought to be interchangeable with hers , wrote a column in the sun deriding him as useless ( i paraphrase , but only a bit ) .", 
                "the tory right would like to see him go because he 's accused of brexit thoughtcrime ( he thinks it 's a lousy idea , and finds it hard to pretend otherwise ) .", 
                "and his last budget backfired when he had to abandon one its main money-raising measures within a week .", 
                "for the chancellor , a budget that does n't lead to a u-turn and sees him still in his job at christmas would amount to a result of sorts .", 
                "anything else would be a welcome bonus .", 
                "here is the guardian 's overnight budget preview story .", 
                "budget seen as 'make or break ' for philip hammond read more and here is our guide to what to look out for .", 
                "what to look out for in philip hammond 's budget speech read more i 'll be covering the build-up to the budget , the announcement itself , and the reaction with my colleague graeme wearden .", 
                "after hammond sits down we will be focusing particularly on the small print '' in the budget , the surprise and hidden announcements buried in the red book .", 
                "we will also be flagging up the best analysis .", 
                "the key timings are : 12pm : pmqs ( we will cover the may/corbyn exchanges , and budget-related comments ) 12.30pm : hammond 's budget statement .", 
                "3pm : office for budget responsibility press conference .", 
                "if you want to follow us , or contact us , on twitter i 'm on @ twitterid and graeme is on @ twitterid ."
