                "accompanying the speech was a chunky 100 page boe report discussing the impact of eu membership on the central bank 's policy objectives .", 
                "despite carney earlier this week having described the report as a bit of a yawner '' it will not prevent some from asking whether the boe should be taking a more neutral stance on such a highly charged political issue ( especially after similar interventions by carney on scottish independence and climate change ) .", 
                "carney emphasised the report is not a thorough quantitative review of the pros and cons of eu membership , but rather is designed to assess the impact of membership on the bank 's policy objectives .", 
                "in doing so , however , carney highlights the beneficial impact eu membership has likely had in lifting sustainable growth in the uk ( through fostering greater competition , efficiency and openness in key markets ) .", 
                "the flip side of this openness to europe is the higher sensitivity to external shocks , although carney believes policy makers in the uk have adequate capacity to deal with these challenges .", 
                "a key concern for carney looking forward is that uk policymakers retain adequate flexibility and control over policy , even as euro area countries go through a process of greater integration and risk sharing in the wake of the financial crisis .", 
                "carney 's comments have clear parallels with the government 's position in the debate .", 
                "the assertion that eu membership is a net positive for the uk , with caveats that the terms of membership need to reflect uk domestic interests and flexibility , will go down well with the prime minister - who seeks to renegotiate the terms of membership ahead of the referendum vote , and remove a requirement for the uk to commit to 'ever closer union ' . ''",

                "the opinion polls suggest that the result of the referendum will be very close .", 
                "our view has been that opinion will shift as the campaign heats up , with polls indicating a comfortable lead for the campaign to remain within the eu .", 
                "while a natural status quo bias is central to this view , it also reflects our belief that the in '' campaign will gain the backing of at least a majority in the business community .", 
                "this week the cbi - which represents a broad cross section of small and large businesses - moved off the fence by coming out in support for the uk staying within the eu .", 
                "the rhetoric behind carney 's remarks put the boe in the same camp , even if the governor stops short of offering an explicit endorsement .",
