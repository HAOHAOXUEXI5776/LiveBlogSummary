                "according to bloomberg , a levy could be imposed on foreign exchange transactions .", 
                "it would be pitched as a way of curbing reckless currency speculation .", 
                "however , it could also effectively act as a capital control , as it would make it more expensive to shift yuan deposits into other currencies .", 
                "bloomberg explains that the new tax would be imposed carefully : the initial rate of the so-called tobin tax may be kept at zero to allow authorities time to refine the rules , said the people , who asked not to be identified as the discussions are private .", 
                "the tax is not designed to disrupt hedging and other foreign-exchange transactions undertaken by companies , they said .", 
                "imposing a levy on foreign-exchange trading would be the most extreme step yet by policy makers to prevent speculative bets against the chinese currency , after state-run banks repeatedly intervened to support the yuan and the government intensified a crackdown on capital outflows .", 
                "a tobin tax would complicate plans by china to create an international reserve currency and could undermine the leadership 's pledge to increase the role of market forces in the world 's second-largest economy .",
