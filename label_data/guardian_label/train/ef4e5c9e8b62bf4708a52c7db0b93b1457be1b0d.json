                "i 'm back from the number 10 lobby briefing .", 
                "for the first time today the cabinet had a proper discussion about what trade relationship with the eu britain wants after brexit .", 
                "and , not surprisingly , there were n't any last minute calls for brexit to be abandoned on the grounds that it was all a terrible idea .", 
                "according to the briefing , it all seems to have gone quite smoothly and the cabinet was broadly united about what it wanted - although journalists were not really left any wiser about where it will all end up .", 
                "here are the main points .", 
                "may and david davis , the brexit secretary , were both clear that the uk wants a bespoke deal .", 
                "may said that staying part of the european economic area ( the so-called norway model ) would be democratically unsustainable ( because the uk would have to obey eu laws ) and she also said she wanted a significantly more ambitious deal than the one the eu has with canada .", 
                "she also said the uk should be creative in designing a proposal for a future economic partnership .", 
                "according to the prime minister 's spokesman , may said the government would develop its goals on the basis of the plans set out in her lancaster house and florence speeches .", 
                "the spokesman dismissed objections to may 's demands for a bespoke deal from the eu .", 
                "he also implied the eu would end up backing down to an extent .", 
                "michel barnier , the eu 's chief brexit negotiator , has insisted that the uk will not get a bespoke trade deal ( in the sense of a deal that combines the access advantages of a norway deal , with the regulatory divergence advantages of a canada deal ) .", 
                "the eu has also dismissed the idea of deal that gives some sectors of the uk economy preferential access to the single market , even though this was an idea may floated in her lancaster house speech .", 
                "asked about these objections , the spokesman said : this is the beginning of the phase two negotiations .", 
                "you would expect the commission to be setting out their position .", 
                "i would imagine you will hear a lot more from them before you hear less .", 
                "immigration was not discussed at the cabinet meeting .", 
                "this is interesting because immigration was one of the main issues during the eu referendum , with leave campaigners saying the uk had to leave the eu because otherwise it would not be able to curb eu immigration .", 
                "may claimed the uk could benefit from brexit .", 
                "asked if the prime minister explained how britain would benefit from leaving the eu , the spokesman said : the prime minister said it provides us with an opportunity .", 
                "we want to be able to strike those ambitious trade deals with other countries .", 
                "and she believes that there is an opportunity here , if grasped , to make us a more prosperous , more secure country .", 
                "a colleague pointed out that , in the one major speech she gave during the eu referendum campaign , may argued the opposite ; she said brexit would be bad for prosperity and security .", 
                "when this was put to him , the spokesman said he did not want to go over old ground .", 
                "further cabinet discussions about the desired brexit outcome are planned for next year .", 
                "may is reportedly planning a big brexit speech early in the new year to set out more details of what the uk wants .", 
                "the spokesman would not confirm this , but he did say that the government had always planned to be transparent about the process .", 
                "some 25 ministers took part in the discussion , during a meeting which lasted for an hour and 45 minutes .", 
                "the cabinet was agreed on its broad objectives , the spokesman said.asked if ministers were in agreement on the way ahead , the spokesman said ministers were agreed in terms of what we want to achieve .", 
                "he described it as a good , clear discussion .", 
                "the spokesman would not say if ministers were giving a presentation at or ahead of the meeting or if olly robbins , the prime minister 's chief brexit adviser , address cabinet .", 
                "robbins reportedly spoke at yesterday 's brexit cabinet sub committee meeting .", 
                "number 10 dismissed the claim by michel barnier , the eu 's chief brexit negotiator , that the uk will not get a special deal for financial services .", 
                "barnier 's comments were not discussed specifically at the cabinet meeting .", 
                "but the spokesman said : as we have said throughout , we are confident of negotiating a deep and special economic partnership that will include a good deal for financial services .", 
                "as we have always been clear , that will be in the eu 's best interests as well as ours .",
