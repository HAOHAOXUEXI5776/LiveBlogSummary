                "the euro 's fall proved short-lived and the yield of 10-year italian government bonds rose by just 10bp or so to around 2.0 % .", 
                "this is hardly surprising given that a no '' vote and subsequent resignation by prime minister matteo renzi had largely been discounted , and that the risk of an imminent italian exit from the euro-zone remains very small .",

                "in fact , if anything , it - and the yields of other bonds - have been kept artificially low by the ecb 's asset purchases in the past two years .", 
                "so there is plenty of scope for it to climb as political events unfold against a backdrop of renewed economic stagnation and ongoing concerns about the country 's banking sector admittedly , any substantial rise in the yield will probably depend on a snap election being called , which would give the anti-euro five star movement ( m5s ) an opportunity to seize power .", 
                "while we doubt there will be an early election , we can not rule out the possibility altogether granted , the euro-zone authorities are far better equipped to deal with upward pressure on yields today than they were back in 2011/12 .",

                "even if the best-case scenario '' for bonds came to pass - where a new prime minister were asked to head the existing government relatively quickly and an early election were avoided - we expect that it would only provide temporary respite for italy 's bond market given the country 's troubles ."
