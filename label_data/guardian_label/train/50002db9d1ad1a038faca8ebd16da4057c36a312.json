                "and in both the tests have been constructed as a means of exposing future government failings .", 
                "the labour tests ( see 10.53am ) are mostly very general and , surprisingly , theresa may would happily sign up to almost all of them .", 
                "the only exception is the second one , cunningly included because it will almost certainly enable labour to accuse the government of breaking a promise david davis himself made to mps in the commons .", 
                "( ian dunt has written a good blog explaining how davis came out with the incriminating quote because he appeared to get carried away in an exchange with anna soubry . )", 
                "but the wording of the labour tests is broad-brush , and it is likely that by 2019 labour will be able to argue that the government has failed on at least two others ( 5 and 6 ) , and possibly three others ( if 1 is included as well ) .", 
                "here is an assessment .", 
                "i will try the same exercise with the ukip one soon .",

                "does may want this ?", 
                ": ideally , yes , and david davis is on record as saying that he would like to achieve this , but downing street is distancing itself from davis 's comment ( see 12.40pm ) because it knows that the chances of retaining the exact same benefits '' of sm and cu membership are tiny .",

                ": yes , because she has made it a priority .", 
                "it is possible that labour could decide that may 's outcome fails its test because her migration policy is so draconian that it is not fair '' although , with ministers stressing the need to ensure employers can still hire from the eu , the outcome is likely to pass labour 's test .",

                ": after brexit the uk will have full control of employment rights and so may can protect them if she wants .",

                "5 - does it protect national security and our capacity to tackle cross-border crime ?", 
                "does may want this ?",

                "will may get this ?", 
                ": that depends on how you define defending the capacity to tackle cross-border crime .", 
                "the government wants as far as possible to retain cooperation on tackling crime , but disentangling the uk from the eu 's multiple justice and home affairs agencies and agreements without having some negative effect may be hard .",

                "does may want this ?",

            "text": [
                "in a debate in the commons in december sir keir starmer , the shadow brexit secretary , set out five conditions that labour would demand from the government 's brexit plan .", 
                "at that point downing street had only just agreed to publish a plan '' and the white paper was still about six weeks away .", 
                "starmer said that if the government did not accept the five conditions , labour would seek to impose them on the government by amending the article 50 bill as it went through parliament .", 
                "by my count , the government 's white paper only met two of starmer 's five conditions , and that assumes a rather generous interpretation of 'enough detail to end uncertainty ' and 'enough detail to allow parliamentary scrutiny ' ( conditions one and two ) .", 
                "the other three ( 'enough detail to allow the obr to make forecasts ' , 'meeting the concerns of devolved bodies ' and 'able to secure consensus support ) were not met .", 
                "labour did try to amend the bill as it went through the commons , but it backed the bill anyway at third reading after its amendments failed , leading to claims that it had not tried very hard to get its way .", 
                "so what is the value of starmer 's latest shopping list of conditions ?", 
                "on past form , there is little chance of them all being met .", 
                "but that is probably not the point .", 
                "what the speech does do is a ) give labour a position behind which it can unite , b ) set up a position from which labour will be able to criticise the government during the brexit talks ( but without being open to the charge of being fully anti-brexit ) and c ) provide a pretext for labour being able to vote against the final brexit deal .", 
                "here are the key points .", 
                "starmer said labour require the brexit deal to provide the exact same benefits '' as membership of the single market and customs union currently does .", 
                "this was the most important of his six conditions .", 
                "here they are in full .", 
                "1 .", 
                "does it ensure a strong and collaborative future relationship with the eu ?", 
                "2 .", 
                "does it deliver the exact same benefits '' as we currently have as members of the single market and customs union ?", 
                "3 .", 
                "does it ensure the fair management of migration in the interests of the economy and communities ?", 
                "4 .", 
                "does it defend rights and protections and prevent a race to the bottom ?", 
                "5 .", 
                "does it protect national security and our capacity to tackle cross-border crime ?", 
                "6 .", 
                "does it deliver for all regions and nations of the uk ?", 
                "explaining why he was using the phrase exact same benefits '' , starmer said : this is of course , the clear commitment that david davis has given in the house of commons ; to deliver : a comprehensive free trade agreement and a comprehensive customs agreement that will deliver the exact same benefits as we [ currently ] have '' .", 
                "the exact same benefits '' is an exacting standard .", 
                "but it is one the government has made .", 
                "and it is one i will hold them to .", 
                "failure to deliver this deal will lie squarely at the government 's door .", 
                "a trade deal that provided the exact same benefits '' as single market membership , while keeping britain out of the free movement regime ( starmer 's condition 3 ) is very similar to the boris johnson 'having your cake and eat it ' negotiating aim .", 
                "it is probably unlikely to be achieved .", 
                "he said that , if the final brexit deal did not pass these six tests , labour would not support it in the commons .", 
                "he claimed that if labour had voted against article 50 in parliament , it would have let the government off the hook '' .", 
                "he said : while labour did not support leaving the european union we have accepted that choice was made and that it will now be delivered .", 
                "that is why we voted in parliament for article 50 to be triggered .", 
                "i believe to have done otherwise would have diverted the debate and let the government off the hook by allowing it to continually focus on the outcome of the vote rather than the proper interpretation of the mandate .", 
                "for an alternative view , read this new european article by the former labour home secretary charles clarke .", 
                "clarke thinks labour should have voted against the article 50 bill at third reading after its amendments failed .", 
                "starmer said that he thought the brexit vote was a vote not just against the eu , but a vote for fundamental change .", 
                "the referendum vote on june 23 was , in my view , a vote on the state of the nation .", 
                "and it was years in the making .", 
                "yes , there were concerns about the functioning of the eu , its remoteness and the slow pace of reform .", 
                "but there was also a desire felt by people in many parts of the country that politics and the economy no longer worked for them or their communities .", 
                "the brexiteers offered false hope that by voting to leave the eu all that would change .", 
                "but the truth is that brexit can not tackle stagnant wages , resolve a chronic skills gap , reduce unequal growth across the uk or improve underfunded public services .", 
                "brexit can not mend public trust in politics or build more cohesive communities .", 
                "and it can not provide a place for britain in a more complex and chaotic global order .", 
                "this is interesting because it is similar to theresa may 's analysis of the brexit vote ( but not philip hammond 's - as he makes clear towards the end of this economist interview . )", 
                "but starmer is much more sceptical than may about the ability of brexit to deliver the fundamental change people want .",
