                "nick boles , the skills minister , has launched an attack on the bbc 's newsnight for conducting a witch-hunt '' against the tory chairman lord feldman , after it reported that he was given a dossier five years ago containing allegations of bullying in the party 's youth wing .", 
                "chris grayling , the leader of the commons , has accused leftwingers of scaremongering '' about ttip ( the transatlantic trade and investment partnership , the proposed eu/us trade deal ) .", 
                "speaking during business questions he said : there has been a huge amount of inappropriate scaremongering about ttip ; it is being used by left-wing pressure groups as a vehicle to make an anti-government campaign more widespread .", 
                "it is about time those groups acted more responsibly and stopped telling people things that are simply not true .", 
                "later , during a backbench debate on ttip , the labour mp geraint davies called for the investor-state dispute settlement ( isds ) provisions to be removed from the bill .", 
                "these allow corporations to sue governments in some circumstances if they are adversely affected by policy decisions .", 
                "davies said : my point about ttip is n't to burn it , shoot it , get rid of it , it is actually to pull the teeth , the isds teeth , out of the wolf and actually genetically edit it so that we actually have environmental imperatives in it , we have enforceable rights at work , we have human rights , so it is a blueprint for future global trade rather than a blueprint for environmental and human rights and other destruction .", 
                "guto bebb , the conservative party who heads the all-party parliamentary group on ttip , told the same debate that concerns about the treaty were being fuelled by a latent anti-western , anti-us agenda which i find frankly disreputable '' .", 
                "resistance to david cameron 's proposed four-year freeze on in-work benefits for non-british eu citizens is now total across the other 27 countries .", 
                "as ian traynor reports , a view has crystallised in brussels that the british prime minister will need to climb down on the welfare issue if he wants a deal by february .", 
                "while cameron is in a hurry to finalise an agreement to be put to a referendum , other key governments including germany do not want to be rushed .", 
                "cameron , according to a senior source in brussels , has to adapt his position to reality '' on the welfare row .", 
                "all the legal experts say this is not feasible , '' the source said .", 
                "everyone we consult tells us the same thing .",
