                "the government faces a potential commons defeat today over its decision to end the arrival of unaccompanied refugee children under the dubs scheme , with up to 30 conservative mps possibly voting to kickstart the process again .", 
                "conservative heidi allen , backed by almost two dozen other mps , among them nine other tories , including former education secretary nicky morgan and former business minister anna soubry has tabled an amendment saying local authorities should be audited in order to show their capacity for resettling children .", 
                "immigration minister robert goodwill said councils had told the government they had capacity for just 350 children , which has been disputed by many local authorities .", 
                "the prime minister 's spokesman told reporters this morning at lobby briefing that the government was not in favour of the audit .", 
                "we have a record of which we are justifiably proud in relation to refugees , giving sanctuary to 8000 last year , and children are continuing to arrive every year .", 
                "this is not an amendment the government supports .", 
                "we do n't think this is the right approach , there 's the additional burden on local authorities and we are already committed to publishing regional breakdowns showing where unaccompanied asylum seeking children are being looked after and we think it is right we focus on protecting the children who are already in the uk and spreading that burden across the country evenly .", 
                "but the key point is that we are also making sure we do n't provide the incentive , as the prime minister said , for children to make perilous journeys in the hands of people traffickers to get to mainland europe .", 
                "asked by reporters whether theresa may had been persuaded by any of the arguments made by william hague in favour of an early general election ( see 9.52am ) , he said : i ca n't shake my head more vigorously ."
