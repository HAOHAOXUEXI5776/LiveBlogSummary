                "the christian democrats ' score , sharply down on the 41 % of the vote it collected in the previous 2013 elections , was widely seen as disappointing and is likely to leave merkel diminished on the domestic political stage .",

                "the far-right , anti-immigration afd made a historic breakthrough , winning 13.5 % of the vote and a projected 87 seats and becoming the first overtly nationalist party to sit in the bundestag in 60 years .", 
                "the party 's performance marks a major shift in germany 's postwar politics that is likely to produce a very different tone and dynamic inside the bundestag .", 
                "the spd 's decision to become the official parliamentary opposition leaves the only feasible coalition for merkel a three-party tie up between the cdu/csu , the pro-business fdp party who scored 10 % , and the greens , who won 9 % : the so-called black-yellow-green jamaica coalition , which has worked at state level but never been tried in federal government .", 
                "this could prove tricky to negotiate .", 
                "merkel said in her post-election speech that the cdu had hoped for a better result but had faced referring to the 2015 migrant crisis an extraordinary challenge and had still managed to remain germany 's largest party .",

                "the afd promised constructive opposition in parliament but the greens have already complained that nazis have returned to parliament .",

                "polls indicate there is little doubt that merkel 's centre-right cdu and its csu sister party are heading for a comfortable victory over their social democrat spd rivals , and that mutti mummy will remain chancellor .", 
                "but in a major step-change in german politics , a late polling surge by the far-right , anti-immigrant afd party is set to see it enter the bundestag for the first time , possibly finishing as the third largest party and forming the official opposition in the new parliament .", 
                "the performance of the pro-business fdp party , likely to return to parliament this time round after failing to clear the 5 % threshold in the previous 2013 election and a potential coalition partner for merkel , will also be closely watched .", 
                "exit polls are expected when polls close at 6pm local time with first projected vote shares soon after .", 
                "we will be bringing you all the latest results and developments throughout the evening , plus comment , analysis and colour from the guardian 's berlin bureau chief philip oltermann and correspondent kate connolly ."
