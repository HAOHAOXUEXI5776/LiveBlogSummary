                "but the benefits accrue mainly to migrants themselves ( and business owners ) there is no great argument of liberal principle for free eu movement ; the economics is debatable ; and the politics is conclusively hostile i do not see much upside in brexit , but one is the opportunity for a more rational immigration policy .", 
                "but cable says there is one argument for free movement : that accepting it could keep the uk in the single market .", 
                "the argument for free movement has become tactical : it is part of a package that also contains the wider economic benefits of the single market .", 
                "those benefits are real , which is why the government must prioritise single market access and shared regulation .", 
                "yet that may not be possible to reconcile with restrictions on movement .",

                "it is the middlingly wealthy who end up paying it because it is pretty easy , if you can give money away during your life , or use trusts and so on , for people who have got serious money not to pay the full 40 % i think there is a case for looking at inheritance tax .", 
                "there are some really absurdly obvious loopholes in it that one might want to sort out .",

                "if you want to do more to ensure that people have a more equal start in life , or more equal inheritance , then you need more inheritance tax .", 
                "but you may well then find that a more effective set of policies are policies that support younger people , particularly in the housing market .", 
                "policies for example that you increase council tax and reduce stamp duty , or increase the amount of houses that are built , so that the importance of this inheritance becomes less significant the more constructive thing in the long run is , part of the real big problem here is that the younger generation is doing very badly in terms of pensions , very badly in terms of housing , not very well in terms of earnings .", 
                "if you can sort those things out , then inheritance becomes less important proportionately .",

                "at present , agricultural land and unquoted business assets are exempt from inheritance tax , at a cost to the exchequer of \u00a3 440m and \u00a3 590m per year respectively .", 
                "while there might conceivably be a case for allowing tax payments to be spread over time where assets received are illiquid and are to be retained by the recipient , it is hard to see any justification for the wholesale exemption of these assets .", 
                "these reliefs create just the sort of non-neutrality the tax system ought to try to avoid , pushing up the price of agricultural land and of certain offerings on the aim market , and providing a large incentive to keep businesses going and in the family even if there are good financial reasons for disposing of them sooner - as well as providing an open invitation for people to buy what might otherwise be wholly inappropriate assets purely as a way to avoid inheritance tax ( albeit with a minimum holding period of the assets to qualify for relief ) .", 
                "the principal reason that inheritance tax is forecast to raise only \u00a3 4.2bn in 2015-16 is that it can be circumvented by the simple expedient of passing on wealth during one 's lifetime .", 
                "transfers in the seven years before death are taxed on a sliding scale ( from zero for transfers more than seven years before death to the full 40 % rate for transfers less than three years before death ) , but gifts made before that are not taxed at all .", 
                "those who are able - often the wealthiest - are encouraged to pass on their wealth at a time dictated by the tax system .", 
                "a simple option would be to lengthen the seven-year window before death during which lifetime transfers are taxable .", 
                "for example , in 2007 , the liberal democrats proposed that only transfers made more than 15 years before death should be exempt , though this was not ultimately adopted for their 2010 general election manifesto .",
