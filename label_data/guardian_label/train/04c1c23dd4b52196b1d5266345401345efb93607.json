                "the u.k. 's monetary authorities have drawn on the flexibility afforded by a reserve currency and this has benefited public debt sustainability , in our view .", 
                "we expect the u.k. economy to expand by more than 3.0 % this year and 2.7 % in 2015 , as domestic demand benefits from further job creation and private-sector wage growth gradually returns .",

                "nevertheless , low interest rates and de-risking in the financial services sector ( the output of which is indirectly measured via interest margins ) will preclude financial-sector productivity fully returning to pre-crisis levels over the 2014-2017 forecast horizon , in our view .", 
                "u.k. financial and insurance services make up roughly 9 % of 2013 gdp .",

                "the most important contributor to the deterioration in the u.k. 's current account balance-to 4.2 % of gdp ( 2013 outcome ) currently from 2.0 % pre-crisis ( 1998-2007 average ) -is the shift in the incomes component of the current account deficit .", 
                "it has gone from a pre-crisis surplus ( 1.2 % of gdp in 1998-2007 ) to a deficit of 0.8 % of gdp in 2013 .", 
                "recent revisions to the u.k. 's national accounts indicate that the 2008-2009 recession was less severe than previously thought .", 
                "as a consequence , annual average 2008-2012 gdp growth was revised 0.5 percentage points higher , reflecting primarily upward revisions to investment .", 
                "at end-september 2014 , national accounts revisions also led to an upward adjustment in nominal gdp by just over 6 % for 2013 .",
