                "as i noted in my address to the nation on september 10 , with a new iraqi government in place , and following consultations with allies abroad and the congress at home , i have ordered implementation of a new comprehensive and sustained counterterrorism strategy to degrade , and ultimately defeat , isil .", 
                "as part of this strategy , i have directed the deployment of 475 additional u.s. armed forces personnel to iraq , and i have determined that it is necessary and appropriate to use the u.s. armed forces to conduct coordination with iraqi forces and to provide training , communications support , intelligence support , and other support , to select elements of the iraqi security forces , including kurdish peshmerga forces .", 
                "i have also ordered the u.s. armed forces to conduct a systematic campaign of airstrikes and other necessary actions against these terrorists in iraq and syria .", 
                "these actions are being undertaken in coordination with and at the request of the government of iraq and in conjunction with coalition partners .", 
                "it is not possible to know the duration of these deployments and operations .", 
                "i will continue to direct such additional measures as necessary to protect and secure u.s. citizens and our interests against the threat posed by isil .", 
                "i have directed these actions , which are in the national security and foreign policy interests of the united states , pursuant to my constitutional and statutory authority as commander in chief ( including the authority to carry out public law 107-40 and public law 107-243 ) and as chief executive , as well as my constitutional and statutory authority to conduct the foreign relations of the united states .",
