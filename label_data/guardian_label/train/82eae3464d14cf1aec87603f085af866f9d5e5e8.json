                "here are the main points from the david davis/michel barnier press conference .", 
                "barnier , the eu 's chief brexit negotiator , said the eu will not let the brexit talks progress to stage two , where the future trade relationship gets discussed , at the brussels summit in december unless the uk offers more .", 
                "he was primarily talking about the eu 's desire for the uk to confirm that it will pay more as it leaves than the \u0082\u00ac20bn that theresa may has put on the table .", 
                "( see 12.23pm . )", 
                "davis , the brexit secretary , said the uk would not let northern ireland stay in the customs union or the single market .", 
                "he was responding to reports of a leaked eu position paper that suggests ireland is calling for northern ireland to stay in the customs union and the single market to avoid a hard border going up between the republic and northern ireland .", 
                "with the uk government determined to leave the customs union and the single market , the paper implies the solution could involve northern ireland having different customs rules from the rest of the uk .", 
                "but davis said that was unacceptable .", 
                "he said : we respect the european union desire to protect the legal order of the single market and customs union .", 
                "but that can not come at cost to the constitutional and economic integrity of the united kingdom .", 
                "as i have said before , we recognise the need for specific solutions for the unique circumstances of northern ireland .", 
                "but let me be clear .", 
                "this can not amount to creating a new border inside our united kingdom .", 
                "davis repeated the uk 's determination to honour the [ financial ] commitments we have made during the period of our membership .", 
                "this is the formula used by theresa may in her florence speech .", 
                "but he did not say anything new about what these commitments are .", 
                "dia chakravarty , the telegraph 's brexit editor , thinks the government has not prepared voters for how expensive this will be .", 
                "dia chakravarty ( @ diachakravarty ) david davis reiterated uk will honour financial obligation .", 
                "amount floating in brussels is \u00e2\u00a3 60bn , we 've offered around \u00e2\u00a3 20bn .", 
                "very little has been done to prepare brits for any amount .", 
                "will be a difficult conversation within the country when time comes .", 
                "barnier said the uk and the eu had to agree an objective interpretation of what may meant when she said the uk would honour its financial commitments .", 
                "he said : this is absolutely vital if we are to achieve sufficient progress in december .", 
                "it is just a matter of settling accounts as in any separation .", 
                "barnier said there had to be sincere and real progress in the brexit talks for them to be able to move on to phase two , the trade and transition phase , in december .", 
                "the eu has always set sufficient progress as the threshold .", 
                "barnier repeated that formula today but at least twice he used sincere and real as qualifiers to explain what sufficient meant .", 
                "he said : only sufficient progress - that is to say sincere and real progress - on the three main key issues of these negotiations will enable the triggering of the of second phase of our negotiation .", 
                "barnier said the eu was not asking for concessions , and not planning to offer any itself .", 
                "we are not asking the uk for concessions , nor are we planning to make any concessions ourselves , he said .", 
                "he said the negotiation was just a matter of clarifying what was owed .", 
                "( but he was ignoring the fact that any offer by the uk to pay more than it has already agreed would be seen as a concession , regardless of brexit semantics . )", 
                "barnier said there were still some issues holding up an agreement on citizens ' rights .", 
                "he said : there are still a number of points that need more work : family reunification ; the right to export social security benefits ; and the role of the european court of justice in guaranteeing consistent application of case law in the uk and in the eu .", 
                "davis called for more flexibility and imagination in the negotiations .", 
                "he said : the united kingdom will continue to engage and negotiate constructively as we have done since the start .", 
                "but we need to see flexibility , imagination and willingness to make progress on both sides if these negotiations are to succeed and we are able to realise our new deep and special partnership .",
