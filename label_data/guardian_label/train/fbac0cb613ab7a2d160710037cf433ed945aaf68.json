                "but kendall said that she did not support cutting tuition fees ( as labour proposed in its manifesto ) because her priority would be investing in early years education instead .",

                "but burnham said labour should run its own campaign .", 
                "he said that the referendum would be a defining moment in politics , and that if labour won the campaign , this could be a springboard for success in the general election , because the tories would be split .", 
                "cooper has said that labour should have firm rules about work and welfare and more compulsory jobs .", 
                "in comments released in advance ( see 3.49pm ) , she also said that she supported the benefits cap in principle , but that there are big problems with how the government is applying it .",
