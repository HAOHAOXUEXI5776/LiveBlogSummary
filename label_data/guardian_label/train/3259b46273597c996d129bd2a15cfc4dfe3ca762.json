                "the labour party launched a pre-emptive strike last week , announcing its own plan to curb benefits for migrants , including possibly cutting tax credits for migrants who are working .", 
                "and today nick clegg has also put his proposals on the table , in an article in the financial times .", 
                "the lib dems also want to limit benefits for migrants .", 
                "here 's an extract from the ft 's news story ( subscription ) , summarising clegg 's position .", 
                "mr clegg accepts that british voters need to be reassured the rules are fair '' for migrant workers .", 
                "he has already proposed that eu migrants should not be able to claim child benefit for children not living in the uk .", 
                "now the deputy prime minister wants to stop migrants from claiming the new universal credit until they have worked in britain for six months : the benefit would then only be payable for a maximum of six months .", 
                "mr clegg also wants to restrict the access of migrants to in-work benefits like tax credits , saying they should only be paid to people working the equivalent of a 35-hour week on the minimum wage : a threshold of \u00a3 227 instead of the current \u00a3 153 .", 
                "and here is some more detail from clegg 's article .", 
                "clegg says that if cameron proposes putting limits on the number of eu migrants who can come to the uk , he will be making a big mistake .", 
                "david cameron will soon give his much built-up immigration speech .", 
                "if the prime minister asserts that a tory government will introduce caps or overall quotas on the number of eu migrants coming here , we will find ourselves in the worst of all worlds .", 
                "ukip will say it is not enough .", 
                "europe will say it is not possible .", 
                "once again the british people will be plunged into a cycle of wild overpromising and inevitable disappointment , their scepticism confirmed .", 
                "and the risks to the openness of the british economy will be considerable .", 
                "clegg says that other eu countries are restricting migrants ' access to benefits and that a recent european court of justice ruling had made this easier .", 
                "he says that , as a first step towards stopping migrants getting child benefit for children abroad , it should be paid at the rate in the home country .", 
                "as a first step , we should pay the same rate as the country in which those children reside .", 
                "in the uk it is about \u00a3 80 a month , whereas in poland it is less than half that .", 
                "and there are other proposals we must now explore .", 
                "he says britain should consider re-entry bans .", 
                "there are examples from which we can learn .", 
                "germany is pursuing five year re-entry bans for migrants involved in identity or benefit fraud .", 
                "we must see if we can strengthen our laws as well .", 
                "if there is any reaction to this , i will cover it later .", 
                "here 's the agenda for the day .",
