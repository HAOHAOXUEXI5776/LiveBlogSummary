                "as widely expected , the fed voted to start reducing its portfolio starting in october , and kept interest rates at a range of 1 % to 1.25 % .", 
                "the move , announced after a two-day meeting by fed officials , will start the gradual reduction of the central bank 's $ 4.5tn portfolio of bonds and other securities , bought to keep interest rates close to zero in an attempt to kickstart the economy .",
