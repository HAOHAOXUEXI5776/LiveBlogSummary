                "a week ago the prospect of nigel farage , the outgoing ukip leader , as ambassador to washington could be dismissed as some comic daily express/daily telegraph fantasy , but if trump is joining in , then that takes things to a new level .",

                "it is hard to imagine he expected her to take his advice , but he has put her in the position where she has had to reject his proposal .", 
                "hardly the special relationship .", 
                "3 - he has given a huge boost in status to a leading figure in a uk opposition party - again , an unfriendly move to may .",
