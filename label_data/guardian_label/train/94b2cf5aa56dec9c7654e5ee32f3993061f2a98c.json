                "philip hammond , the chancellor , has told mps that it will be necessary to have a post-brexit transitional deal '' because it will not be possible to complete divorce negotiations within the timetable set out by article 50 .", 
                "( see 5.07pm . )", 
                "hammond has said that two sorts of transitional deal could be possible .", 
                "one would cover the period between brexit and a clear and firm end state '' , setting out the period of adjustment to reach that goal .", 
                "and another could be put in place if the uk and the eu got to the end of the two-year article 50 withdrawal process without agreeing on a final end state '' , to allow time for further negotiations .", 
                "david davis , the brexit secretary , has signalled that he might approve the first kind of transitional deal , but not the second .", 
                "michel barnier , the european commission 's brexit negotiator , has also indicated that he would be more in favour of a transitional deal if it was a bridge to a destination already agreed .", 
                "but hammond hinted that he might favour a transitional deal even if it were just a means of delaying to brexit talks .", 
                "he said : in principle certainty is always preferable to uncertainty .", 
                "but if it 's a certainty of something very unfavourable then that 's not quite so good .", 
                "hammond has said that thoughtful politicians '' agree with him about the need for a transition period .", 
                "some have interpreted this as a jibe against his brexiteer colleagues like liam fox , the international trade secretary , or david davis , but it is more likely that he was having a dig at hardline pro-brexit tory backbenchers and figures like ukip 's nigel farage .", 
                "( see 7.17pm . )", 
                "hammond has said that leaving the eu could require the uk to spend hundreds of millions of pounds erecting and operating new border controls .", 
                "and there could be a five-fold increase in the paperwork required at the border , he said .", 
                "there could be quite significant physical infrastructure changes that need to be made at ports of entry and exit not only in the uk , but in continental europe as well .", 
                "there might be a need to train large numbers of people in anticipation of more intensive procedures at borders it is true that in certain conceivable outcomes there would be a very substantial increase in the numbers of customs submissions and customs inspections .", 
                "we are talking about - in eu trade - perhaps five times as many submissions and inspections being required .", 
                "it could certainly add hundreds of millions of pounds to the cost of operating the customs services .", 
                "he said he would like the uk to continue to participate in a number of cross-european programmes following brexit .", 
                "programmes like science , technology , research and development , academic exchange programmes are hugely beneficial to this country and countries across europe .", 
                "we would very much hope we will be able to agree a format which allows us to continue to participate in those programmes .", 
                "he said the government had not yet decided whether to aspire to remain in some form of customs union arrangement '' after brexit he said the government did not want to cut off the supply of high-skilled foreign workers after brexit .", 
                "just because you have a system of controlling immigration does not mean you have to use it to slam all doors shut .", 
                "i ca n't conceive of any circumstance in which we would want to impede or prevent the flow of highly-skilled , highly-paid people i do n't think it is highly-paid , highly-skilled people that cause concern among our own population about migration numbers .", 
                "he said brexit could encourage farmers to introduce more automation .", 
                "he said that in the horticultural and agricultural sectors there were steps of automation that can be taken '' by investment in machines that are not taken when access to low-cost labour is available '' .", 
                "he accepted that the most of the extra money going to councils for social care will be be available until nearer 2020 , but he suggested they should use their reserves to fund care in the meantime .", 
                "he also said money was not the only issue , echoing the line used by number 10 earlier .", 
                "( see 12.56pm . )", 
                "we recognise that the substantial increase in funding that social care will receive over this parliament is back-end loaded and we recognised that local authorities are challenged to deal with that pattern , that profile .", 
                "it is the case that local authorities in aggregate have been adding significantly to reserves .", 
                "i think \u00a3 9bn since the beginning of the last parliament .", 
                "and local authorities will have to look at how they manage the situation to get from here to the very substantial increase in funding that will be available to them later in the parliament .", 
                "but it 's also clear , and it 's clear from looking at the uk at areas where social care is working well and areas where it is facing much bigger challenges , that money alone is not the issue .", 
                "it is about effective cooperation and collaboration between the nhs and social services .", 
                "and the key to this is getting the very best practice that we have seen in some areas rolled out much more widely across england to deliver the high-quality social services we want to see .", 
                "absolutely , we think that coordination between the nhs and local authority social services is absolutely crucial and we think that in areas of the country where best practice is in evidence it is having a real and visible impact .",

                "he defended distributional impact assessments published by the treasury at the time of the autumn statement showing that the poorest 30 % are losing more from government tax and benefit changes than others apart from the richest 10 % .", 
                "he said that was a direct consequence of the government implementing the manifesto commitment it made to cut welfare spending .",

                "responding to questions about the times ' splash ( see 9.08am ) , the prime minister 's spokeswoman refused to comment on the claim that the government will raise the social care precept to allow councils to raise more money to fund care .", 
                "she said an announcement about local government funding would be made shortly .", 
                "but she also insisted that money was not the only issue , and that in some areas poor local authority management was contributing to social care problems .", 
                "she told journalists : more broadly , we know what money alone is not the solution it is not all about money .", 
                "there are other issues to be addressed alongside that we do think there 's a significant variety in how councils manage social care services we think it 's to do with management .", 
                "the spokeswoman said that the worst 10 % of councils had a transfer of care '' rate ( ie , the time taken to discharge a patient needing care from hospital ) that was 20 times worse than the best 10 % of councils .", 
                "and she said that just 20 local authorities account for half of all delayed discharges in england .", 
                "( delayed discharges occur when care is not available for patients who are ready to leave hospital . )", 
                "the spokeswoman also said that there were now 1m more people over the age of 65 than there were in 2010 , and that this was putting pressure on the social care system .", 
                "but the government had a strong track record '' of giving the health and social care system the money it needed , she said .", 
                "she said that the social care precept would raise an extra \u00a3 2bn a year by the end of this parliament , and that the government was also spending money on this through the better care fund and disabled facilities grants .",

                "the eu summit in brussels will start in the morning , instead of in the afternoon as usual , and after it is over the leaders of the other 27 eu states will have a dinner without may .",

                "we have been taking the time to prepare for the negotiations because we want a smooth and orderly departure .",

                "that 's why a new code for sports governance has been agreed that comes into effect next april .", 
                "it 's for the fa to decide how they respond to that .", 
                "they themselves have been clear that there are improvements to make to governance and they are committed to doing that .",
