                "theresa may 's speech is yet to come .", 
                "but we have had three days of tory conferencing already , as well as some indication as to what may will say , and so it is reasonable to draw some conclusions .", 
                "here are 10 things we 've learnt .", 
                "1 - for a party of government , the conservatives are perilously short of ideas .", 
                "may did have an agenda at the election but the loss of her majority meant that much of that has been ditched ( labour released a briefing document this week saying more than 40 % of tory manifesto promises - 181 out of 447 - have been dropped or shelved ) and there is very little evidence so far of an alternative domestic agenda .", 
                "may 's housing announcement ( see 8.40am ) may or may not turn out to be transformative , but otherwise what has been striking has been the paucity of policy thinking on bread-and-butter issues like schools and health , on crisis areas like social care , or on the problems of the future , like automation .", 
                "may 's difficulties are compounded by the fact that the government is still running a deficit and can only be confident of getting radical legislation through the commons with opposition support .", 
                "2 - the conservatives are desperate to win back young voters - but may be missing the big problem .", 
                "age , not class , has become the key divide in british politics and the few significant announcements we have had , on tuition fees , help to buy and council houses , have been aimed at the under-40s .", 
                "pensioners , by contrast , have not had a mention .", 
                "but on their own they might not be enough .", 
                "these are retail offers , but there is some evidence that the problem is cultural , and that young voters are turning away from the tories because 3 - the conservative party has become the brexit party .", 
                "at the time of the referendum it was a coalition , with members predominantly but not overwhelmingly pro-brexit and the leadership predominantly but not overwhelmingly against .", 
                "now it looks like an enthusiastic pro-brexit party .", 
                "in the hall only brexit really seems to get them going and the most popular fringe meetings have been those addressed by hardcore brexiteers .", 
                "mps say that pro-remain members have stayed away , and that some are leaving the party altogether .", 
                "4 - the prospect of jacob rees-mogg becoming next party leader is not quite as fanciful as it seemed in the summer .", 
                "rees-mogg has been the undoubted star of the fringe , and the queues to get into meetings he is addressing have been longer than anyone can remember at a tory conference .", 
                "the parallels are not exact , and the conservative leadership rules are different , but moggmania is reminiscent of the buzz generated by jeremy corbyn in the early summer of 2015 .", 
                "5 - but the prospect of boris johnson becoming leader has diminished .", 
                "his freelance brexit policy-making has boosted his standing with party members , but conservative party rules mean leadership candidates have to get through an mps ' filter before members vote on the final two , and johnson 's antics have gone down very , very badly with his colleagues .", 
                "because he has been perceived as disloyal , even some brexiteers have been criticising him .", 
                "in a good blog channel 4 news 's gary gibbon suggests johnson 's core support in the commons is now down to about 30 mps .", 
                "6 - as a campaigning organisation the conservative party has significant problems .", 
                "the party has had to deny claims membership is down to 100,000 , which would put in on a par with the lib dems ' .", 
                "( damian green said membership was around 120 , ,000 '' , although some members have their doubts . )", 
                "in the past having few members did not stop the party winning elections , but in june the tories were overwhelmed by labour on social media and on the ground and now , as people have been discussing at fringe meetings , the fabled election-winning machine looks knackered .", 
                "to make matters worse , no one seems to be investing much time working out what to do about it - perhaps because the party leader is consumed by brexit and does not expect to be around to worry about the next election .", 
                "7 - the conservatives have not yet found convincing arguments to undermine labour .", 
                "until the election they concentrated on de jeremy corbyn as a terrorist sympathiser .", 
                "that did n't work , and at this conference they have switched to the economy , giving us endless references to the 1970s and venezuela .", 
                "it takes time to work out whether or not political messages are effective , but there is no evidence yet to suggest that this attack line is hitting home .", 
                "8 - tory relations with business are strained .", 
                "a party conference speech from a conservative chancellor almost always gets a warm reception from business groups , but this year they were much more critical than usual .", 
                "big business did not want brexit , and this to a large extent explains the problem .", 
                "philip hammond 's call for businesses not to collaborate '' with labour also seems to have backfired .", 
                "9 - the conservatives have abandoned the austerity narrative .", 
                "three years ago ed miliband was ridiculed by the tories after failing to mention the deficit in his party conference speech .", 
                "the deficit it still with us , but the tories can see that people are fed up of anti-austerity and it has hardly had a mention all conference .", 
                "instead may is now talking about taking a balanced approach '' to the economy - whatever that means .", 
                "10 - there is no obvious successor to may .", 
                "there were expectations that the party conference would turn into a leadership beauty parade , but cabinet ministers have not been using their speeches to set themselves up as alternatives to may ( except johnson , a bit ) and none of the mainstream tories from the younger generation touted as possible future leaders have made much of a mark either ."

                "beth rigby ( @ bethrigby ) johnson just did tour of exhibition hall - press waiting on his way out ; i was pulled away by his security detail as i asked him about libya norman smith ( @ bbcnormans ) gave boris johnson opportunity to respond to serte `` dead bodies '' row and he declined to be interviewed # cpc17 beth rigby ( @ bethrigby ) me too ; though he did tell me off camera the furore was `` ridiculous '' and a result of people trying to `` distort '' what he says there is only one item on the agenda today .",
