                "the final day the commons sits before a christmas or summer recess is always a busy day for political journalists , because of the large number of government announcements that come out , but even allowing for that today has been remarkable .", 
                "there have been 36 written statements ( formal government news announcements ) from ministers .", 
                "there have been two much more important announcements , about local government spending and lords reform , that were accompanied by oral statements to the commons .", 
                "an important government quango , the social mobility and child poverty commission , has published its annual report .", 
                "and plenty more reports and documents have been issued too .", 
                "according to the gov.uk website , government departments have put out 424 publications today - and the number still seems to be going up .", 
                "at westminster it 's known as burying bad news '' or , after the same practice featured in an episode of west wing , taking out the trash '' day .", 
                "government spin doctors know that if they release a vast amount of potentially embarrassing news on the same day , they will limit the negative publicity .", 
                "in an ideal world the number 10 communications chief would also arrange for someone like jose mourinho to get sacked , but there are limits to the powers of craig oliver and so it 's best to put that one down to luck .", 
                "some of the information released today came under the heading of transparency '' and matthew hancock , the cabinet office minister , said in a statement that enhancing transparency and accountability continues to be at the heart of our approach to government '' .", 
                "that is hard to square with an approach to news management that seems intended to minimise scrutiny .", 
                "the prime minister 's spokesman said the government was having to put out so much news today because it had a big agenda '' , an equally tenuous claim .", 
                "announcements are made on the day before recess because many ministerial declarations have to be made to parliament .", 
                "some of the items released today are genuinely awkward or embarrassing for ministers .", 
                "but others are more innocuous , and they may have been held back not as part of a quasi cover-up , but simply as a result of inertia and whitehall 's innate reluctance to publish almost anything .", 
                "we have not read all 424 documents out today .", 
                "but here are 30 of the announcements that have come out that the government seem to want you to overlook .",
