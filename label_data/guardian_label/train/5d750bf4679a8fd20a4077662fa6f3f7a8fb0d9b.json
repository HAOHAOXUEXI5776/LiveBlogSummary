                "that was n't the most dramatic or exciting press conference in the european central bank 's 18 year history .", 
                "instead , there was a real end-of-term feeling , as mario draghi basically told reporters to come back in september and see if the ecb has decided to boost its stimulus programme .", 
                "given some of the dramas we 've seen in recent years , a dull ecb meeting should be welcomed ( as long as it does n't become a habit , mario ) .", 
                "so what did we learn ?", 
                "1 ) the ecb is n't panicking about brexit yet , although it believes it is a risk to the recovery .", 
                "draghi struck a pretty reassuring tone , declaring that : following the uk referendum on eu membership , our assessment is that euro area financial markets have weathered the spike in uncertainty and volatility with encouraging resilience what is clear is that financial markets and the banking sector have reacted in a fairly resilient fashion to the event.we have n't observed any disruption either in financial markets or the banking sector . ''", 
                "2 ) assessing the full impact of brexit will take some time .", 
                "that 's why the ecb did n't launch any new stimulus measures today .", 
                "over the coming months when we have more information including new staff projections we 'll be in a better position to assess the underlying macroeconomic conditions .", 
                "3 ) draghi has given eurozone politicians a nudge to provide more financial support for the banking sector .", 
                "the most interesting part of the press conference , i think , was draghi 's comments about the non-performing loans which bedevil europe 's banks , notably in italy .", 
                "more than once he hinted that a public backstop is needed to help banks shift their non-performing loans .", 
                "draghi warned that these npls are threatening the recovery : the longer we have this ( non-performing loan problem ) in place , the less functioning will be the banking system , or at least will be the banks with high npls .", 
                "and so the less capable will be these banks to transmit our monetary policy impulses to the real economy .", 
                "also , a high level of npls makes banks especially vulnerable to the markets . ''", 
                "this chart shows that southern european countries need help the most : holger zschaepitz ( @ schuldensuehner ) # ecb 's draghi : npls an obstacle to transmission of our monetary policy .", 
                "4 ) we might get fireworks in september .", 
                "draghi insisted that the ecb has the readiness , willingness and ability '' to take fresh action , if needed , to stimulate the economy .", 
                "by september , the ecb will have fresh economic forecasts - and a better idea of britain 's brexit plans .", 
                "5 ) qe might be tweaked soon .", 
                "economists are pretty confident that the ecb needs to adjust the rules of its asset-purchase scheme , to allow it to buy more bonds from individual companies .", 
                "draghi was adamant that the ecb wo n't run out of things to buy , saying : in the past we 've given enough evidence of our ability to adapt our purchases to reach 80 billion euros a month until march 2017 or beyond . ''",
