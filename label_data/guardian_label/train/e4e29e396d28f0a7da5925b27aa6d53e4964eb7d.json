                "both of which were captured by the election result .", 
                "first , the erosion of the sentimental and electoral loyalty to our party in white working class communities .",

                "solutions he said that revival of the party under tony blair and new labour had its origins in analysis published by marxism today in the 1980s .", 
                "that glorious , euphoric walk down downing street on that hazy may morning eighteen years ago was the culmination of a journey which began on the pages of marxism today in the early 1980s .", 
                "because it was there , whilst wrestling with the widespread conversion of the manual working classes to thatcherism at both the 1979 and 1983 elections , that historians and theorists - such as the late great eric hobsbawm and stuart hall - began to shine an unflinchingly brutal light upon the real not imagined political attitudes of the british working class .",

                "farage said that ukip should prepare for an eu referendum next may .",

                "in the past the electoral commission has said that it is opposed to the idea of referendums being held on the same day as elections , because the different issues could get confused .",

                "i fought a wholly positive campaign .", 
                "but he did concede that his call for a ban immigrants with hiv , which was cited by woolfe as an example of where the party sounded too harsh , was not something he was likely to repeat in the eu referendum campaign , because it was not an eu issue .",
