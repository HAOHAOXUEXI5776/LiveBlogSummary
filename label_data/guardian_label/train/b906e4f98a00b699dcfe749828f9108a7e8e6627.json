                "while chancellors like george osborne and gordon brown revelled in the showmanship of budget day , with announcements conveying boldness and authority , hammond is more an adherent of cautious , undemonstrative , accountancy politics .", 
                "it can make him a bit dull , although there is quite a lot to be said for 'boring ' in public policy making .", 
                "and , even in the hammond catalogue , this is not set to be one of his biggies .", 
                "technically it is his first budget , but the autumn statement has become identical to a budget in fiscal heft and so in practice this is his second .", 
                "it is also his last spring budget because , under a reform he introduced , from this autumn the annual budget will take place towards the end of the year .", 
                "( so there will be two budgets this year . )", 
                "according to some whitehall briefing , he considers the one later in the year as his main one for 2017 .", 
                "this will be a mere warm-up .", 
                "still , it is impossible to shuffle billions of pounds of public money around without doing and saying something of great interest and today i will be covering the budget , and reaction to it , with my colleague graeme wearden .", 
                "here is our main budget preview story .",
