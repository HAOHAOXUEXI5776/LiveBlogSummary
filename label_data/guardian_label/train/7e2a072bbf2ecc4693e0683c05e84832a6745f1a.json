                "analyst gary greenwood said : although there is no change to guidance for a progressive ordinary dividend payment , this may colour management 's thinking towards special dividend payments for the current financial year as management may wish to retail additional capital .", 
                "current guidance is for the group to generate capital before dividends equivalent of around 160 basis points of risk weighted assets in the current financial year .", 
                "this is equivalent to around 5p per share and compares to our current full year dividend forecast of 4p , which includes a 2.55p ordinary payment and 1.45p special .", 
                "it is likely that the anticipated special dividend may therefore be missed or reduced in order to finance the deal , albeit we would expect further surplus capital to be generated in subsequent years .", 
                "overall , the anticipated financial performance and shareholder value creation that is expected to be generated by this transaction is impressive , in our view , and suggests a better use of capital than simply returning it to shareholders .", 
                "that said , lloyds will be broadly doubling up its exposure to credit cards at a particularly benign point in the bad debt cycle and ahead of a potential slow-down in the uk economy once the terms of the uk 's exit from the eu are reached .", 
                "while there is some latitude in the financial metrics to absorb potentially higher impairments , the risk can not be ignored .", 
                "in addition , we see limited scope for organic growth given the high post transaction market share and attention such growth may attract from the competition authorities ."

                "reflecting a in emerging asian demand and factory output , the central bank upgraded its language to signal its confidence that the economy is headed for a steady recovery .",

                "kuroda also said he saw no problem with the yen 's recent declines against the dollar , saying such falls would help push up inflation by boosting import prices and in so doing raise inflation expectations , a crucial element in the boj 's plan to beat economic stagnation .", 
                "current exchange-rate moves can be described more as dollar strengthening rather than yen weakening , kuroda said .",

                "japanese stocks like it though , and the nikkei is up 0.5 % already , as a weaker currency , a brighter economic outlook and a low interest rate environment boost the japanese corporate outlook ."

                "even so the yen still remains above the levels it was when the bank of japan first pushed rates into negative territory in january , and reinforcing the reality that the only way the yen is likely to weaken further is as a result of future us policy moves .", 
                "those us moves are likely to involve further interest rate rises , perhaps in short order given the bullish tone on jobs of federal reserve chair janet yellen in a speech to students in baltimore on monday .",
