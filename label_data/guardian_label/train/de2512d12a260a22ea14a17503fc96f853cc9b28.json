                "in the uk one of the many arguments about brexit is about whether we should seek to remain in the single market after we leave through membership of the european economic area ( eea ) or the european free trade association ( efta ) .", 
                "but what do efta members think ?",

                "that was because it would give efta more clout in trade negotiations , he said .", 
                "he told the programme : they [ the uk ] could definitely join efta , and i think it would strengthen efta at least to have a cooperation with britain .", 
                "it is quite clear that when britain starts to negotiate their own free trade deal , then everyone wants to make a free trade deal with britain .", 
                "you are the fifth largest economy in the world .", 
                "everyone wants to sell you goods and services .",

                "it could be quite revealing .", 
                "and we 've also got a statement from boris johnson , the foreign secretary , on north korea .", 
                "here is the agenda for the day .",

                "( johnson and davis are both definitely giving statements , but the order has not been confirmed yet .",
