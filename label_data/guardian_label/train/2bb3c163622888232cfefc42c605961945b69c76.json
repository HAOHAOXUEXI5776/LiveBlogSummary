                "good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy , the financial markets and business .", 
                "the us federal reserve is unlikely to raise interest rates at its april meeting , the latest minutes of the federal open market committee ( fomc ) suggest .", 
                "chaired by janet yellen , the committee was clearly divided .", 
                "some members judged improving data suggested the us economy was ready for another rate hike .", 
                "others were more wary , fearful of recent trends in the global economy where risks appear to be mounting .", 
                "overall , the tone was cautious : a number of participants judged that the headwinds restraining growth and holding down the neutral rate of interest were likely to subside only slowly .", 
                "in light of this expectation and their assessment of the risks to the economic outlook , several expressed the view that a cautious approach to raising rates would be prudent or noted their concern that raising the target range as soon as april would signal a sense of urgency they did not think appropriate .", 
                "in contrast , some other participants indicated that an increase in the target range at the committee 's next meeting might well be warranted if the incoming economic data remained consistent with their expectations for moderate growth in output , further strengthening of the labor market , and inflation rising to 2 % over the medium term .", 
                "us markets rose : dow jones : +0.6 % at 17,716.05 s & p 500 : +1 % at 2,066.66 markets this morning await the latest minutes from the european central bank ."
