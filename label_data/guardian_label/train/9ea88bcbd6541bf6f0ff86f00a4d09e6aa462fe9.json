                "but as the guardian 's south asia correspondent michael safi explains , the comparison does not quite stack up : india 's carbon allowance under the paris agreement is relatively generous in recognition of the more than 300m indians still without access to electricity .",

                "india 's national energy agency has predicted no new coal plants , other than those already in the pipeline , may be required until at least 2027 .", 
                "surveying the toll of fossil-fuelled economic development on its rivers , farmland and air , india has recognised that transitioning to a low-carbon economy is firmly in national interests , as well as those of the planet .",
