                "owen smith has accused jeremy corbyn of releasing a deselection list '' .", 
                "speaking in the sky debate , smith , who is challenging corbyn for the leadership , criticised corbyn 's team for releasing a list singling out 13 labour mps it claims have abused the leader and his allies .", 
                "smith said this suggested that corbyn was planning to get his opponents deselected if he won .", 
                "he told corbyn : you talk about trying to unite the party .", 
                "i find that quite hard to reconcile with something your campaign did just this evening , which was publish a list , a deselection list if you like , of the 13 mps , including the deputy leader of our party , tom watson , who your campaign think have transgressed against you in criticising you .", 
                "that is n't unifying .", 
                "that is deeply divisive , and frankly , it 's where you began the contest by talking about deselection in your opening speech .", 
                "if that 's what you are intending to do when if win this election , to deselect all our mps , then we will be in even greater trouble than we are in right now it does feel like setting momentum onto them to try and get them deselected .", 
                "corbyn said that was not what the list was about .", 
                "but smith said that was how it would be seen by mps .", 
                "corbyn also defended the list , saying : there was information put out there which is statements that colleagues made on the record and it 's all stuff that is out there on the public record .", 
                "his comment contrasted with briefing from his team earlier in the evening saying the list of names should not have been released .", 
                "smith has accused corbyn of not knowing how many seats labour needs to gain to form a government .", 
                "corbyn replied at least 90 '' , but smith said that the number was 106 and that corbyn should know this .", 
                "corbyn said the actual figure depended on boundary changes .", 
                "labour has 230 seats in the house of commons and the conservatives 329 , a working majority of 16 .", 
                "smith was quoting a figure from this fabian society research .", 
                "the fabian society ( @ thefabians ) fabian analysis shows we need to win 106 seats to gain a majority in 2020 @ twitterid harrop # fabtea - see the report smith accused corbyn of not being straight about what he said about triggering article 50 on the morning after the eu referendum .", 
                "asked why he had said it had to be triggered now , corbyn said that article 50 did have to be invoked .", 
                "he was not necessarily saying at that moment , he implied .", 
                "but smith told him : jeremy says he wants straight talking , honest politics .", 
                "jeremy , i watched that interview .", 
                "you did say 'let 's trigger article 50 now ' and i think the country saw you say it .", 
                "and it 's unfortunate you should now seek to row back on that .", 
                "that 's all from me for tonight .",
