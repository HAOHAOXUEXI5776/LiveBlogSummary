                "the most important task facing the new government is negotiating brexit and the person in charge of that is david davis , the new brexit secretary .", 
                "what is he going to do ?", 
                "ultimately , theresa may will make the final decisions , but we have a very good insight into davis 's thinking because he wrote a long article on exactly this topic for conservativehome on monday .", 
                "here are some of the points he made .", 
                "davis said he expected the eu to continue to allow the uk tariff-free access to the single market , even with the uk imposing new border controls .", 
                "this leaves the question of single market access .", 
                "the ideal outcome , ( and in my view the most likely , after a lot of wrangling ) , is continued tariff-free access .", 
                "once the european nations realise that we are not going to budge on control of our borders , they will want to talk , in their own interest .", 
                "there may be some complexities about rules of origin and narrowly based regulatory compliance for exports into the eu , but that is all manageable .", 
                "he said triggering article 50 , the move that starts the two-year eu withdrawal process , should be delayed until around the end of the year .", 
                "but what if it they are irrational , as so many remain-supporting commentators asserted they would be in the run-up to the referendum ?", 
                "this is one of the reasons for taking a little time before triggering article 50 .", 
                "the negotiating strategy has to be properly designed , and there is some serious consultation to be done first .", 
                "constitutional propriety requires us to consult with the scots , welsh , and northern irish governments first , and common sense implies that we should consult with stakeholders like the city , cbi , tuc , small business bodies , the nfu , universities and research foundations and the like .", 
                "none of them should have any sort of veto , but we should try to accommodate their concerns so long as it does not compromise the main aim .", 
                "this whole process should be completed to allow triggering of article 50 before or by the beginning of next year .", 
                "he said that , if the eu insists on denying the uk tariff-free access to the single market , the uk should use the income from tariffs on eu imports to support british industry .", 
                "and he suggested the government should publish a pre-negotiation white paper before invoking article 50 .", 
                "in this process , we should work out what we do in the improbable event of the eu taking a dog in the manger attitude to single market tariff-free access , and insist on wto rules and levies , including 10 per cent levies on car exports .", 
                "let us be clear : i do not believe for a moment that that will happen , but let us humour the pre-referendum treasury fantasy .", 
                "in that eventuality , people seem to forget that the british government will be in receipt of over \u00a3 2 billion of levies on eu cars alone .", 
                "there is nothing to stop us supporting our indigenous car industry to make it more competitive if we so chose .", 
                "wto rules would not allow us to explicitly offset the levies charged , but we could do a great deal to support the industry if we wanted to .", 
                "research support , investment tax breaks , lower vehicle taxes - there are a whole range of possibilities to protect the industry , and if need be , the consumer .", 
                "such a package would naturally be designed to favour british consumers and british industry .", 
                "which of course is another reason that the eu will not force this outcome , particularly if we publicise it heavily in a pre-negotiation white paper .", 
                "he said that he wanted talks on securing trade deals with the uk 's main partners to start immediately , in the hope of concluding them within two years .", 
                "so be under no doubt : we can do deals with our trading partners , and we can do them quickly .", 
                "i would expect the new prime minister on september 9th [ this was written before andrea leadsom pulled out of the tory leadership contest ] to immediately trigger a large round of global trade deals with all our most favoured trade partners .", 
                "i would expect that the negotiation phase of most of them to be concluded within between 12 and 24 months .", 
                "so within two years , before the negotiation with the eu is likely to be complete , and therefore before anything material has changed , we can negotiate a free trade area massively larger than the eu .", 
                "trade deals with the us and china alone will give us a trade area almost twice the size of the eu , and of course we will also be seeking deals with hong kong , canada , australia , india , japan , the uae , indonesia - and many others .",
