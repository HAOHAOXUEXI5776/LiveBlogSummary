                "it says : this budget takes the mid-point of the ifs 's estimates , \u00a3 30 billion , as the likely deterioration in the public finances and shows the types of trade-offs involved in dealing with such a deficit in 2019-20 .", 
                "one plausible scenario shows that : health spending would be cut by \u00a3 2.5 billion , defence spending by \u00a3 1.2 billion and education spending by a similar amount the basic rate of income tax would rise by 2 pence to 22p and the higher rate by 3 pence to 43p capital spending would be reduced by \u00a3 2.4 billion fuel and alcohol duties would increase by 5 % the balance between tax and spend would be up to the government at the time .",

                "more importantly , it also suggests that osborne may find it impossible to carry on as chancellor even in the event of remain winning because his standing with some tory mps has been so badly damaged .", 
                "one theory is that , if leave win , the demotion of osborne could be the price tory brexiteers demand for allowing david cameron to continue as prime minister .",
