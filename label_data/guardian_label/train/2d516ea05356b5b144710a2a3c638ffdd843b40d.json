                "speaking of news ( corp , not poll ) , as we go live this morning , the communications minister malcolm turnbull is on radio national breakfast being asked about rupert murdoch 's favourite to turnbull 's ambition to overhaul australia 's media ownership laws .", 
                "turnbull has recently popped this mildly explosive proposition on tony abbott 's desk for further action , or perhaps , inaction , depending on the prevailing winds .", 
                "( thanks , malcolm .", 
                "no thank you , tony . )", 
                "q : the ( cross media ownership laws ) are done , they are past their use by date .", 
                "they need to change now , do n't they ?", 
                "malcolm turnbull : i think they do .", 
                "q : are you going to push this ?", 
                "turnbull : my views are very clear , everyone knows i think they are out of date .", 
                "they were designed in a pre-internet era and they relate to a media landscape that does n't exist .", 
                "the two out of three rule , which for example says you can only control a two out of a newspaper , radio station or television station in the same market , was designed in an era when the only forms of media were newspapers , radio and tv .", 
                "well of course that 's completely transformed .", 
                "rupert murdoch 's views are also clear : if turnbull wants media ownership back on the agenda then he needs to look at the anti-siphoning list that reserves much premium sport for free tv .", 
                "murdoch would like more premium sport on pay tv , particularly given the competition about to hit australian shores with the arrival of streaming services like netflix .", 
                "turnbull : we are urged to do this ( do over the anti-siphoning list ) by the pay tv industry .", 
                "i absolutely respect and understand their commercial position but it 's important to understand that what they are seeking would not be popular , it would be most unpopular and in any event , it would need to be approved by the senate .", 
                "why does anyone imagine that this senate would be likely to approve changes that would be clearly as unpopular as that .", 
                "q : you know these changes need to occur .", 
                "turnbull : not to anti-siphoning .", 
                "sorry rupert .", 
                "hard times for honest moguls .", 
                "time to get loud and proud , the pl comments thread is now open for your business .", 
                "i 'm also available for banter , typo corrections , clarifications , or simple home renovations advice on the twits .",
