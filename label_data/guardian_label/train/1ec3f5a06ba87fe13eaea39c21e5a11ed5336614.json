                "since the 1960s , there have been an average of nearly 12 storms a year in the atlantic basin , with six turning into hurricanes .", 
                "only one or two a year , on average , make landfall in the us .", 
                "there has been a recent increase in short-lived tro storms and hurricanes , which may be linked to better monitoring or to the increase in ocean temperatures in the atlantic .", 
                "but at the same time the us has only just broken its longest hurricane drought in history .", 
                "before hurricane harvey barrelled into texas , the last category 3 storm to make landfall was hurricane wilma in 2005 .", 
                "hurricane ike , in 2008 , and hurricane sandy , in 2012 , caused a huge amount of damage but their winds were not as strong .",

                "the us will experience a severe swing away from its hurricane drought should hurricane irma slam into south florida .", 
                "never before have two category 4 or stronger hurricanes hit the us in the same season since records began in 1851 .", 
                "studies have shown that atlantic tro cyclones are getting stronger , on average , with researchers finding they are reaching category 3 ferocity more quickly over the past three decades .", 
                "at the moment , the atlantic is considered primed for strong hurricanes because of warm ocean temperatures , weak countervailing winds and high levels of air moisture .", 
                "the overall is nuanced .", 
                "we 're seeing fewer hurricanes but the ones we do see are more intense , said jim elsner , a geography academic at florida state who led research in 2015 that found rising warmer ocean temperatures are may be fueling stronger storms .",

                "one of the factors that drove hurricane harvey was unusually warm temperatures in the gulf of mexico .", 
                "as hurricanes churn up the oceans , colder water from the depths will normally slow them down .", 
                "but warming water the oceans globally are warming up as they absorb extra atmospheric heat generated by human activity will provide storms with an extra kick .", 
                "the warming atmosphere also contributes by adding more water available for rainfall .", 
                "for every 1f increase in temperature , the atmosphere can hold around 4 % more water vapour , which leads to heavier precipitation and worsens flooding .", 
                "meanwhile the oceans , on average globally , have risen by around half a foot over the past century due to the thermal expansion of warming water and run-off from rapidly melting glaciers .", 
                "sea level rise is particularly pronounced along the eastern us seaboard .", 
                "even a few millimeters of elevated sea level can cause more damaging flooding as hurricanes whip up storm surge that can inundate areas .", 
                "in 2012 , hurricane sandy was a sober reminder of this the storm was only a category 1 event but it caused the seas to wash into new york city and new jersey , resulting in tens of billions of dollars in damages .", 
                "what should we expect in the future ?", 
                "while some climate models show no change or even a small reduction in the frequency of hurricanes , scientists are becoming increasingly confident that the storms that remain will become more intense .", 
                "us government researchers project a 75 % increase in the frequency of category 4 and 5 hurricanes the two strongest levels over the coming century , with wind speed expected to increase between 2-11 % , on average .", 
                "the financial cost of hurricanes is likely to mount , calling into question development planning decisions along the coast and a national flood insurance scheme that is deeply in debt and frequently pays out for poorly situated properties that are repeatedly flooded .",
