                "later , on sky news , he partially backtracked , saying he thought cox 's death may have taken momentum away on both sides of the campaign , and that in the end it might make little difference '' to the outcome .",

                "my view is that those challenges will be easier to meet , those risks will be less , if we vote to leave because we will have control of the economic levers , we will have control over money we send to the european union , we will have control over our own laws , and as a result we will be able to deal with whatever the world throws at us .",
