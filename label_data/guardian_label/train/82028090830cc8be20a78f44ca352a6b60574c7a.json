                "commenter machenbach started a very interesting thread , which initially began in our hg wells reading group discussion : the reading group has been getting in a bit of a tangle attempting to reconcile wells 's \u0080\u0098progressive ' political ideas and support for human rights with some of his more ( to us ) unsavoury ( anti-semitic , eugenicist ) attitudes .", 
                "a common defence of this is that he was merely uncritically reflecting some of the common beliefs and biases of his time .", 
                "but , if that is the case , is the universalism implicit in the notion of \u0080\u0098human rights ' actually merely culturally and historically relative ?", 
                "if so , can we have it both ways asserting a universal humanity , which has rights , whilst also recognising the historically-particular grounding of this assertion ?",

                "i think one of the big reasons i like wells is that he knows his own contemporaneous culpability and relativity - and in his lifetime he matured enough to change his mind , he was n't afraid to , he lived and learned .", 
                "his friend joseph conrad took him to task about his early eugenicist rhetoric , which probably came from working with t huxley , `` darwin 's bulldog '' as his teacher as a young man .",
