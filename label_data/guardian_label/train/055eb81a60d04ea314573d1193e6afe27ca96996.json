                "here are the guardian 's main stories on today 's article 50 court ruling theresa may 's plan to trigger brexit by the end of march will not be derailed by a high court ruling that parliament must vote on the decision , no 10 has insisted .", 
                "official reaction on the continent to the high court 's ruling on article 50 has been muted , with national governments and the european commission regarding the decision as an internal matter .", 
                "parliament alone has the power to trigger brexit by notifying brussels of the uk 's intention to leave the european union , the high court has ruled .", 
                "the pound jumped on the news that negotiations over britain 's withdrawal from the european union could be delayed , after the high court rejected government claims that it has the sole power to trigger article 50 .", 
                "this is the most important development in the brexit story since the election of theresa may as prime minister and easily the most encouraging day for those who backed remain since the referendum on june 23 .", 
                "i 've posted vast amounts of commentary on this already , but here is what it means in six key points .", 
                "1 - the court ruling is much more definitive than anyone expected .", 
                "( see , for example , david allen green at 4.10pm . )", 
                "the government is appealing to the supreme court , but informed commentators seem to think it more likely than not that the government will lose again .", 
                "2 - unless the government does win at the supreme court , parliament will get to legislate on invoking article 50 .", 
                "and that means a proper bill , passing through the commons and the lords , with mps and peers getting the chance to amend it .", 
                "theresa may has been refusing to give parliament a vote on the terms of brexit because , once power shifts from the hands of the executive to the legislature ( see 8.49am ) , the prime minister loses some control .", 
                "the key point about today is that mps and peers have , for the first time , got a strong chance of shaping the start of the brexit process .", 
                "3 - the chances of brexit being overturned are still very minimal .", 
                "it is just about possible to conceive how the uk could stay in the eu ( parliament votes to insert a second referendum clause into the article 50 brexit bill , and some economic catastrophe results in a sharp change in public opinion by 2018 ) but you would be unwise to bet on it .", 
                "most mps and peers who voted remain accept that the result of the referendum should be honoured .", 
                "4 - but the chances of brexit being soft '' not hard '' have increased significantly .", 
                "there is a majority for a soft '' brexit in parliament and , if there is a bill , it will now have the chance to exercise leverage .", 
                "5 - there is now a real possibility that theresa may will not be able to trigger article 50 before the end of march .", 
                "the government says it still intends to meet this deadline , but the need to legislate could lead to a delay .", 
                "6 - an early election , though by no means inevitable , now does look more likely than it did this time yesterday .", 
                "that 's all from me for today .", 
                "i had been intending to cover other stories , but i 'm afraid this one took over .",

                "the judgment looks , at early glance , to be almost appeal-proof .", 
                "it was made unanimously by three experienced appeal judges , sitting exceptionally at first instance : they are the lord chief justice , the master of the rolls and the leading public law judge at the court of appeal .", 
                "it is reasoned and detailed .", 
                "at one point , the court appears to hold that the government 's case was too weak to win on its own terms , regardless of the claimants ' case .", 
                "why did the government lose ?", 
                "it seems that the crucial issue is the impact on the rights of citizens .", 
                "if the article 50 notification is irrevocable then the argument is that these rights will be removed automatically in due course .", 
                "this can not be done , other than by an act of parliament .", 
                "the government could have side-stepped this difficulty by not accepting that the notification was irrevocable ( and many , including lord kerr who wrote article 50 of the lisbon treaty , say a notification must be revocable ) .", 
                "but it saw this legally sensible move as politically unacceptable .", 
                "looking at the judgment , the impression is that the government 's concession on this crucial point determined the outcome of the case .", 
                "jolyon maugham , the barrister and legal writer , says in a financial times article that if the government loses its appeal , theresa may will not be able to trigger article 50 by the end of march as she hopes .", 
                "imagine this .", 
                "it is november 2018 .",

                "the public mood towards brexit has turned ugly , and so have negotiations with our biggest and nearest trading partner .", 
                "in that world , any rational mp would wish that , back in november 2016 , she had left ajar the door to remaining in the eu .", 
                "why make the decision now , with modest evidence , if you have the opportunity to make it later with more ?", 
                "these points will be debated in the commons and they must also be debated in the lords .", 
                "and , in practical terms , it is difficult to contemplate that these steps - drafting a bill , debating it in the commons , voting on amendments , placing it before the house of lords and then addressing amendments introduced by the upper chamber in the commons again - can sensibly be taken after the result of the supreme court appeal is known but before march .", 
                "so , whatever else the decision means , unless the supreme court overturns the high court 's decision , theresa may 's march deadline will be ancient history .",

                "both the commons and lords have a majority of members who argued for the uk to remain a member of the eu .", 
                "but politically , they may not wish to vote against the decision of uk voters taken through the referendum , particularly as most constituencies outside the scotland , northern ireland and the major cities voted against remaining in the eu .", 
                "nonetheless , they will wish to ensure that the decision to trigger article 50 receives an appropriate degree of parliamentary scrutiny .", 
                "depending on how the bill is drafted - and it is likely to be very short - there may be moves to amend it to place conditions on the government before it can trigger article 50 .", 
                "these could take the form of timing or process requirements - for example , a requirement on the government to provide parliament with information about its negotiating position before triggering article 50 .", 
                "albert sanchez-graells , a law lecturer , says on his eu economic law blog that he thinks the appeal to the supreme court will lead to the european court of justice ( or the court of justice of the european union - cjeu ) getting involved .", 
                "now , in case of an appeal of the high court 's decision before the uksc , in my opinion , the referral to the cjeu is legally unavoidable ( i will not deal for now with arguments of judicial politics or pragmatic views on the uksc 's likely course of action ) .", 
                "even if the parties do not challenge or even raise to the uksc 's consideration the matter of the ( ir ) reversibility of and article 50 notification , it is a logical given that the uksc needs to take a stance ( even if implicit ) on this point in order to be able to rule on the case .", 
                "if it quashes the high court 's decision , it needs to clarify the points of law which the high court would have gotten wrong-one of which concerns the irrevocability of an art 50 notification .", 
                "if it upholds the high court 's decision , it is ( implicitly ) accepting the assumption that an art 50 notification is irrevocable .", 
                "either way , the uksc can not escape a substantial ( implicit ) consideration of the interpretation of article 50 .", 
                "in my view , this engages the uksc 's obligation to request a preliminary ruling from the cjeu under article 267 ( 3 ) tfeu and not doing so triggers a risk of infringement of eu law by the uk due to the acts ( or omission , in this case ) of its highest court .", 
                "sam hooper at semi-partisan politics says leave campaigners should not worry too much about the judgment .",

                "i mean , i remember seeing stories about it on the news , but since i was only eight years old the political ramifications of what i was seeing rather eluded me .", 
                "but despite my hazy memory , i think it is safe to say were mps ( and it would have to include many labour mps representing constituencies which voted to leave the eu ) to vote against giving the government authority to invoke article 50 , the resulting conflagration would make the poll tax riots look like a summer on hampstead heath .", 
                "robert peston , the itv political editor , says on facebook that brexiteers are guilty of hypocrisy .", 
                "it is spectacularly delicious that leading brexiteers are arguing that the high court today got it wrong today in ruling that we can not leave the eu without the assent of parliament - in that almost their entire campaign to get us out of the eu was that british courts and westminster must be sovereign , and no longer subjugated to brussels .",

                "that general rule exists precisely because the exercise of such prerogative powers has no effect on domestic law , including as laid down by parliament in legislation [ 18-36 ] .", 
                "8 - in the present case , however , the government accepts , and indeed positively contends , that if notice is given under article 50 it will inevitably have the effect of changing domestic law .",

                "9 - the central contention of the government in the present case is that parliament must be taken to have intended when it enacted the 1972 act that the crown would retain its prerogative power to effect a withdrawal from the community treaties ( now the eu treaties ) , and thereby intended that the crown should have the power to choose whether eu law should continue to have effect in the domestic law of the uk or not [ 76-81 ] .",
