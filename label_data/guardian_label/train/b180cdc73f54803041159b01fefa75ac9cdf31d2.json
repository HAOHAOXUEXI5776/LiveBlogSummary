                "good morning from new hampshire , with one day to go before the crucial primary which could see donald trump and bernie sanders convert their insurgencies against the party establishments into electoral success .", 
                "for some of the republican candidates , such as new jersey governor chris christie , ohio governor john kasich and former florida governor jeb bush , a poor showing tomorrow could be the end of their presidential ambitions .", 
                "the real clear politics polling average has trump ahead by 17 points , with florida senator marco rubio , texas senator ted cruz and kasich jostling for a fairly distant second .", 
                "the polls could be wrong , as they were in iowa , but they would have to be very wrong to deny the new york businessman and reality tv star victory .", 
                "for the democrats , sanders is nearly 13 points ahead of hillary clinton , although once the race moves to south carolina and further afield the former secretary of state , for now at least , has substantial leads over the vermont senator .", 
                "snow is forecast here throughout the day , which might affect the candidates ' plans as they attempt to crisscross the state after a bit of a break for the super bowl on sunday evening .", 
                "well , some of them had a break .", 
                "other campaign staff found it harder to take time out : alex conant ( @ alexconant ) almost every super bowl commercial so far has urged americans to embrace the future .", 
                "bad news for @ twitterid .", 
                "good news for @ twitterid josh schwerin ( @ joshschwerin ) almost every super bowl commercial so far has been 30 seconds and pre-scripted .", 
                "good news for @ twitterid the pro-rubio conservative solutions pac and the pro-bush right to rise super pac also interrupted the coronation of beyonc\u00e3\u00a9 as super bowl champion in new hampshire at least with an ad for rubio featuring jaunty seinfeld-type music ( perhaps aiming to take the sanders vote ) , and an ad for bush starring his brother george w , which i would have considered a slightly risky move .", 
                "he must have been elevated to the status of national treasure without me noticing .", 
                "he knows how to bring the world together against terror , noted w , reassuringly he should know !", 
                "as usual , guardian staff will be fanning out across the state all day , with lauren gambino following clinton , ben jacobs on the trail of trump , sabrina siddiqui catching up with rubio and dan roberts spending time with sanders , ending the day at a concert in durham featuring the dreaded vermont jam band phish .", 
                "i 'm feeling the bern as much as the next crazed sandernista , but you would have to pay me the combined income of the entire 99 % to get me to that gig .", 
                "instead , tom mccarthy and i will catch up with cruz this afternoon and trump tonight in manchester .", 
                "jonathan freedland will be catching as many events as he can , too .", 
                "stick with us for live coverage throughout the day ."
