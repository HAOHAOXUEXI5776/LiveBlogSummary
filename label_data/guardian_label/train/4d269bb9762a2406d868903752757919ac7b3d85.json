                "here is a summary of the key points in iain duncan smith 's statement .", 
                "duncan smith said the child poverty act was flawed because it did not take into account measures to improve life chances , education , or the importance of work as a route out of poverty .", 
                "he said he would replace the child poverty act targets with legislation giving the government a duty to report on progress against other indicators .", 
                "but he did not describe these as targets .", 
                "he said : today , i am announcing that we will bring forward legislation to remove the existing measures and targets in the child poverty act , as well as the other duties and provisions .", 
                "however , the legislation will at the same time introduce a statutory duty to report on measures of : worklessness and educational attainment the worklessness measures will identify the proportion of children living in workless households , and the proportion of children in long-term workless households .", 
                "the educational attainment measures will focus on gcse attainment for all pupils and for disadvantaged pupils .", 
                "the worklessness and education measures will reflect the agreed responsibilities in the devolution agreement .", 
                "he said the government would continue to publish the annual households below average income ( hbai ) figures ( the conventional poverty figures ) .", 
                "he said new measures would also be developed relating to the root causes of poverty '' .", 
                "alongside the statutory measures , we will develop a range of other indicators to measure the progress against the root causes of poverty .", 
                "we know that in households with unstable relationships , where debt and addiction destabilise families , where parents lack employment skills , that these children do n't have the same chances in life as other children .", 
                "they can not break out of the cycle of disadvantage .", 
                "we are currently developing these measures , including family breakdown , problem debt , and drug and alcohol dependency .", 
                "we will report each year on these life chances measures as well .", 
                "he said the social mobility and child poverty commission would become the social mobility commission .", 
                "he said the relative income measure of child poverty was unsatisfactory .", 
                "the problem with a statutory framework set around the relative income measure has become all too apparent .", 
                "at 60 % of median income : if you sit below the line , you are said to be poor .", 
                "if you sit above it , you are not .", 
                "he said focusing on relative income led the last labour to spend money inefficiently .", 
                "for example , we saw massive spikes in tax credit spending in the run up to election years : in the 2 years before the 2005 election it increased by nearly \u00a3 10bn in the 2 years before the 2010 election it increased by nearly \u00a3 6bn from 2002 to 2010 , spending on tax credits more than doubled , from \u00a3 14bn to \u00a3 31bn most of this due to child tax credit .", 
                "looking at welfare overall - spending increased by 60 % in real terms under the last government .", 
                "driven by the need to chase a moving line .", 
                "but , despite all this , the number of workless households doubled under labour and in-work poverty rose , he said .", 
                "he said focusing on relative poverty also meant that positive developments in the economy could increase poverty .", 
                "we had reached the position where a growing economy drives increases in the measure of child poverty whilst , if the economy crashes as happened under labour , child poverty apparently falls .", 
                "even today , if we increase the state pension we run the risk of increasing the median income and thus increasing the number of households in poverty .",
