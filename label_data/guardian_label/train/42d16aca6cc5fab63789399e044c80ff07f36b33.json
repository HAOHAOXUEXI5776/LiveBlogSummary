                "a meeting of eurozone finance ministers in brussels representing the country 's main creditors agreed to launch the new bailout with \u20ac26bn being disbursed next week following six months of bitter recrimination that almost saw the country , under the leftwing government of alexis tsipras , becoming the first to exit the single currency .",
