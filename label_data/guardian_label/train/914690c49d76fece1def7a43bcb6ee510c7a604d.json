                "the record-shattering results of the iowa caucuses are finally in , and as the presidential candidates who survived the night make their way to new hampshire ahead of next week 's primaries , bleary-eyed politicos are still trying to make sense of a caucus that trounced expectations , entrance polls and common sense .", 
                "two candidates have officially dropped out , another abandoned his campaign to go back home to get fresh clothes , and almost every pre-caucus poll has been proven wrong .", 
                "here 's a quick catchup on where each of the major candidates stand after tonight and what the caucus results mean for them : texas senator ted cruz won the night on the republican side almost handily with 99.9 % of votes in , cruz held a 27.7 % to 24.3 % lead over billionaire ( former ? )", 
                "frontrunner donald trump , with fellow freshman senator marco rubio pulling in 23.1 % , nearly double what the most accurate polls had predicted .", 
                "in the democratic camp , former secretary of state hillary clinton is locked in a virtual tie with vermont senator bernie sanders .", 
                "the associated press and multiple outlets deemed the race too close to call , although results announced by the state democratic party early tuesday morning gave clinton the win .", 
                "clinton was awarded 699.57 state delegate equivalents , versus 695.49 for sanders , the closest results in the history of iowa 's democratic caucuses .", 
                "despite clinton and cruz 's ( apparent ) victories , the top-tier candidates of both campaigns will walk out of iowa in a delegate tie iowa 's 44 democratic delegates will be split evenly between clinton and sanders , and its 30 republican delegates will be split roughly into thirds for cruz , trump and rubio .", 
                "both clinton and sanders gave what amounted to victory speeches last night the clinton campaign even declared victory , despite the hair 's breadth of the differential in their delegate count .", 
                "it looks like we are in a virtual tie , said sanders .", 
                "i stand here tonight , breathing a big sigh of relief , said clinton .", 
                "two candidates suspended their campaigns following the caucuses : former maryland governor martin o'malley on the democratic side , and former arkansas governor mike huckabee on the republican side ."
