                "it is possible that by the end of the day he may have resigned .", 
                "only a few weeks ago labour mps were discounting the possibility of a leadership challenge .", 
                "that was partly because labour 's performance in the local elections was not as bad as some people as predicted , but also because a yougov survey of labour members in may showed that corbyn was even more popular with members in may than he was when he was elected in september last year .", 
                "it said 64 % of members would vote for him in another contest .", 
                "so what has changed ?", 
                "two factors are crucial .", 
                "first , there is general consensus that corbyn 's performance in the eu referendum campaign was lacklustre .", 
                "labour party members ( unlike labour voters ) are strongly in favour of eu membership , and it is widely felt that corbyn did not pull his weight .", 
                "this politico.eu long read puts the case against him well .", 
                "a measure of how much unhappiness this has caused is the fact that corbyn was heckled when he spoke at pride yesterday .", 
                "and , second , the vote for leave in the eu referendum has made the prospect of an early election much more likely , the conservative party is due to elect a new leader by october , and it is thought that the new prime minister will want a fresh electoral mandate - particularly if he or she thinks labour is in a weak position .", 
                "in theory the fixed-term parliaments act means that there will not be a general election until 2020 , but a vote of two-thirds of mps can over-ride that ."

                "jeremy paxman , writing in the telegraph , says the brexit result has exposed a gaping chasm : the political leaders of any of the main parties have more in common with each other than they have with many of their foot-soldiers , and the referendum has made that plain .", 
                "this is clearly one of those issues ( capital punishment is always said to be another ) on which the governing class and the people they purport to represent are entirely at odds .", 
                "david cameron knew that a referendum was a constitutional nonsense , and that potentially one day a house of commons overwhelmingly made up of people who believe in the european union would have to pass the laws to leave it .", 
                "anne mcelvoy in the mail on sunday says pro-brexit voters who wanted an end to free movement might not get their wish : less than an hour after cameron announced he would stand down , i interviewed philip hammond , the foreign secretary .", 
                "he knows the realities and constraints of our eu dealings inside out .", 
                "the price of free trade access to europe 's large single market will , he told me , be retaining freedom of movement with only cosmetic tweaks .", 
                "without that commitment the eu has no reason to keep trade with britain free of barriers that will do us severe economic damage .", 
                "that might not be what the jubilant brexiteers want to hear this weekend .", 
                "it is nonetheless true .", 
                "boris johnson : outwards and upwards .", 
                "nicholls/reuters you 've likely already clicked to it , but nick cohen in the observer is excoriating on boris johnson and michael gove : the media do not damn themselves , so i am speaking out of turn when i say that if you think rule by professional politicians is bad , wait until journalist politicians take over .", 
                "johnson and gove are the worst journalist politicians you can imagine \u0080\u00a6 never has a revolution in britain 's position in the world been advocated with such carelessness .", 
                "the leave campaign has no plan .", 
                "and that is not just because there was a shamefully under-explored division between the bulk of brexit voters who wanted the strong welfare state and solid communities of their youth and the leaders of the campaign who wanted britain to become an offshore tax haven .", 
                "vote leave did not know how to resolve difficulties with scotland , ireland , the refugee camp at calais , and a thousand other problems , and did not want to know either .", 
                "the day in a tweet jim waterson ( @ jimwaterson ) realistic chance of uk 's two main political parties both having leadership elections at same time during moment of constitutional crisis .", 
                "and the greens are having their own leadership contest , too , though of course it 's all rather more civil .", 
                "if today were a blur song it would be sunday sunday : tv , old soldiers , talk of the past , two world wars , the england he knew is now no more , songs of praise , sleep .", 
                "and another thing would you like to wake up to this briefing in your inbox ?",
