                "he also suggested the government wanted to clarify the law on prerogative powers generally , not least because they cover decisions like going to war .", 
                "he said that , although the high court ruling implied that the government had to pass primary legislation to be allowed to trigger article 50 , the supreme court ruling could say something different .", 
                "he was responding to questions about whether parliament would have to pass a bill to allow the government to trigger article 50 , or whether just passing a resolution ( a quicker , easier process ) would be enough if the government loses its appeal to the supreme court .", 
                "he defended the independence of the judiciary , although he refused to condemn those newspapers that attacked the high court judges for their article 50 ruling .",

                "he said : the right to demonstrate is another of our freedoms but i 'd say this - one of the great things about our supreme court , indeed all our courts , is it would n't matter how many people march , it would n't move their judgments by one comma .",
