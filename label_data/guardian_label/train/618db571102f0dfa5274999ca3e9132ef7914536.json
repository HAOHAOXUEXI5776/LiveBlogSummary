                "and with that , the final white house correspondents ' dinner of the obama administration came to an end with , if not raucous cheers , not exactly the hostile reception past comedians have received .", 
                "you ca n't say that larry wilmore killed : his humor as it normally is was a bit more of the wait-did-he-really-say-that variety , which is definitely not in keeping with the ty whcd crowd which tends to think that he perhaps ought not to have said it .", 
                "and , wilmore 's jibes at cnn 's wolf blitzer and don lemon , msnbc 's morning show juggernaut morning joe and the death of print journalism ( all to well-covered at the event in past years , but normally by the president ) were pretty unpopular with the likely inebriated crowd , earning him a couple of loud boos from folks who probably ought to have known better .", 
                "laughing at himself is a skill the president managed to perfect at these things over the years ; it 's one that not all the journalists in attendance seem to have mastered ( though don lemon pasted a smile on and waved at the crowd ) .", 
                "at least his reception was n't so poor that , like the year after colbert made fun of george w bush , the association will be tempted to find the most banal , grandparent-friendly comedian possible .", 
                "and next year will bring a new president : the question now is whether that president will be able to laugh at him or herself , and how much material with which she or he will give the host to work ."

                "good evening , and welcome to the guardian 's live coverage of the nerd prom , the not-quite self-deprecating nickname for the annual white house correspondents dinner .", 
                "this will be barack obama 's final turn at telling jokes behind the podium and the current election cycle has given him plenty of fodder for his routine , which generally consists of zingers at other politicians ' expense , jibes at members of his administration and newsy references that would be cut from saturday night live 's weekend update for being not funny enough .", 
                "he 'll be followed by comedian and host larry wilmore , host of comedy central 's the nightly show , a the daily show spin-off for the former tds correspondent .", 
                "wilmore has a ty tough job : to be funny without being offensive to the assembled politicians and media types , many of whom have an inflated sense of self a sense not reduced by being in the presence of bona fide celebrities .", 
                "guests this year include one of obama 's would-be successor , bernie sanders , as well as aretha franklin , ilana goldblum , ilana glazer , will smith and rachel mcadams .", 
                "infamously , the last former tds corespondent to host the dinner , steven colbert , bombed with the in-crowd , though he killed with viewers at home , in 2006 because he performed in character from the colbert report and did n't pull his punches about then president george w bush , the wars he 'd started or his cozy relationship with the media .", 
                "wilmore is n't expected to be as pointed about the incumbent president , but one suspects he has more than enough material on the potential next president with which to work .", 
                "but before that , join us for coverage of the red carpet , a little commentary from patrick gavin , director of the documentary nerd prom : the movie and a look at what else is going on in the world that is probably more important than the sight of media types back-slapping with the politicians they 'll supposedly go back to holding to account tomorrow .", 
                "( and maybe some intel about carrie fisher 's dog , which is supposedly going to be seated with the general herself at the guardian 's table . )", 
                "cspan is airing the whole event live on its site , and several cable news networks plan to cover it as well .", 
                "at 6pm et there will be a red carpet rolled out for stars of hollywood , tv and music , political journalists of all stripes , and some of washington 's most powerful politicians .", 
                "around 7.30pm the action will quiet , as everyone turns to the plates in front of them .", 
                "and it revs back up again at about 9.45pm , when the president and wilmore take the stage ."
