                "in a snub to boris johnson , the mayor of london and a potential rival to may for the tory leadership , she said that the three water cannon he had bought second-hand from germany for london were not in a fit condition to be deployed and that allowing water cannon would undermine the principle of policing by consent .", 
                "johnson spent \u00a3 218,000 on the machines .", 
                "harriet harman , the interim labour leader , has accused the prime minister of rigging the rules '' by changing the law on trade union political funds while leaving untouched the way companies and hedge fund managers are free to provide unlimited funds to the conservative party .",

                "he said : it is not for britain to bail out eurozone countries and we would n't do that .", 
                "but as a member of the european union , if greece were , for instance , to leave the euro and wanted humanitarian assistance , i 'm sure that this house and the british public would take a more generous view .", 
                "sorting out the problems of the eurozone , which we have always warned about the dangers of this eurozone , is a matter for eurozone countries .", 
                "cameron has said he will consider whether to impose a blanket ban on prisoners who have absconded from an open prison ever being placed back into the lower security jails ever again .",

                "in a major speech on the economy , he said : before the election labour rightly highlighted the plight of those pushed into self-employment due to a lack of secure work .",

                "labour has always been the workers ' party , and in the 21st century that means labour must be the party of the self-employed too .", 
                "so under my leadership these vital members of the workforce will no longer be an afterthought - every policy will be considered for its impact on them , and we will study ways to reform universal credit and other government programmes to ensure that they address the needs of the self-employed as well as those in traditional employment .",

                "the original police request argued that water cannon offered a flexible option to disperse crowds , protect premises and deter disruptive behaviour that might otherwise have to be dealt with by forcible means .", 
                "however , it made clear that water cannon has limitations , especially in response to fast , agile disorder .",
