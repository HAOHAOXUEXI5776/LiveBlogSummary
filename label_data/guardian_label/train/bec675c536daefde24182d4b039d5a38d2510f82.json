                "starting off with the early morning release of a tabloid magazine 's unsourced , unverified accusations of marital infidelity against texas senator ted cruz , the republican primary quickly became a badminton game of escalating insults between cruz and billionaire republican frontrunner donald trump , except instead of a shuttlecock , it was the american public 's dignity being batted back and forth .", 
                "without further ado , here 's a roundup of the biggest stories in american political news today : ted cruz called out the national enquirer story that alleges he had affairs with five different women as garbage .", 
                "speaking to reporters after a campaign event in oshkosh , wisconsin , cruz said the story is full of complete and utter lies and is a tabloid smear that has come from rival frontrunner donald trump and his former political adviser roger stone .", 
                "in a statement , donald trump said he had absolutely nothing to do with the national enquirer story .", 
                "using a nickname he has given cruz on the campaign trail , trump added : unlike lyin ' ted cruz i do not surround myself with political hacks and henchman and then pretend total innocence .",

                "after the the attacks , trump repeated his call for a temporary ban on muslims from entering the united states and for the expanded use of torture a lot more than waterboarding , he called it on detainees .",

                "but privately , weaver says , the cruz camp acknowledges that it can not hit the delegates goal , and yet refuses to work with kasich to divvy up turf where each has the best chance of beating the frontrunner .",
