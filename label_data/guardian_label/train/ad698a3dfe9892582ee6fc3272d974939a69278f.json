                "andy burnham , the shadow home secretary , has said that labour will not play politics with the investigatory powers bill .", 
                "explaining why the party would be abstaining on the bill when mps vote at second reading this evening , he said the party was not ready to support it yet .", 
                "the government 's bill is not yet worthy of support because there are significant weaknesses in this bill .", 
                "but he also it would be irresponsible for labour to vote against it .", 
                "the simple fact is britain needs a new law in this area .", 
                "outright opposition , which some are proposing tonight , risks sinking this bill and leaving the interim laws in place .", 
                "to go along with that would be to abdicate our responsibility to the police , security services and , most of all , the public , and i 'm not prepared to do that i am not seeking to play politics with this bill or to drag it down .", 
                "he said it was lazy and insulting to refer to the bill as the snooper 's charter .", 
                "i do not think our mission is helped by misrepresentation .", 
                "in my view it is lazy to label this bill a snooper 's charter , or a plan for mass surveillance .", 
                "in fact , it is worse ; it is insulting to people who work in the police and in the security services .", 
                "it implies that they choose to do the jobs that they do because they are busybodies who like to spy on the public rather than serve the public .", 
                "well , i do n't accept that characterisation of those people .", 
                "it is unfair and it diminishes the difficult work that they do to keep us safe .", 
                "theresa may , the home secretary , has described the bill as world-leading .", 
                "opening the debate , she said : this bill will provide world-leading legislation , setting out in detail the powers available to the police and intelligence services to gather and access communications and communications data .", 
                "she also said it had been improved since it was published in draft last year .", 
                "the revised bill is clearer , with tighter technical definitions and strict codes of practice .", 
                "it includes stronger privacy safeguards , bolstering protections for lawyers and journalists ' sources .", 
                "it explicitly prevents our agencies from asking foreign intelligence agencies to intercept the communications of a person in the uk on their behalf unless they have a warrant approved by the secretary of state and a judicial commissioner .", 
                "it reduces the amount of time in which urgent warrants must be reviewed by a judicial commissioner , cutting it from five days to three , and it strengthens the powers of the new investigatory powers commissioner .", 
                "may has claimed that privacy is hard-wired into the bill .", 
                "in its scrutiny of the draft bill , the intelligence and security committee quite rightly concluded that privacy protection should form the backbone of legislation in this most sensitive area .", 
                "that is indeed the case and privacy is hard-wired into the bill .", 
                "it strictly limits the public authorities that can use investigatory powers , imposes high thresholds for the use of the most intrusive powers , and sets out in more detail than ever before the safeguards that apply to material obtained under those powers .", 
                "that 's all from this blog for today .", 
                "later i will be launching a new blog to cover tonight 's guardian events eu debate , with nigel farage , nick clegg , andrea leadsom and alan johnson .",

                "this is significant because some leave campaigners , particularly in ukip , have been highlighting the prospect of turkey joining the eu as a strong argument for leaving .", 
                "johnson also suggested that he would like the uk to become an associate member of the eu along with turkey .",
