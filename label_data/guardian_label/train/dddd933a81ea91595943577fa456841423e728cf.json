            "text": [
                "philip hammond , the chancellor , was once seen as a fairly hardline eurosceptic but the westminster kaleidoscope has been shaken so vigorously over the last six months that he has now emerged as the pro-europeans ' best hope in cabinet .", 
                "he did not say anything sensational or indiscreet in his evidence to the select committee , but for someone committed to giving no running commentary '' on brexit , he was surprisingly candid .", 
                "here are the key points .", 
                "hammond said the government should keep its brexit options as open as possible and he appeared to criticise his brexiteer colleague who are adopting a more hardline stance .", 
                "he argued that keeping options open was a good negotiating strategy .", 
                "i am trying not to rule anything out .", 
                "every possible combination should be considered , because i genuinely believe that every time we rule something out we hand a negotiating chip to the opposite side of the table .", 
                "keeping as many things on the table as possible is the best negotiating stance .", 
                "and , in remarks that seemed aimed at colleagues like liam fox , the international trade secretary , he suggested that taking a firm stance against the single market or the customs union would be mistake .", 
                "[ theresa may ] needs the maximum possible space .", 
                "my objective in supporting her is to ensure that she has the broadest range of options - properly costed and understood - and the maximum scope to deploy that broad range of options in what might be a wide-ranging negotiation .", 
                "i would say that those that are undermining the effort are those that are seeking to close down that negotiating stance , seeking to arrive at hard decisions that we do n't need at this stage .", 
                "keeping as many areas open , as many options open , as possible is the key to the strongest possible negotiating hand .", 
                "when it was put to him that the very existence of the international trade department suggested the uk would leave the customs union ( because if the uk remains in the customs union , it will not be able to negotiate separate trade deals ) , hammond said that many eu countries have trade ministries even though they are inside the customs union '' and that ministers in fox 's department were promoting british trade '' .", 
                "he said he there were deeply pragmatic '' at the top of the eu who would enable the uk and the eu to find a mutually beneficial '' solution to brexit .", 
                "there has been quite a lot of position taking , as one would expect , at this stage of the negotiation .", 
                "but i remain optimistic that there are , at very senior level across the european union , some deeply pragmatic people who have shown by their actions time and again that they can find solutions when challenged with problems .", 
                "and if we look at the history of the eu , how many times have people said there is no way through this problem or that problem ?", 
                "and yet the eu has been able to find a way through it .", 
                "and i hope that pragmatism and engagement will deliver us a mutually beneficial solution .", 
                "he was criticised by mps after saying he would not publish internal treasury reports analysing the costs and benefits of brexit .", 
                "to do so would undermine the uk 's negotiating position , he claimed .", 
                "but labour 's rachel reeves said this stance was disappointing '' .", 
                "and andrew tyrie , the committee chair , said most members of the committee would probably agree with reeves on this .", 
                "he ruled out scotland being able to negotiate its own trade deal with the eu .", 
                "it was for the uk as a whole to strike a trade deal , he said .", 
                "he said other eu countries would not want a brexit deal that damaged the city because that would be bad for europe as a whole .", 
                "perceptions on the continent that other european financial centres were likely to gain if london lost access to eu markets were likely to melt away '' as people realised that uk jobs were more likely to go to the us , or disappear , than to go to other european countries , he said .", 
                "london was europe 's financial services centre as well as the uk 's , he said .", 
                "anything which broke up this deep and broad pool of capital and expertise in london would be hugely detrimental to the real economy across the eu as well as the uk .", 
                "he said city firms were starting to be realistic '' about the likelihood of them not being able to retain the passporting '' regime that allowed them to operate in other eu countries .", 
                "he said it in such a way as to imply he thought they were right to be realistic '' and to start considering alternatives .", 
                "he said the uk would not impose immigration controls that stopped banks hiring highly-skilled workers from abroad after brexit .", 
                "he said the predictions that treasury made about the negative impact of brexit before the referendum were partly based on assumptions that were no longer valid .", 
                "the bbc 's kamal ahmed has written more about this .", 
                "kamal ahmed ( @ bbckamal ) hammond sounds the death knell on `` project fear '' my economics blog he said britain might have to beef up border controls considerably after brexit .", 
                "asked if it was true that an additional 5,000 customs officers would be needed were correct , hammond replied : it would be our choice , of course , but assuming that we wanted to operate an efficient at-the-border customs system under world trade organisation rules , we may need significantly more infrastructure at the border than we have now .", 
                "he said the government would not change the way the bank of england decided monetary policy , despite theresa may appearing to criticise its policy of quantitative easing in her tory conference speech .", 
                "he said my understanding is that what the prime inister was trying to say is that we recognise that monetary policy , which is an important tool of macroeconomic policy , has a distributional impact .", 
                "and , to the extent the government believes that distributional impact needs to be addressed or corrected , we also have tools available to us to do that there will be no change in monetary policy .", 
                "monetary policy is independently determined , that will continue to be the case .", 
                "the monetary policy committee will continue to make decisions on interest rates and recommendations on unconventional monetary policy .", 
                "that 's all from me for today .", 
                "thanks for the comments ."
