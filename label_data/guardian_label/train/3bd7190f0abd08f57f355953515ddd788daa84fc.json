                "the debate that 's exploded during this contest has been simmering for many years when gordon brown took over from tony blair , we did n't have a proper debate about our party 's future , in part because there was n't a serious contest .", 
                "we did n't have it after the financial crash - even though the global economic crisis raised huge challenges for centre-left parties across europe - opening the door further to those who believe market economics was always bound to fail .", 
                "and we did n't have a genuine debate in the 2010 leadership contest , which ended up being dominated by the story of the rivalry between the miliband brothers , and because after ed won , we wanted to keep the party united .", 
                "a shared purpose is vital for political parties to succeed .", 
                "but that only comes after genuine discussion and debate , not by papering over the cracks , and by dealing with the difficult challenges facing your party , not by ignoring them or hoping they 'll go away .",

                "if you do n't use it , it weakens .",

                "but reform is also required because the global economy is leaving too many people behind , and the world of work now is very different to the one from which our party was formed .",

                "jon cruddas came out with one fairly harsh line about jeremy corbyn , but his whole interview was much more nuanced .", 
                "here is a summary of the main points .", 
                "i 've taken the quotes from politicshome .", 
                "cruddas said he was worried that labour under jeremy corbyn could turn into a trotskyist tribute act '' that would collapse '' in front of the electorate .", 
                "( see 9.08am . )", 
                "he said he disagreed with corbyn 's analysis about labour 's problem being that it was too pro-austerity at the election .", 
                "jeremy 's diagnosis is that labour is austerity-lite , '' he said .", 
                "now , that seems to me to be at odds with where the country is . ''", 
                "cruddas carried out his own review of the reasons for labour 's defeat which said one of the key problems for the party was that voters accepted the tory case for cutting the deficit .", 
                "he praised corbyn 's campaign for energising supporters .", 
                "[ corbyn is ] cutting through in ways that i did n't think were imaginable barely weeks away i did n't think he 'd have as much success as he obviously has and it has changed the whole character of the conversation and it needed to he has had an analysis of what happened in the election - we were austerity lite - and he 's come up with a policy-heavy , very disciplined campaign which has enthused people .", 
                "to give an example , my son rings me up at the beginning of the campaign and he says 'look , i 'm rejoining the party ' .", 
                "a couple of days later , my mum rings up , says she 's joining the party - something she 's equivocated over for nearly a decade .", 
                "they are enthused by something that 's going on in and around labour , which they have not been for a very long time .", 
                "cruddas explained why he had not yet voted .", 
                "( the interview was recorded yesterday . )", 
                "what i decided to do was wait until the very last minute to sort of consume everything that everyone 's trying to say and then try and make sense of it and make my mind up , because i still have n't made up my mind , really .", 
                "he said there was a growing gap between the labour membership and the public at large .", 
                "all the evidence shows that the nature of the labour membership is increasingly different to the nature of the society that we want to govern .", 
                "and that is difficult in terms of future prospects for the party , and that means that at some stage we 're going to have to pivot out of this leadership election and confront the realities in the country , which could be quite a salutary experience for us .", 
                "he suggested ed miliband should not have resigned so early .", 
                "it would have been better to have allowed time for the party to diagnose the nature of the defeat '' before having the leadership election , he said .", 
                "he said labour had to rehabilitate '' tony blair .", 
                "( cruddas worked for blair in number 10 before becoming an mp . )", 
                "at some stage , the labour party 's going to have to rehabilitate blair and his legacy .", 
                "and it goes beyond this simple caricature of what it was .", 
                "i mean , it was a rich , textured political project that had real grip in the country and that 's part of the crisis that is consuming us now because now he 's become some sort of figure to be demonised .",

                "yet , with voting in the leadership contest closing at midday today , cruddas told sarah montague , in an interview recorded yesterday , that he still had not decided how to vote .", 
                "maybe that just says something about the hopelessness of intellectuals , but it is more likely that cruddas was articulating the torn emotions that many in the party have about the jeremy corbyn anti-westminster insurgency .", 
                "cruddas , who nominated corbyn without fully backing his policies , conceded that the leftwing backbencher , who has become the surprise favourite , had energised the contest in a remarkable way .", 
                "but he also admitted that he was worried that a corbyn leadership could turn out to be a disaster .", 
                "i 'm worried that it might turn into quite a sort of early 80s tribute act , trotskyist tribute act which has the culture around it which is very hostile to anyone who just disagrees and it could just collapse in front of the electorate .", 
                "but i do n't think there 's any safe ground for labour anyway , so this is one strategy , it might not work , we 'll see .",

                "here 's the start of patrick 's story .", 
                "more than half of labour 's loyalist voters think it is more important to stick to the party 's principles than to temper those views to try to win an election , according to an opinion poll for the former conservative party deputy chairman lord ashcroft .", 
                "the poll also reveal a yawning gap between the views of labour loyalists and voters who defected to another party at the last election , especially on the issues of welfare , the economy and immigration .", 
                "ashcroft 's polling , conducted in the last fortnight and revealed to the guardian exclusively , confirms that ed miliband was one of the single biggest reasons why people who voted labour in 2010 decided not to vote for the party in 2015 .",
