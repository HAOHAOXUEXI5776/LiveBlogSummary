                "hello and welcome to our live-wire coverage of the 2016 race for the white house .", 
                "donald trump this morning is aggressively attacking hillary clinton over a meeting monday on a phoenix tarmac between bill clinton and attorney general loretta lynch .", 
                "lynch told reporters wednesday that it was a chance meeting restricted to small talk .", 
                "trump , however , detects a conspiracy , conceived by the clintons , to smooth hillary clinton 's way to the presidency by arranging for a secret meeting between bill clinton and the head of a justice department currently investigating hillary clinton 's use of a private email account and server during her time as secretary of state .", 
                "under pressure from the furor over the secret meeting , lynch plans to announce friday that she will in effect recuse herself from the case and accept whatever recommendation career prosecutors and federal agents make in the investigation into hillary clinton 's use of a private email server , a justice department official told the associated press on friday .", 
                "trump 's not wholly reassured .", 
                "does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence ?", 
                "he tweets .", 
                "donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) as bernie sanders said , hillary clinton has bad judgement .", 
                "bill 's meeting was probably initiated and demanded by hillary !", 
                "donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) bill clinton 's meeting was a total secret .", 
                "nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter .", 
                "donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) take a look at what happened w/ bill clinton .", 
                "the system is totally rigged .", 
                "does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence ?", 
                "here 's how lynch described the encounter at a news conference in los angeles wednesday scheduled to discuss community policing : he did come over and say hello , and speak to my husband and myself , and talk about his grandchildren and his travels and things like that .", 
                "that was the extent of that .", 
                "and no discussions were held into any cases or things like that .", 
                "the tempest , however , is already out of the teapot : evan smith ( @ evanasmith ) fine , but if the ag had n't accepted the recs of the fbi , would n't the optics on that have been worse ?", 
                "daveweigel ( @ daveweigel ) either way , we were going to get republicans demanding a special prosecutor , because clintons .", 
                "in non-clinton-conspiracy news , the veepstakes have not necessarily been reduced , on the republican side , to former house speaker newt gingrich and new jersey governor chris christie but the two men are being seriously vetted as potential trump running mates , according to many reports .", 
                "msnbc has this coverage this morning : morning joe ( @ morning joe ) gingrich & christie are being vetted for vp @ twitterid : trump is largely going to rely on his own instincts trump faces a significant fundraising deficit both inside his campaign and among the outside political groups that would support his candidacy .", 
                "potential and past donors retain reservations about the candidate , several told peter stone for the guardian : several donors backing trump told the guardian that the candidate 's errors are piling up .", 
                "he 's got to learn not to put his foot in his mouth , said stan hubbard , a billionaire broadcaster who has donated $ 100,000 to the pro-trump great america pac .", 
                "he needs a clearer message without name-calling .", 
                "hubbard also called trump 's recent trip to scotland where he was criticized for hailing the plunge in the pound post-brexit as good for his golf course there a mistake .", 
                "he should have let his kids do it .", 
                "likewise , potential super pac donors say trump badly needs to curb his bombastic rhetoric and craft a better message .", 
                "michael epstein , who raised big money for wisconsin governor scott walker and plans to vote for trump but also hold my nose and pray , said that he might back a super pac if trump has a strong gop convention next month and really turns it around .", 
                "but epstein added : i 'm less and less hopeful .", 
                "he ca n't get out of his own way .",
