                "good morning dual citizens , welcome to # politicslive , where too much excitement is never enough in the 45th parliament .", 
                "after the extraordinary developments of yesterday in which the deputy prime minister confirmed he might have a teensy citizenship problem australian politics has skiied off piste , one ski , no poles as paul keating would say .", 
                "this is because the turnbull government has a one0seat majority so the long white cloud hanging over barnaby joyce 's head has emboldened the opposition .", 
                "but first , according to rosie lewis of the oz , nick xenophon has conceded he never heard back from greek and cypriot authorities when he attempted to renounce any greek citizenship .", 
                "senator xenophon , who leads a crucial bloc of four mps , is pushing for an independent audit of the \u00e2\u00adeligibility of all members and senators , and said he would happily comply .", 
                "with a mother from greece and father from cyprus , senator xenophon declared he had never been a citizen of another country but acknowledged there was no written proof .", 
                "i 've never had , never sought , never received citizenship of another country but out of an abundance of caution i wrote to the greek embassy and cypriot high commission saying essentially , \u0080\u0098i 've never been a citizen , i do n't want to be , so if there 's any question that i could be , i renounce any rights to be ' .", 
                "i do n't know what else i can do in the circumstances , senator xenophon said .", 
                "but in the lower house , labor 's strategy is emerging , if you combine question time yesterday with this sabra lane 's interview with labor 's manager of opposition business tony burke .", 
                "labor is pushing for barnaby joyce to stand aside while the citizenship matter is resolved - as matt canavan has done in the senate .", 
                "at the same time , labor is in talks with the crossbench over two issues that were lost by one vote - penalty rates and the banking royal commission .", 
                "we are talking to them and they are the two issues we have been focusing on .", 
                "burke said the lower house resolved unanimously that it did not know whether joyce was eligible to sit .", 
                "a brave man , burke was supremely confident that labor mps are all g. he said the labor process goes through the country of birth of the candidate , their parents and grandparents .", 
                "burke said the examples of the greens , malcolm roberts , matt canavan and barnaby joyce would have been up by the labor process .", 
                "they are all examples that would have been easily caught by our process .", 
                "burke was also highly critical of malcolm turnbull 's emphatic assertion in parliament yesterday that the high court would clear joyce 's case .", 
                "he stood up and announced what conclusion the high court will reach they are clinging on to power and there is nothing more than that this is a government without legitimacy .", 
                "but attorney general george brandis said the prime minister had not challenged the separation of powers by declaring joyce was clear .", 
                "nowhere near it .", 
                "the prime minister who is himself an accomplished lawyer does n't need any instruction about the separation of powers as a lawyer he is entitled to inform his own view .", 
                "which is true , except as prime minister , he is also the head of the executive government .", 
                "but hey , i 'm no lawyer so what would i know .", 
                "stick with us - it will be a big day .", 
                "talk to me in the thread or on the twits @ twitterid or try facebook if that 's your bag ."
