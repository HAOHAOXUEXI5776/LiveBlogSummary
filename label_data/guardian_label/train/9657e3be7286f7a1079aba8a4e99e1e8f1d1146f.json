                "there would be one seven-party debate , involving cameron , one debate involving just minor parties , and two interview or question time programmes , which would involve cameron , ed miliband and nick clegg ( once ) being questioned on the same night , but not at the same time .",

                "cameron 's willingness to take part in a single tv debate , described by downing street earlier this month as its final offer '' , made it even more difficult for broadcasters to stage a debate without the prime minister .",
