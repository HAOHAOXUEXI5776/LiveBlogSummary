                "ewen bremner stumbled boggle-eyed into film folklore as spud in danny boyle 's trainspotting .", 
                "a speed-addled miscreant with an unerring gift for flunking job interviews , spud not only brought the skinny jean into fashion , but he also earned bremner critical acclaim and commercial attention .", 
                "many memorable film roles have followed , from harmony korine 's julien donkey-boy to black hawk down , and he also turned up in tom hooper 's tv miniseries elizabeth i as that most unspud-like scot , king james vi .", 
                "he 's currently appearing in wonder woman as a boozed-up first world war sharpshooter .", 
                "still , bremner 's defining character was never far away , and early this year he donned his trademark gawky spectacles again for boyle 's belated sequel t2 trainspotting .", 
                "if it slightly stretched credulity that spud had survived into the 21st century , it was nevertheless a treat to see him reunite with renton , sick boy and the gang again .", 
                "ewen bremner will join us live for a webchat from 1pm on monday 5 june to mark the dvd release of the film .", 
                "post your questions in the comments below , and he 'll take on as many as possible ."
