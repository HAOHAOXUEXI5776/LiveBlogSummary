                "stephanie kirchgaessner explains : the reforms , which would have affected a third of the italian constitution , had already been approved by parliament but by a slim margin , thus requiring that they also be passed by referendum .", 
                "under the current system , which was created under italy 's 1948 constitution , there are two chambers of parliament with directly elected lawmakers , the chamber of deputies and the senate .", 
                "both chambers have equal power it 's known as perfect bicameralism and both must agree on legislation before it is passed .", 
                "this means , put simply , that it can take a very long time for things to get done .", 
                "for example , a law to give children born out of wedlock the same rights as children of married couples took nearly 1,300 days to be approved .", 
                "under the proposed reforms , the senate would have lost almost all its power the number of senators would have been reduced from 315 to 100 , and the remaining senators would no longer be elected directly .", 
                "instead , the 100 would have been made up of lawmakers selected by regional assemblies .", 
                "some mayors would also serve as senators .", 
                "that would have meant that most laws could be passed , including italy 's budget , by the chamber of deputies without consulting the senate .", 
                "the senate would only have had the power to weigh in on big issues such as other constitutional reforms and the ratification of eu treaties .", 
                "some , but not all , constitutional experts believed the changes were essentially a power grab that would have made renzi , or whoever was sitting in palazzo chigi , much more powerful .", 
                "they argued that the changes would obliterate the delicate balance of power that was designed in 1948 by people who had witnessed the rise of fascism .", 
                "all of renzi 's political opponents on the left and the right were aligned against the constitutional reforms , in large part because they wanted to force his resignation ."

                "in italy , meanwhile , the prime minister , matteo renzi , has staked his political future on a constitutional reform referendum that he looks set to lose , potentially opening a path to power for the anti-establishment , anti-euro five star movement .", 
                "norbert hofer , whose far-right , anti-immigrant freedom party was founded by a former ss officer , and alexander van der bellen , the son of estonian refugees who is backed by the green party , are re-running their contest of last may .", 
                "austria 's constitutional court overturned the result of that , which van der bellen won by the narrowest of margins , due to irregularities in the processing of the postal vote .", 
                "recent polls suggest this time hofer may have the edge .", 
                "in italy , voters are giving their verdict on a raft of changes to the political system that will renzi argues streamline the decision-making process by reducing the power of the senate .", 
                "it 's all quite complicated , but what matters is that the prime minister has said he will resign if he loses .", 
                "that raises the prospect though by no means the certainty of political and economic instability and early elections that beppe grillo 's unpredictable , populist m5s could win , a prospect that alarms many in italy and beyond even if the chances of it actually forming a government are not great .", 
                "but while the actual consequences are far from clear , after the uk 's shock brexit vote and donald trump 's upset win in the us presidential election , victory for hofer and defeat for renzi would at the very least mark two more big steps forward for the anti-establishment , nation-first parties challenging the political mainstream across europe .", 
                "and with pivotal elections and populist , eurosceptic advances , perhaps triumphs coming up next year in several eu member states including the netherlands , france and germany , there is a real chance that historians will look back on tonight 's events as the beginning of the end of the european project in its current form .", 
                "the guardian 's berlin bureau chief , philip oltermann , and italy correspondent , stephanie kirchgaessner , are in vienna and rome and will be contributing their insights throughout what could well be a long evening .",
