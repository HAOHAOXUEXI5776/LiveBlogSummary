                "we have the ability to turn back boats where it 's safe to do so and it 's the policy of both government and opposition in this country to continue regional processing because we know that it works in stopping the boats .", 
                "now we are working with third countries to try and provide alternative arrangements but we have been very clear and i repeat this today , because the people smugglers listen to every word spoken in this place , spoken by premiers and other leaders around the country , let me be very clear to these people .", 
                "we will not be held to ransom , we will not be blackmailed into changing this policy because this policy has resulted in lives being saved .", 
                "and we are not going to retreat on what has been a successful policy because i 'm not going to preside over an arrangement which the greens presided over when they were in coalition with the rudd and gillard governments which saw children drown at sea .", 
                "i 'm not going to allow that to return .", 
                "we have said we will look at each case compassionately , on its merit , and we will decide in relation to those cases what is in the best interests of those children or of those families .", 
                "i 'm not going to conduct a situation , not going to preside over a situation where we have people self harming to come to hospitals in this country because they believe that is the route out into the australian community for australian citizenship .", 
                "now we know that we will provide medical assistance , including to this baby , and including to other people we have brought to this country and when the medical assistance has been provided , mr speaker , to that family or to that individual , the policy of this government , the policy of the opposition is that that person will return to nauru .", 
                "we will provide support and assistance to return people back to their country of origin if they have found to be not under protection and that is the policy we will continue because we are not going to allow the people smugglers to get back into business .", 
                "i 'll let you think on that , before i come back in the next post and share my thoughts ."
