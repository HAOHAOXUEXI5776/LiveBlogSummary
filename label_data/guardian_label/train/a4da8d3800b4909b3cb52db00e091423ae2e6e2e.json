                "for the conference , the most enjoyable bits came at the start , particularly the passage where he lacerated the daily mail .", 
                "labour politicians have been denouncing the tabloid press at conference for years , but rarely , if ever , has it been done with such confidence and humour .", 
                "it would be nice to think that next time , make it 28 pages ( see 12.52pm ) might be remembered as a press slapdown on a par with prerogative of the harlot .", 
                "his line about the conservatives discovering the magic money tree ( see 12.32pm ) was also exceptionally funny and well phrased and powerful because it contained an essential truth .", 
                "once corbyn got on to the broader politics , the fun was over .", 
                "this was n't a speech with any striking new policy the housing regeneration conditions stuff ( see 1.15pm ) sounded new , but one for the inside page but labour has only recently published a manifesto and this is not the time in the electoral cycle to start making firm proposals .", 
                "what was much more interesting , though , was the broad vision he set out about workplace democracy , and people power , and making public services and businesses accountable to the public .", 
                "( see 1.28pm . )", 
                "there was nothing specific here , but it was loaded with possibility .", 
                "corbyn has generally been seen as a command-and-control , old-style socialist .", 
                "here he was starting to sound like a leftwing advocate of david cameron 's big society .", 
                "it is not entirely clear how you can square this with some of his other goals ( as someone once said , in nimby england you can have a big housebuilding programme , or a big localisation programme , but you can not have both ) , but it will be very interesting to see if he tries .", 
                "corbyn 's passage at the end about the centre of politics moving , and politics catching up with the crash of 2008 ( see 1.41pm ) , was also well expressed .", 
                "it was probably the best version of the centre of politics has shifted argument i 've heard .", 
                "the case against the speech was that it did nothing to puncture the air of complacency hanging over this conference .", 
                "( see 11.32am . )", 
                "it was also not a speech that addressed difficult questions ( like the ones the party will have to face at some point over brexit ) or challenged its audience in any way .", 
                "but when you think how far corbyn 's leadership has come in the last two years , a bit of wallowing in self-congratulation seems understandable ."

                "you probably have to go back to 1997 to find a labour conference so devoid of meaningful division .", 
                "after tony blair 's first year as prime minister , conference became a showcase for divisions either within the leadership ( blair v brown ) , or between leadership and membership .", 
                "this year there has been a blast of harmony , to a large extent explained by the fact that 2 - internal opposition to corbyn in the party has collapsed .", 
                "that is not because all those mps and party members who were sceptical about him last year have seen the light .", 
                "in private many still have their doubts about the corbyn project , even though the election result did a lot to allay their fears .", 
                "but there is no trace of any alternative political agenda in the party in the moment , and no mps are making more than a half-hearted effort to articulate one .", 
                "the only exception is europe , where pro-europeans have been trying to mobilise against the leadership , but 3 - labour 's pro-corbynism trumps its pro-europeanism .", 
                "that was the significance of the conference decision on sunday not to have a meaningful vote ( to use the phrase coined by keir starmer in another contest - when talking about parliament 's final vote on the brexit deal ) on staying in the single market .", 
                "it did look like a classic , blair-era leadership stitch-up , but party members ( following the unofficial momentum whip ) voted overwhelmingly not to have a vote , as well as the trade unions , so it was a genuine democratic decision .", 
                "when your party members are doing your stitching up for you , you have achieved a level of control that even blair would have envied .", 
                "but , after some twitter venting on sunday night , labour 's pro-european largely went quiet possibly because they know that party policy is gradually sliding their way .", 
                "corbyn is refusing to rule out keeping the uk in the european economic area for good after brexit - perhaps because he is more interested in staying labour leader and becoming prime minister than in indulging his lifelong single market scepticism .", 
                "4 - labour has a genuine problem accepting it lost the general election .", 
                "collectively the party seems to be suffering from some sort of cognitive dissonance on this point , much to the amusement of journalists who have been been able to engage in projects like this .", 
                "sebastian payne ( @ sebastianepayne ) who won the general election ?", 
                "bizarre this needs asking but the responses are classic # lab17 given that expectations of what labour would achieve before the general election were so universally dire ( including amongst corbynites , although some of them seem to have forgotten this ) , this elation is understandable .", 
                "but it also means that 5 - labour appears complacent , and has not been thinking hard about what it needs to do to win the next election .", 
                "the sensible step for any party that has lost a general election is to hold a postmortem , work out what went wrong , and strategise about what needs to be done to gain those extra seats .", 
                "there has been almost no evidence of the party collectively doing any of that this week .", 
                "instead there is a widespread assumption that , now it has been established that corbyn is not an obvious electoral liability , labour is likely to win next time because the tories are floundering and all governments inevitably fall .", 
                "that may well turn out to be what happens , but there is no guarantee , and a more hard-headed party would be saying things intended to extend its electoral appeal .", 
                "that has not happened so far this week , although we are told that corbyn will use his speech later to address not just the party , but the nation at large .", 
                "6 - corbyn is so dominant that , not only does he face no challenge to his leadership , there is not even an obvious successor .", 
                "in most political parties , at any one time , there is someone generally identified as the next leader in waiting .", 
                "they often never become leader ( yvette cooper filled this slot for a few years in the miliband era ) , but their presence means the leader is always , to an extent , on probation .", 
                "corbyn , though , is so pre-eminent that the usual chatter about who might be the next leader is extremely muted .", 
                "the danger is that the party is starting to look like a personality cult .", 
                "it is n't , quite , but even if you acknowledge that there is an irony element in the oh , jeremy corbyn chanting that has become the conference anthem ( will it replace the red flag at the end of proceedings today ?", 
                ") , there is something just a little too north korean about it all .", 
                "7 - labour is now perhaps better understood as a party for the young than a party for the working class .", 
                "this is something we knew from the general election voting demographics but it has been dramatically illustrated in brighton by the thousands of young people turning up for the momentum-organised the world transformed ( twt ) events , an alternative progressive politics festival taking place alongside the conference .", 
                "it has been extremely well organised , and it has seen people queuing around the block to hear the kind of speakers who only attracted tiny audiences at fringe events a few years ago .", 
                "after just two years , twt now seems an integral part of labour conference .", 
                "8 - business is taking labour much more seriously .", 
                "after corbyn was first elected party leader , a lot of the corporate lobbyists who normally attend party conference stayed away .", 
                "they assumed they did not need to worry about preparing for a labour government .", 
                "but that has changed , and this year they are here in force .", 
                "they might not necessarily like labour much , but they feel the need to engage .", 
                "9 - corbyn is getting much , much better at handling the media .", 
                "he was elected leader because of his politics , not because he was good on tv , and until this year his broadcast interviews were often marred by policy clangers or tetchiness .", 
                "but over the last six months he has improved enormously , not least at the essential political skill of being able to sidestep tricky questions .", 
                "( remember how he handled andrew marr 's question about illegal strikes ? )", 
                "in this respect he is acting much more like a conventional politician , without having sacrificed his reputation for authenticity a rare achievement .", 
                "10 - labour 's transformation has not finished .", 
                "corbyn may have achieved complete dominance over the party , but reshaping it is still a work-in-progress and , behind the scenes , there is considerable nervousness amongst mps not sympathetic to corbyn about where the party will end up , and whether they will end up being deselected .", 
                "the party voted through some rule changes yesterday , but the founder of momentum has made it clear he would like to go further and a review of party democracy being carried out by corbyn 's political secretary katy clark which has received surprisingly little discussion at conference could end up being the vehicle by which this happens ."
