                "chris weston , chief market strategist for ig , says the day 's action so far has allowed traders to catch a much-needed breath '' : it still feels as though volatility can break out at any time and a quick 1-2 % move in us futures , nikkei , asx 200 or hang seng could materialise at any time .", 
                "of course , these sort of moves will happen when the us volatility index ( vix ) is at 36 % ( over double the year average ) and the asx vix is at 28 % ( year average 16 % ) .",

                "the extra liquidity injected into the banking system would be somewhere between rmb650 billion and rmb700 billion , which sits nicely with the recent use of shorter-term liquidity tools .", 
                "most understand this easing for what it is : a policy move aimed at counteracting the tightening of financial conditions caused by sizeable capital outflows .", 
                "this is not going to boost growth the focus now falls firmly back on the us , and specifically on new york fed president bill dudley , who will field questions from the press on the local and regional economies .", 
                "mr dudley 's views will be scrutinised by the market , and given the recent change in language last week from dennis lockhart ( the atlanta president ) , it 's hard to get a sense of whether he is going to give an indication of a september hike ."
