                "the working group was convened by the minister , at the behest of the prime minister , and was coordinated by professor james k. galbraith [ who has issued his own statement ] it is worth nothing ( he means noting ) that , prior to mr varoufakis ' comfirmation of the existence of the said working group , the minister was criticized widely for having neglected to make such contingency plans .",
