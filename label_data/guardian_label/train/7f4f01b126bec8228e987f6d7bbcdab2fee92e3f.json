            "text": [
                "ken livingstone , the former mayor of london and a member of the labour 's national executive committee , has been suspended from the party after making provocative comments seen as condoning antisemitism .", 
                "it is a significant move given that he is a longterm leftwing friend and ally of jeremy corbyn 's ( and the only truly successful leftwing british politician of modern times '' , according to the conservative commentator charles moore . )", 
                "livingstone made his remarks in a bbc radio london interview this morning , prompting more than a dozen labour mps , including shadow cabinet members chris bryant and seema malhotra , to denounce him publicly , calling for him to be suspended or expelled .", 
                "most of those speaking out are opposed to corbyn 's leadership and in part they seemed to be waging an anti-corbyn power struggle by proxy .", 
                "corbyn did respond to the pressure and announce livingtone 's suspension , pending an investigation .", 
                "livingstone has refused to retract his controversial comments .", 
                "whether or not he did say anything antisemitic remains a matter of dispute - he is adamant that he did not - and the main point he has been trying to make all day is that criticising israel is not the same as being antisemitic .", 
                "( see 12.10pm . )", 
                "but livingstone made two key mistakes in his key interview .", 
                "( see 11.01am for full details . )", 
                "first , he defended the facebook posts that led to labour mp naz shah being suspended from the party , saying there were not antisemitic , even though shah herself has apologised for them and accepts that they were antisemitic .", 
                "second , he made a bizarre comparison with hitler to try to explain away shah 's conduct .", 
                "he told bbc radio london .", 
                "it 's [ ie , shah 's comment ] completely over the top but it 's not antisemitism .", 
                "let 's remember when hitler won his election in 1932 , his policy then was that jews should be moved to israel .", 
                "he was supporting zionism - this before he went mad and ended up killing six million jews .", 
                "it is still not clear what point he was trying to make ; perhaps he was suggesting that if hitler could be a zionist , being anti-zionist could not be that objectionable .", 
                "who knows ?", 
                "we might learn more on saturday , when he is next due to speak in public , on his lbc phone-in .", 
                "but introducing hitler as part of the case for the defence in a controversy about antisemitism was at the very least remarkably crass .", 
                "corbyn has played down the controversy , saying that labour is not in crisis and that some of the criticism he is getting is coming from people worried about labour 's strength at grassroots level .", 
                "( see 5.28am . )", 
                "the labour mp john mann has been reprimanded by rosie winterton , the chief whip , for denouncing livingstone as a lying racist '' and a nazi apologist '' on tv .", 
                "( see 3.55pm . )", 
                "labour announced that mann would have to meet the chief whip at the same time it announced livingstone 's suspension .", 
                "he was called in because he confronted livingstone as livingstone arrived at bbc millbank for an interview .", 
                "here is a summary of what he said : you 're a disgusting racist , mr livingstone rewriting history you 're a lying racist , a nazi apologist you 're a disgusting nazi apologist go back and check what hitler did .", 
                "there 's a book called mein kampf .", 
                "you obviously have n't heard of it dachau concentration camp in his 50 days .", 
                "the race purity laws in his first 100 days .", 
                "at the time livingstone had a mobile phone held to his ear and did not respond properly because he was involved in a live interview with lbc .", 
                "subsequently livingstone found himself at the centre of a media scrum , and at one point he had to seek refuge in a disabled toilet .", 
                "it has been claimed that corbyn 's allies wanted mann to be suspended as well as livingstone , but that winterton blocked this .", 
                "if so , this would be further evidence that today has illustrated the comparative weakness of corbyn 's standing in the parliamentary party .", 
                "sadiq khan , labour 's candidate for london mayor , has joined those in the party denouncing livingstone .", 
                "his intervention suggests party candidates up for election next week may be worried about the damage this affair will do to their chances .", 
                "on the pm programme earlier robert shrimsley , managing editor of ft.com , said that the antisemitism row had persuaded him to change his voting plans in london .", 
                "he was going to vote for khan on the grounds he was the best candidate , shrimsley said .", 
                "but he said that he has now decided , as a jew , that he could not vote labour .", 
                "shrimsley repeated an argument he used in his ft column ( subscription ) .", 
                "[ khan ] is the favourite to be the next mayor of london ; he has run the better campaign for the post and is probably the best candidate .", 
                "by last weekend , i had concluded that he deserved my vote .", 
                "today , however , i know that he can not have it because right now it is simply impossible to see how jews can vote for a labour party that does not appear to like them labour has a problem with anti-semitism and a leader who does not seem to care enough about it .", 
                "until now my religious background has never been a factor in how i voted .", 
                "but mr corbyn has turned me into a political jew '' .", 
                "i , like many british jews , now feel as i imagine the gay community must have done when margaret thatcher passed the homophobic section 28 that 's all from me for today .", 
                "i 'm sorry all the other politics got ignored today .", 
                "this story just never stopped ."
