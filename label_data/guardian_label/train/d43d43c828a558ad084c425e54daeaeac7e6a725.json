                "good morning blogans , bloganistas , and welcome to tuesday in canberra , which is going off like a frog in a sock , to borrow an observation from the deputy prime minister barnaby joyce .", 
                "deputy prime minister and minister for agriculture barnaby joyce at a press conference in parliament house , canberra , monday 18th april 2016 .", 
                "bowers for the guardian on the first day of australia 's unofficial election campaign , the government has deployed joyce on the wireless to declare the coming election will see a choice between a nation run by someone who has made a quid in their life , made a success of their life , or a nation run by bill shorten .", 
                "joyce has predicted voters will reject what he 's characterised as a class one clown act the previous labor green independent alliance .", 
                "( independent deployed here for extra emphasis , joyce is squaring off in his northern new south wales electorate against tony windsor who was in the last parliament , and helped delivered class one clown act initiatives like needs based school funding and carbon pricing and a national disability scheme . )", 
                "inevitably , the deputy prime minister was also asked about the video that broke the internet yesterday : the video recorded by hollywood actor johnny depp and wife amber heard , confessing to their customs crimes and flogging the virtues of australia 's biosecurity regime .", 
                "many observers have noted the pair looked like participants in a hostage video .", 
                "joyce thinks hollywood classic .", 
                "he 's noted depp looked like he was auditioning for the godfather .", 
                "depending on your perspective , that 's possibly a downside .", 
                "the upside is the video is the best bit of viral advertising the department of agriculture has ever produced .", 
                "barnaby joyce we have a message going off like a frog in a sock .", 
                "that we do .", 
                "now to the other things going off .", 
                "folks with me yesterday , or in proximity to a television , or a radio , or the interwebz , or the dead tree edition of the interwebz , will of course know the government has now secured a trigger for a double dissolution election .", 
                "that means we will likely head to the polls shortly after the budget on 3 may , with the likely date 2 july 2 although on sky news this morning , the foreign minister , julie bishop , was suggesting options on election timing were still open .", 
                "parliament is sitting today with a thin legislative agenda .", 
                "there are various reports around ( including from my new colleague , gareth hutchens , who has joined guardian australia this week , welcome gareth ! )", 
                "suggesting the government could ( as soon as today ) restore hundreds of millions of dollars in funding cuts to the financial regulator , asic , in the abbott government 's first budget , while boosting the regulator 's intervention powers in an effort to neutralise labor 's politically popular call for a royal commission into the banking industry .", 
                "there are several other stories crackling away in the news cycle which i 'll come to shortly .", 
                "but let 's opening proceedings for you guys first .",
