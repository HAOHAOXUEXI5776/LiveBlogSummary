                "alan johnson , the former cabinet minister and chair of labour in for britain , has delivered a speech at the airbus factory in bristol .", 
                "here are the main points .", 
                "johnson claimed that two thirds of manufacturing jobs were dependent on demand from europe .", 
                "we are a trading and exporting nation and this great european market buys half of britain 's exports.eight out of ten of our top export markets are in the eu .", 
                "that 's why our manufacturing sector needs britain to be playing a leading role in the european union .", 
                "just yesterday the engineering employers federation announced that 82 per cent of their members see no sense in the uk cutting itself off from its major market two thirds of british jobs in manufacturing are dependent on demand from europe .", 
                "that 's two thirds of our manufacturing base reliant on that single market access and britain 's membership of the eu .", 
                "that 's over one and half million manufacturing jobs here in britain .", 
                "if we 're serious about gradually re-focusing our economy more towards making things , upon which there is cross party consensus we need to remain in europe .", 
                "turning specifically to apprentices in the manufacturing sector , and i 'm pleased to see some of you here today , around 50,000 apprentices depend on trade linked to our eu membership .", 
                "he said that workers could lose rights if britain left the eu .", 
                "when labour took office in 1997 , we opted into something called the social chapter , which gave working people decent basic minimum standards , like rights to four weeks paid leave , rights for part-time workers to get the same hourly rate as full-time agency workers to be treated fairly , paid maternity and paternity leave , anti-discrimination laws , and protections when companies change ownership .", 
                "there are those who want britain to leave europe because they want to destroy those rights .", 
                "they deride them as red tape '' .", 
                "they have the fundamentally unpatriotic ambition of turning britain into an off shore , anything goes , race to the bottom kind of country where workers have few rights and little protection .", 
                "he said that labour had today registered with the electoral commission to take part in the referendum .",

                "nick sutton ( @ suttonnick ) tuesday 's daily mail front page : now cameron turns nasty # tomorrowspaperstoday # bbcpapers # euref it is also interesting to see hague using the argument that , although the conservative party is divided , at least that makes them representative of the country on this issue .",

                "there 's a big budget coming up and conservatives all need to get behind it .",

                "i know from experience that this can be difficult when you momentarily want to throttle your colleagues - and since i do judo i really could have throttled them - but the armoury of a successful politician includes iron self-control .", 
                "third , it should be quietly understood that there will continue to be a place in the cabinet for ministers on both sides of this argument , but not for those who stooped to personal attacks or stoked a feud .", 
                "so even if the result is to stay in the eu , the talented minister who argued eloquently for leaving should know he or she will have a good job in the cabinet ; the minister who criticised their colleagues should know their future role is being the new special representative to warlords in the khyber pass .", 
                "fourth , conservatives ought to remember , and occasionally point out , that at least their party does represent the national dilemma and debate on eu membership .",
