                "the labour party 's campaigning against ukip '' document ( pdf ) is well worth a read .", 
                "although it is capable of being caricatured as containing a do n't mention immigration '' message , it is actually much more intelligent and sophisticated than that and it shows that ( at last ? )", 
                "labour has actually developed a plausible strategy to counter ukip .", 
                "it is a practical guide designed to help people engaged in door-to-door campaigning in areas where ukip is a threat .", 
                "here are some of the key points .", 
                "it says that ukip supporters are n't all the same and that labour campaigners need to differentiate between those ukip supporters who might back labour and those who have no chance of doing so .", 
                "as former conservative supporters are estimated to make up almost half of ukip supporters , this makes it clear regarding ukip supporters as a homogeneous group is a mistake .", 
                "for that reason , it is important to carefully target sub-groups within ukip 's base of support , as many ukip-leaning electors report they have little ( or no ) chance of ever considering voting labour .", 
                "we should therefore use the limited time before the general election to concentrate our efforts and resources on the electors we are most likely to be able to persuade to vote labour .", 
                "polling for comres in october 20143 suggested that , while 16 % of self-identified labour supporters would consider voting for ukip in the 2015 general election , 1 in 10 current ukip supporters would consider voting for the labour party .", 
                "this highlights that there are votes that can be won ( and lost ) in the fight against ukip .", 
                "our goal is to identify and target these electors with our key persuasion messages to win their support .", 
                "the biggest single group of ukip supporters , former tories , are likely to be attracted to ukip due their anti-eu rhetoric and right-wing policies which overlap with the conservative party 's right-wing policy agenda .", 
                "as such , these electors are unlikely to be easily won over by the labour party in the 2015 general election .", 
                "it says that labour campaigners should try to raise the salience of issues other than immigration , where labour policies are more popular .", 
                "as a political party , we are more effective at changing what is discussed and debated ( the salience of the issues ) , as opposed to changing what may be long-held and entrenched opinions of each party or views on which party has the best policies on each issue .", 
                "for example , in autumn 2013 we saw a sharp rise in the salience of energy prices in the wake of ed 's policy announcement at annual conference and the integrated campaigns we ran in the weeks and months that followed .", 
                "more recently , we have seen a substantial increase in the salience of the nhs .", 
                "following from this , when we embark on policy messaging around immigration , which is not an area where labour has the strongest lead over other parties , we should ensure that this messaging is always done in conjunction with other policy areas .", 
                "the purpose of this is to raise the salience of those issues in which labour has a much clearer lead and stands to benefit more from their prominence with the electorate .", 
                "this is especially true when messaging comes from the local candidate and local party , where the magnitude of this effect may be greatest .", 
                "it says voters often link immigration with issues on which labour is stronger .", 
                "the labour party has commissioned polling by greenberg quinlan rosner research ( gqrr ) to test the top issues among different groups of electors .", 
                "table 4 shows that older traditionalists , who are more likely to vote for ukip , are also most likely to select immigration as one of the two most important issues for them .", 
                "this concern for immigration is often framed around other issues ( such as local housing , healthcare or other services ) where the labour party tends to be rated more highly .", 
                "this is closely followed by the nhs , which is also considered a key issue for the majority of older traditionalist electors .", 
                "it says that campaigners should listen to voters concerns about immigration , but also move the conversation on to other issues .", 
                "while it is clear that ukip 's campaign is largely concentrated on the issue of immigration , we can not and should not fight the ukip threat simply on their terms , not least because we will not win a bidding war on the issue .", 
                "although immigration is an important issue for many electors , and is often mentioned on the doorstep , it is often used as a means to express other concerns .", 
                "many of these issues , including healthcare , housing , and the delivery of other local services , are among the strongest policy areas for the labour party .", 
                "volunteers and activists must understand and acknowledge electors ' concerns about immigration on the doorstep , which will mean hearing opinions that may not gel with their own .", 
                "in these cases , it 's important to remember that first phase of re-establishing trust is to listen and understand .", 
                "keep in mind too that there may well be some voters who , with the best will in the world , we are unlikely to bring back from ukip .", 
                "it 's nonetheless essential that we leave them with a positive impression of the labour party , to avoid cementing them in their views and thus their voting patterns .", 
                "our focus must instead be moving the conversation on to issues where we have clear policy which tackles the problems people are worried about , whether they express those concerns through the prism of immigration or not .", 
                "in summary , campaigners should acknowledge concerns and contextualise the problem as something that labour has a clear plan to improve .", 
                "it says raising immigration with voters pro-actively can be counter-productive .", 
                "immigration is a complex issue , on which the labour party has a series of policies designed to address legitimate concerns .", 
                "once explained and the context surrounding the issue made clear , our policies tend to be accepted as common sense .", 
                "however , writing to electors proactively ( i.e .", 
                ": without evidence the elector is concerned about it ) about immigration risks undermining the broad coalition of support we need to return to government , for the following reasons : as a general rule , a higher salience for the issue does not translate into electoral advantage for us ; and we do not have much data collected in many ukip target areas .", 
                "even with the best models we can develop , this means we will inevitably be hitting some people for whom it is unhelpful to raise the salience of immigration as an issue .", 
                "but it says that labour campaigners should face the issue of immigration directly '' with ukip supporters .", 
                "our advice [ when dealing with people planning to vote ukip ] is therefore we should : ( a ) listen carefully to electors ' concerns on immigration on the doorstep and engage with their views before moving the conversation on to how labour would tackle the issues they have raised ( whether they be housing , education , the nhs , etc . ) .", 
                "we should acknowledge electors ' concerns and contextualise the problem as something that labour has a clear plan to improve ; ( b ) focus our messaging on our key policies that will have improve the lives of electors ; and ( c ) face the issue of immigration directly with identified ukip supporters .", 
                "with electors who have already indicated that they intend to vote for ukip , we should set out our immigration policy clearly and explain how it resolves the issues people raise while forming part of our wider package of changes to how britain works to make britain fairer and more prosperous for everyone .", 
                "it uses the mosaic system - a form of classifying people according to social type , which is more detailed than conventional class analysis - to explain who is mostly likely to vote ukip .", 
                "our current understanding suggests that ukip 's support is strongest among the following mosaic groups : l - elderly needs '' ( 26 % ) elderly people who are reliant on support either through specialised accommodation or the basic state pensio e - active retirement '' ( 22 % ) elders who have sufficient pensions and savings to choose pleasant locations in which to enjoy their retirement m - industrial heritage '' ( 20 % ) families and couples owning affordable older style housing in communities historically dependent on manufacturing d - small town diversity '' ( 19 % ) residents of small and medium-sized towns who have strong roots in their local community mosaic groups and it identifies which mosaic groups are most likely to be ukip-labour switchers .", 
                "however , it is not enough to merely identify those mosaic groups where ukip support is most widespread because many ukip supporters have little or no chance of ever voting labour .", 
                "instead , we should target electors who share similar characteristics to ukip supporters , but fall into our categorisation of ukip-labour switchers based on our polling data .", 
                "this group is defined as a ) voted labour in 2010 and intend to vote ukip now ; b ) intend to vote ukip now but state that they have a good chance of voting labour , and a fair or no chance of voting tory ; c ) intend to vote ukip now but state that they have a fair chance of voting labour , and no chance of voting tory ; or d ) intend to vote labour but report a good chance of voting ukip .", 
                "as figure 6 shows , the biggest group of such electors is within mosaic group j , followed by mosaic groups i and l. mosaic group j is claimant cultures - families reliant on benefits in low-rise council housing where there is widespread disadvantage '' .", 
                "mosaic group i is ex council communities - residents with low levels of education but sufficent incomes who live in the better right-to-buy council houses . ''", 
                "and mosaic group l is elderly needs - elderly people who are reliant on support either through specialised accommodation or the basic state pension .", 
                "it says that strong campaigning on the ground can beat ukip .", 
                "lessons can be learnt from the european election campaign .", 
                "in particular , strong campaigning on the ground can help to win back and secure the support of disaffected electors who may be sympathetic to ukip 's positioning as a party of protest and discontent .", 
                "past labour party campaigns against protest parties ( including against the bnp in barking and against the liberal democrats in constituencies ranging from chesterfield to islington south ) have shown that work on the doorstep , combining clear messaging and targeting within constituencies will help to combat this threat on the ground .", 
                "it says door-to-door campaign makes a difference generally .", 
                "pattie and johnston sum up the research on campaign effects in the uk bluntly : other things being equal , the more parties campaign locally , the more votes they gain and the fewer votes go to their rivals '' of the relatively few studies that have attempted to quantify the effect of local campaigns , a change in intensity of the labour party 's local campaign from no campaigning to the average 'campaign intensity ' was associated with an increase in our vote share of more than 5 percentage points , even when taking other local political factors in account .", 
                "of particular relevance to this election , there is evidence that the benefits gained from campaigning are even larger for opposition parties than they are for incumbents .",
