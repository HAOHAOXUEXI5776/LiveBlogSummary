                "more than 50 former military officials , national security figures and government officials have published a letter calling on republican presidential nominee donald trump to detail his overseas business investments ahead of the us presidential election , another consequence of the nominee 's tacit refusal to release any tax information relating to his vast and murky business empire .", 
                "donald trump .", 
                "vucci/ap trump still has not revealed to the american public his international business relationships , even as it becomes increasingly clear that his overseas ties could well constitute significant conflicts of interest when it comes to charting us foreign policy , the letter reads .", 
                "this is unprecedented for a candidate for the nation 's highest office .", 
                "as such , we are calling on mr. trump to disclose , in full , the nature of his business relationships overseas - to include specifically who his business partners are and what and where are his foreign investments .", 
                "we also call on him to pledge that he will divest himself of his overseas business interests should he win the presidency .", 
                "the letter was penned in response to a newsweek investigation into trump 's international business dealings , which put trump in a position to personally and financially benefit from some of the positions his campaign has taken .", 
                "for instance , his stance that south korea should be able to develop a nuclear weapons program would benefit the daewoo group , with which the trump organization has longstanding ties .", 
                "the letter did not mince words in criticizing trump 's alleged links to shady international organizations and persons : trump 's other business partners have included kremlin-tied oligarchs and russians with mafia links , an individual accused of money laundering for the iranian military , a turkish media tycoon accused of running a fuel-smuggling ring , indian companies that may have violated india 's laws in their pursuit of business with mr. trump , and a south korean company mired in scandal .", 
                "it 's not hard to see why these reported relationships would be problematic , the letter 's authors state .", 
                "the issues are too important to leave them unanswered .", 
                "it would be in trump 's own interest to resolve these potential conflicts before the election ."
