                "good morning politics tragics , and welcome to the final day of this parliamentary sitting week .", 
                "now riddle me this : does the abbott cabinet not run and articulate security policy any more ?", 
                "i ask the question because this morning we read the chairman of parliament 's joint intelligence and security committee , dan tehan , thinks we should be bombing islamic state targets in syria .", 
                "the member for wannon , dan tehan .", 
                "bowers for the guardian dan tehan , in a column in the herald sun .", 
                "the time has come for australia to join the military coalition seeking to destroy daesh [ isis ] in syria .", 
                "we are acting in iraq against daesh , with our hornets launching air strikes on a regular basis .", 
                "we should be doing the same in syria .", 
                "tehan is a good bloke , and he 's entirely within his rights to express an opinion on this score given he runs the security committee and takes a very close interest in these issues .", 
                "however , there is some history here .", 
                "when the prime minister ran into cabinet-level trouble a couple of months back on its citizenship revocation proposal ( pests like malcolm turnbull and christopher pyne and barnaby joyce thought it might be good if the law was constitutional ) tehan and other backbenchers on the security committee materialised publicly to make abbott 's case for him .", 
                "in fact this bunch wanted the government to go further on citizenship : strip citizenship from people who were sole citizens .", 
                "so i 'm looking at tehan 's contribution this morning with the sum of that recent history in mind .", 
                "perhaps there has already been a discussion within the government and tehan merely has been deputised to reflect the government 's new view ( as opposed , for some reason , to the defence minister or the prime minister ) .", 
                "or perhaps this is a bit of authorised boundary riding in order to test the current bipartisanship around the iraq commitment .", 
                "labor supports military action in iraq , but the opposition thus far has drawn the line at crossing the border into syria .", 
                "ah yes , here is tanya plibersek now at the doors of parliament , talking to reporters .", 
                "has the government 's policy on the deployment to the middle east changed , she wonders , and if so , would the government be so kind as to offer a briefing ?", 
                "there are serious questions about the legality of incursions into syria .", 
                "what , exactly , is going on here ?", 
                "tehan 's intervention is no small or academic thing given the delicacy of political support for the current deployment , and i note there 's another story in the hun 's sister paper , the telegraph , this morning indicating the united states has asked for australia 's help in the conflict .", 
                "all this foregrounding is about as subtle as a meat axe and we all know how much the prime minister desires a point of difference between the government and labor on a security issue .", 
                "we 've seen that dynamic play out in bursts of pure politics ( never mind coherence or fairness or technicalities or the long game ) for the best part of 12 months .", 
                "the only question in my mind is : why is the backbench leading the charge ?", 
                "anyway we 'll pursue the threads of this story through the course of the day .", 
                "loads of other issues still burbling in the building .", 
                "i 'll address where we are with same-sex marriage this morning in the next post .", 
                "let 's open the conversation for today .", 
                "the thread is waiting for your business .", 
                "you can also reach mikearoo and me on the twits @ twitterid and @ twitterid grab your flat whites .", 
                "here comes thursday ."
