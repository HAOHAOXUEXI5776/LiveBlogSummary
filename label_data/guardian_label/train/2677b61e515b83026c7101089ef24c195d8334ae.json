                "if the current downward pressure on prices remains , there is a risk that conversion of deflationary mindset , which has so far been progressing steadily , will be delayed .", 
                "today 's action is a real surprise , sending shares soaring on the japanese stock market and weakening the yen .", 
                "and the boj was split over the decision - voting 5-4 in favour : matt o'brien ( @ obsoletedogma ) impressed that kuroda is willing to push through more easing with just a 5-4 majority .", 
                "that 's how you do it .",
