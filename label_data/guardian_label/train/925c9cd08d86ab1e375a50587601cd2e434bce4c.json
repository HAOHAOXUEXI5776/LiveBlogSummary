                "a few minutes later johnson used a question to accuse cameron of not doing enough to assert the sovereignty of parliament .",

                "cameron replied : this deal brings back some welfare powers , it brings back some immigration powers , it brings back some bailout powers , but more than that , because it carves us forever out of ever closer union , it means that the ratchet of the european court taking power away from this country can not happen in future .",

                "there has been some speculation that having boris johnson backing the vote leave campaign ( as he did yesterday , although he claimed he could not remember its name ) will increase it chances of being designated the official out campaign by the electoral commission .", 
                "there are two organisations seeking the out designation : vote leave , which is westminster-focused and tory-dominated , and grassroots out ( go ) , which is grassroots-focused and arguably more cross-party , but also strongly ukip-backed .", 
                "on the in side there is only one main organisation , britain stronger in europe , which seems certain to get lead campaign status .", 
                "when the electoral commission does designate , the two lead groups on each side will get a grant worth up to \u00a3 600,000 , campaign broadcasts and free mailing .", 
                "they will also be allowed to spend up to \u00a3 7m , instead of \u00a3 700,000 , the limit that applies to other registered campaign groups .", 
                "so the outcome of the vote leave/go designation battle is actually very significant .", 
                "and johnson 's decision to support vote leave may not make much difference .", 
                "a former electoral commissioner insider ( who does not want to be identified because of his current job ) has written to me this morning to say that journalists do n't all fully understand how the designation process works .", 
                "he says : the ec 's guidance on designation says that where there 's more than one campaign that adequately '' represents those campaigning for a referendum outcome , it has to designate the campaign that represents those campaigning for the outcome to the greatest extent '' .", 
                "that test is in the legislation ( political parties , elections and referendums act 2000 ) so the ec does n't have any discretion to over-ride it - and if it tried , it would be judicially reviewed and lose .", 
                "( this in turn would probably lead to the referendum being postponed , because it would have to re-take the designation decision and there would n't be time for the winner to use the free mailing etc before 23 june ) .", 
                "so the ec will have to look very carefully at what the campaigns can show about how broad a church they are .", 
                "the weekend means vote leave have some heavier hitters than before , but they 're all essentially from the same place - the relatively non-loony end of the conservatives ( plus the ukip mp douglas carswell ) .", 
                "and although the go rally looked ludicrous , it underlined that they have a broader base of support from high-profile politicians at the moment ( albeit all eccentrics ) .", 
                "as well as galloway and ukip they have kate hoey and the old-style tory eurosceptics .", 
                "the thing that 's probably really worrying vote leave is that they 've lost hoey and co. at the moment their main labour '' affiliate seems to be john mills , who 's a donor not a politician .", 
                "[ vote leave chief executive ] matthew elliott 's strategy for getting the designation would have relied heavily on having labour leave '' signed up to vote leave , but at the moment the labour campaign it seems to be in limbo , which is a major problem for him .", 
                "he 's also lost jenny jones from the greens and ruth lea from the amusingly-named economists for britain , both more minor losses but still symptoms of things going wrong somewhere .",
