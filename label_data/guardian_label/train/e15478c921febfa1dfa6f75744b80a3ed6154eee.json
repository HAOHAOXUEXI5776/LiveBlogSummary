                "if the swing is big enough , then it 's possible malcolm turnbull could emerge on the other side of the election not with the mandate he wants , but in a more parlous position , not only because various people have lost their jobs so he 's lost specific numbers in his own column , but because the coalition will find a near-death experience unsettling .",
