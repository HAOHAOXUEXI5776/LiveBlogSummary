                "he made the comment in a speech in which he also claimed that some of those campaigning for britain to leave the eu thought job losses and economic disruption were a price worth paying .",

                "the west 's leading economic thinktank has provided backing for david cameron 's pro-eu stance by warning that a uk vote to leave the union would cause lasting damage and would harm the rest of the world .", 
                "as larry elliott reports , catherine mann , the chief economist at the organisation for economic co-operation and development , said a no vote would be bad for the uk , bad for europe and bad for the global economy '' .speaking in london on thursday , mann said she was not convinced by the argument made by boris johnson , the mayor of london , that the long-term benefits of departure would outweigh short-term costs .", 
                "stephen kinnock , the labour mp and son of the former leader neil kinnock , has said that labour needs a big jump forward '' in the english council elections for jeremy corbyn to be sure of staying on as leader .", 
                "in an interview with the huffington post common people podcast , he said the may elections would go a long way towards showing whether corbyn was a potential prime minister .", 
                "he said : the big question is when people look at him do they see somebody who could be the next prime minister of the united kingdom and i think we will know a large part of the answer to that question following the elections on may 5 and also how the labour party carries itself now through to the 23rd june and the referendum .", 
                "jeremy , as any leader , gets judged on performance , gets judged on results , so until we see what those results are opinion polls - as we saw with the 2015 election - they are not worth the paper they 're written on .", 
                "asked what a successful result for labour would be , kinnock replied : we need a labour mayor in london .", 
                "we need a big jump forward in the council elections in england , we need in wales to hold on well to government .", 
                "i think scotland - very , very problematic - but we need as an absolute minimum to be coming in as a second party in scotland .", 
                "and asked whether failure to achieve those successes would raise questions about corbyn 's leadership , he replied : absolutely , i think any leader of any political party is judged by their results and we need to set ambitious , challenging targets for what we want to achieve in may .", 
                "if we 're not reaching those targets then of course questions need to be asked .", 
                "corbyn 's supporters may be alarmed by the benchmarks kinnock is setting because one academic analysis earlier this year said labour was on course to lose seats in the council elections , and polls suggest labour will lose its majority in the welsh assembly .", 
                "sun editor tony gallagher has said he may still print more details about the queen 's stance on europe , and has accused people close to nick clegg '' of trying to implicate brexit supporter michael gove in leaking the story .",
