                "[ as explained earlier , the fund says it should n't be blamed for asking if the targets agreed between greece and the rest of europe are credible ] tsakalotos 's comments come as monitors arrive in athens for fresh talks about the country 's bailout programme .", 
                "from athens , helena smith reports : greece is being boxed into a corner and the international monetary fund is economizing with the truth when it says it is not asking for more austerity but rather is the victim of greece 's bizarre predilection to agree '' to higher primary fiscal targets of 3.5 % of gdp .", 
                "that is the verdict of euclid tsakalotos , the greek finance minister who in exclusive comments to the guardian this morning responded witheringly to the washington-based body 's assertion that athens will need to make yet more pension and tax cuts after its bailout programme expires in mid-2018 - a demand that no government , after seven years of relentless recession , could accept or survive .", 
                "the oxford philosopher j l austen was particularly critical of forms of argument that relied on the following technique : there 's the bit where you say it , and then there 's the bit where you take it back .", 
                "the imf is particularly open to this criticism , '' tsakalotos told me .", 
                "in effect it is arguing for greek pensioners and poorer wage earners to make further economies , while it economizes on the truth . ''", 
                "the oxford-educated economist , who was raised in britain , said in its obsession to make the numbers add up the imf was now advocating policies that would increase inequality and social exclusion - contradicting its own self-avowed goal of emphasising the importance of inclusive growth .", 
                "in their blog overnight , the fund 's europe director poul thomsen and chief economic counsellor maurice obstfeld argued that : greece can not modernize its economy by boosting funding for infrastructure and well-targeted social programs while exempting more than half of households from income taxes and paying public pensions at the level of the richest european countries . ''", 
                "tsakalotos disputes this claim , arguing that : greek expenditure on both pensions and other subsidies is about 70 % of the eu average and 52 % of that of germany .", 
                "is it likely when around 45 % of pensioners receive monthly payments below the poverty line of \u20ac665 , and almost four million people , that is more than a third of the population , have been classed as being at risk of poverty or social exclusion , that greece 's main problem is that pensions and tax credit allowances are too generous ?", 
                "at the same time , the only reason why more people are exempt from paying income tax is that fewer people have decent incomes .", 
                "so the imf that is supposedly rethinking the relationship between development and inequality , and is rightly emphasizing the importance of inclusive growth , seems to be unaware that further reducing pensions and the tax credit allowance can not but fail to increase both inequality and social exclusion .", 
                "but at least then the numbers will add up . ''", 
                "the greek finance minister emphatically denied that athens had agreed with the demand of its euro zone partners to pursue a primary surplus of 3.5 % of gdp in the post-programme period .",

                "i laid out the position of the greek government that high primary surpluses for an economy like greece and what it has gone through during the crisis make no economic or political sense , '' he insisted .", 
                "some member states were supporting the position that the 3.5 % figure should be preserved for ten years ; others were working towards a compromise of five years .", 
                "the greek position was that neither would work for greece and we suggested the compromise of going down immediately to 2.5 % , but agreeing with the institutions that the one percentage point reduction from 3.5 % should be spent entirely on reducing taxes on small and medium sized enterprises , thus enhancing competitiveness and growth .", 
                "what was the imf response ?", 
                "the imf argued within the eurogroup that : it does n't matter to us whether it is three , five or ten years of high surpluses , we will still need to see more measures to make the numbers add up since we do n't think that 3.5 % is achievable without such measures '' .", 
                "it did not bother to address our compromise suggestion .",
