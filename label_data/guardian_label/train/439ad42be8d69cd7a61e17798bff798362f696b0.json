                "and right now , bitcoin futures contracts which settle in 2018 have all fallen below their opening value .", 
                "the january 2018 contract , which initially spiked over $ 20,000 , has now dropped back to $ 18,920 - having been originally priced at $ 19,500 .",

                "the spot price of bitcoin has also dipped , currently down 1.6 % at $ 18,640 - having hit a new alltime high near $ 20,000 last night .",

                "a senior singaporean regulator said bitcoin had no intrinsic value france 's finance minister is pushing for the g20 to debate bitcoin regulation ubs 's chairmen , axel weber , said regulators should take a closer look at digital currencies analysts at ing also put the boot into bitcoin , saying it would eventually become just a \u0080\u0098niche product ' again .",

                "but as we have argued above , we doubt whether bitcoin itself has what it takes to become a serious mainstream payment systems contender .", 
                "instead , we think it is more likely for bitcoin to return to its roots as a niche payment system .",
