                "for a start while mr macron is an outsider from the established political order , he will still be viewed by the majority of the 40 % of french people who voted for anti-euro candidates , as very much part of the same elite who he has helped to push to one side in this particular vote , which means he will be presiding over a country very much ill at ease with itself ."
