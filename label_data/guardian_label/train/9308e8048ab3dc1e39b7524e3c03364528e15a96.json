                "gordon brown , the labour former prime minister , has accused david cameron of effectively betraying the scots over the independence referendum by concealing his plans to downgrade the status of scottish mps until after voting was over .", 
                "he made the claim in a speech in the devolution debate in which he also warned that conservative plans for english votes for english laws '' ( evel ) , combined with the party 's plan to give scotland full control over income tax , could lead to the break up of the uk .", 
                "( see 4.22pm . )", 
                "william hague , the conservative leader of the commons , has confirmed that he wants to give mps the chance to vote on evel before the end of november .",

                "john redwood , a conservative , said he thought there was a chance the conservatives could win such a vote .",

                "david cameron has said that labour 's decision to boycott the cabinet committee looking at evel shows labour are are not interested in fairness across the united kingdom '' .",

                "hague has said the government would consider the case for a constitutional convention on the west lothian question .", 
                "but he made it clear this would not stop the conservatives pushing their vote on evel soon .", 
                "labour is opposed to evel and its main response to the issue is to propose a constitutional convention , meeting in 2015 , to allow time for regions to draw up their own ideas .", 
                "at deputy prime minister 's questions nick clegg said he also favoured a constitutional convention .", 
                "in the debate hague said : there will be a place and a time for a constitutional convention but not one that is a device to prevent issues being addressed now .", 
                "the conservatives have decided to hold the rochester and strood byelection on thursday 20 november .", 
                "david blunkett , the former home secretary , has called for stronger oversight of the uk 's intelligence agencies and warned that the old-fashioned paternalism '' of secrecy based on perceived security interests was undermining public confidence in their activities .", 
                "cameron has criticised france 's obsession '' with a 35-hour working week .", 
                "he said : very dangerous to ever point a finger at another european country but i sometimes think the french , with their obsession with the 35-hour working week , they are falling into the danger of a lump of labour fallacy , where 'if only everyone just worked 35 hours there would be more work to go round ' .", 
                "i think what you have seen is that results in higher unemployment , less competitive industry , fewer people wanting to invest in your economy .", 
                "that 's why the rates of unemployment in france and in britain are so different .", 
                "ours is way , way below theirs .",

                "i think you should be able to pass a family home on to your children rather than leave it to the taxman i would like to see that go further because i think even at \u00a3 650,00 , particularly in some parts of the country , you see someone who has worked hard , they have put money into their house , they have done it up to improve it and they want to leave it to their children and they do n't feel that they are in any way the mega-rich , and they feel 'i should be able to do that without having 40 % of it knocked off ' .",

                "this , combined with english votes for english laws '' , would break up the union , he said .", 
                "as for the west lothian question , he did not have a particularly good solution himself , but he said the mckay commission offered a possible answer .", 
                "brown accused david cameron of effectively betraying the scottish people , because he refused to tell them before the referendum of plans that would devolve the status of scottish mps ( ie , his plan for english votes for english laws '' ) .", 
                "without telling people beforehand a matter that was absolutely material to the vote that people was casting on the scottish referendum , a new plan was imposed upon scotland .", 
                "it was a vow that had been written on the tuesday , that was now being rewritten on the friday morning .", 
                "because while the proposed change was , [ cameron ] said , in the english constitution , the actual practical effect of it was , in scottish constitutional affairs , to restrict the voting rights of scottish members of parliament on an issue as fundamental as taxation .", 
                "clearly that was a change in scotland 's status in the united kingdom .", 
                "clearly it was highly material to the vote that people had just had .", 
                "and should not the people of scotland have been told prior to the referendum , which was on scotland 's status in the united kingdom , that the downgrading of scottish representation in westminster was one of the proposals that he now [ advocated ] .", 
                "he said downgrading the status of scottish mp , and giving scotland 100 % control over scottish income tax ( as the conservatives propose ) would be lethal '' to the union .", 
                "what makes for a lethal cocktail on this is that the conservative party wants to devolve 100 % of income tax to the scottish parliament and then immediately end the right of scottish members of parliament to vote on income tax on a matter as substantial as the budget there is no state in the world , federal or otherwise , that devolves all of income tax from the national exchequer to regional , local or national assemblies .", 
                "and there is not a parliament in the world that would impose a national income tax on only some of the country , but not all of the country .", 
                "and there are very good reasons why it is the combination of the two proposals , to devolve 100 % of income tax and then to remove the right of scottish mps to vote on the matters in westminster , that is absolutely lethal to the constitution .",

                "and let us remember the words of the new testament , quoted by lincoln , a house divided can not stand '' and a house divided is brought into desolation '' .", 
                "and i believe that is the truth of what the conservative party is now doing .", 
                "and soon this diminished status for scotland would have to apply to wales .",
