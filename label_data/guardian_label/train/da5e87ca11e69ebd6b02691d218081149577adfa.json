                "it was a job done '' interview for ed miliband .", 
                "he was not outstanding or surprising , and he sounded mildly rant-y at one point towards the beginning , as he was going on about living standards , but overall he was fine , and he certainly punched out enough news lines .", 
                "here are the key points .", 
                "it 's a beefed-up version of the summary i filed earlier , with quotes .", 
                "ed miliband said that , if david cameron refused to take part in the proposed televised leaders ' debate , the broadcasters should empty chair '' him , and go ahead without him .", 
                "no leader should be allowed a veto , he said .", 
                "i think it is pretty disreputable that david cameron went into the 2010 election saying that these debates were the most important thing that we could possibly have and people should n't make feeble excuses to get out of them , and he is doing precisely that .", 
                "he is running scared of these debates .", 
                "i want these debates to happen , i think they should happen with david cameron or without david cameron .", 
                "in the end that 's a matter for the broadcasters , but i do n't think any one political leader should be able to stop these debates happen , should be able to veto these debates , block these debates .", 
                "if an empty chair represents david cameron in these debates , so be it .", 
                "i think these debates need to happen .", 
                "they are owned by the british people , not owned by david cameron or anybody else .",

                "pressed about this repeatedly , he said he could not recall exactly what he had said .",

                "press on this , he said he was not about deals '' .", 
                "but he also conceded that the phrase did not mean he was ruling them out .", 
                "he said he was open to the idea of reducing the benefits cap , the total an out-of-work household can receive in benefits , from \u00a3 26,000 .", 
                "he wanted a benefits cap that worked , and one option might be to vary it regionally , he said .", 
                "the conservatives want to cut it to \u00a3 23,000 .", 
                "he rejected the conservative plan to ban public sector strikes unless 40 % of members are in favour .", 
                "he said he would consider the case for giving the security services extra internet surveillance powers .", 
                "in a reference to the so-called snooper 's charter , backed by the tories but opposed by the lib dems , he struck an ambivalent note , saying that he would not rule out giving the security services more powers , but that oversight was important too .", 
                "we 've got to look at 'do our intelligence services have the tools they need ?",
