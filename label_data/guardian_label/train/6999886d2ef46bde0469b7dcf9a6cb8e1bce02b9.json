                "the last-minute decision to delay agreeing the new hinkley point nuclear power station ?", 
                "timothy set out the thinking behind that in a conservativehome column last october , the government is selling our national security to china .", 
                "and extending grammar schools ?", 
                "timothy proposed exactly that in an interview with the daily telegraph last november .", 
                "so what else in on timothy 's agenda ?", 
                "here are five policies that he is likely to be pushing , based on what he has said in the past .", 
                "1 - introducing tighter curbs on student visas .", 
                "( timothy wrote about that here . )", 
                "2 - making it easier for faith schools to expand .", 
                "in a conservativehome article timothy wrote : the government should abolish its admissions rule for faith-designated free schools - which requires a school , when it is oversubscribed , to limit the number of pupils it accepts on the basis of faith to fifty per cent - and replace it with a more effective approach .", 
                "the existing rule fails according to its own objective : it does little to increase the diversity of jewish , muslim , sikh and hindu schools , because for now at least they are unlikely to appeal to parents of other faiths .", 
                "but the rule is effectively discriminatory for roman catholics : it prevents them from opening new free schools because it is almost certainly against canon law for a catholic bishop to set up a school that turned away catholic pupils on the basis of their catholicism .", 
                "given that there is growing demand for roman catholic schools , which are more likely to be ethnically diverse than other schools , more likely to be in poor areas , more likely to be rated good or outstanding by ofsted , and more likely to provide what parents want , the rule should be replaced by a legal duty on faith schools to ensure that their pupils mix - perhaps through sport , performing arts , or school visits - with children of other backgrounds .", 
                "3 - making welfare more contributions-based .", 
                "in another article timothy said one problem with the conservative election defeat of 1906 was that it led to plans for contributions-based welfare backed by his hero joe chamberlain being shelved .", 
                "in 1906 , mps behaved as though their identities as free traders and tariff reformers were more important than as unionists , and the consequences of their defeat continue to be felt even now .", 
                "the lloyd george 'people 's budget ' of 1908 introduced a non-contributory pension system - unlike the contributions-based proposal made by chamberlain that was rejected by salisbury and balfour - and our welfare state to this day remains non-contributory ( a fact that is , coincidentally , relevant to the debate about eu nationals claiming benefits in britain ) .", 
                "as my colleague heather stewart has already reported , may 's new director of policy , john godfrey , is also interested in social insurance systems that create stronger links between what individuals pay and the welfare they get .", 
                "4 - more housebuilding .", 
                "in another conservativehome article timothy wrote : often - on aspects of welfare reform , the increase in the minimum wage , and the investment in the northern powerhouse and the ( excruciatingly badly-branded ) midlands engine - the government has got these calls right .", 
                "but when it comes to energy policy , house building , high immigration , cuts to tax credits , the protection of pensioner benefits , and the profile of spending cuts , it has not .", 
                "5 - a full inquiry into orgreave .", 
                "the home office is still considering calls for a full inquiry into orgreave , but timothy said in a conservativehome article he was in favour of a proper inquiry .", 
                "the economy needed to be reformed , the unions needed to be faced down , and unprofitable pits needed to be closed .", 
                "but if the police pre-planned a mass , unlawful assault on the miners at orgreave , and then sought to cover up what they did and arrest people on trumped-up charges , we need to know .", 
                "and here are two ideas that timothy strongly supports - but which may is much less likely to back because they would involve abandoning conservative party manifesto promises .", 
                "6 - getting rid of the triple lock '' that ensure state pensions rise every year in line with growth or inflation or by 2.5 % , whichever is higher .", 
                "7 - abandoning plans to lift the inheritance tax threshold to \u00a3 1m .", 
                "in one conservativehome article timothy wrote : [ the chancellor ] could redistribute the welfare cuts to take the pressure off low-paid , working people .", 
                "but the obvious alternative is already off the table : pensioner benefits are protected and so is the triple lock '' , which means that the state pension goes up by the highest out of the growth of wages , inflation or 2.5 per cent .", 
                "another option - to demonstrate that the government really does value hard work above all else - is to stop the inheritance tax cut for estates valued between \u00a3 650,000 and \u00a3 1 million .",

                "this makes it all the more surprising that jeremy corbyn chose not to raise the grammar school issue at pmqs yesterday .",
