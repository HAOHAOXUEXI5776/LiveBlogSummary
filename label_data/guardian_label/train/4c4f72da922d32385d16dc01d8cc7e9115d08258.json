                "hillary clinton appears to be widening her national lead over donald trump , according to an nbc news/surveymonkey tracking poll , which now has clinton up eight points , 49-41 , against trump .", 
                "last week she was up six points in the poll , which is in line with current averages .", 
                "clinton had a six-point lead on trump , 42-36 , when libertarian candidate gary johnson and green candidate jill stein were included in the nbc poll , which was conducted online from 20-26 june .", 
                "the head of election polling for surveymonkey points out that the biggest clinton gain in the poll was among the youth : mark blumenthal ( @ mysterypollster ) biggest clinton gain in this week 's nbc/ @ surveymonkey tracker : 18-24 year olds ( n=407 ) potentially alarming for trump , a 52 % majority of republicans told the pollster they would have preferred someone else as nominee .", 
                "clinton also scored quite poorly in this regard 45 % of democrats told the pollster they would have preferred someone else .", 
                "there 's more fresh polling news out there : an abc news/washington post poll found that clinton leads trump 50-39 in terms of trust to handle terrorism , and respondents thought clinton did a better job of responding to the orlando mass shooting of 12 june : this week ( @ thisweekabc ) abc/wapo poll : 46 % think clinton did better job than trump of responding to orlando shooting trump silent on the trail today , trump has a rally scheduled outside pittsburgh , pennsylvania , a state where he hopes to score a key upset in a redrawn electoral map .", 
                "trump has been uncharacteristically silent on social media in the past 24 hours ; he has not commented on the latest polling , for example .", 
                "neither has he commented on a major supreme court ruling monday striking down a restrictive anti-abortion law in texas .", 
                "communications help is on the way , however .",

                "before starting the gig , miller deleted mean things he said about trump on twitter , but other past statements were circulating : vaughn hillyard ( @ vaughnhillyard ) jason miller , trump 's new senior communications adviser , just 2.5 months ago on when trump `` freaks out '' : trump also wants to hire state directors this week , bloomberg reports ( why rush it ?", 
                ") : jennifer jacobs ( @ jenniferjjacobs ) big priority for trump camp this week : name state directors in more than a dozen key battleground states .",

                "democrats on the committee , which like congress at large is currently controlled by republicans , issued a separate dissenting report on monday .", 
                "leaked excerpts indicate the official committee report will find that us facilities at benghazi were not safe , that intelligence reports made that fact clear and that clinton , as secretary of state , failed to act .", 
                "trump denies reversal on muslim ban the trump campaign pushed back hard on monday on reports that the presumptive republican nominee was modifying his proposed ban on muslims entering the us .",
