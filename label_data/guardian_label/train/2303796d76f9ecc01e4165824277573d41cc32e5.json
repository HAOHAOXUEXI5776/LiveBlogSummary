                "michael fallon , the defence secretary , has refused to say whether jihadi brides '' count as innocent civilian when the government is planning using drone strikes to kill terrorists targets .", 
                "he was giving evidence to the joint committee on human rights about how the government approves targeted killings by drones , and he said the government did all it could to avoid civilian deaths .", 
                "but harriet harman , the chair , said the government was assuming that some people were in a grey area '' because they were not targets , but they were not considered innocent civilians either .", 
                "fallon did not dispute this , but he refused to say if a jihadi bride '' would count as someone in this category - ie , someone who might be deemed an acceptable casualty .", 
                "he told harman : i 'm sure you can see why it would be extremly dangerous for me to answer that question , to say exactly the circumstances in which we would strike a potential terrorist , and the circumstances in which we would not .", 
                "i 'm obviously not going to answer that question because that would simply enable our enemies to better protect themselves .", 
                "but i can assure you again we look at these things on a case by case basis , and we do everything possible to minimise civilian casualties , and the action taken must be proportionate .", 
                "after the hearing kat craig , legal director at the human rights organisation reprieve , criticised fallon for refusing to discuss the similarities between british drone policy and us drone policy .", 
                "she said : it is hardly surprising mr fallon was so reluctant to answer this question , when the uk policy is in effect a carbon copy of the us drone programme .", 
                "both are highly secretive , legally dubious , and subject to almost zero accountability either by politicians or the courts .", 
                "it is bewildering that the uk is following the us lead on a programme which even senior us military figures have described as a 'failed strategy ' which has not made us safer .", 
                "at the very least , mr fallon should come clean with the public that this is the way the uk government is headed , so we can have a real debate .", 
                "fallon said that further drone strikes against terrorist targets were being planned .", 
                "you are drawing me into the discussion of a particular operation .", 
                "there are other operations current , there are other operations that may be planned .", 
                "and it is not really helpful to discuss these things too widely in public .", 
                "philip hammond , the foreign secretary , has said it is possible that talks in new york on friday could lead to a united nations resolution on the same day backing a ceasefire in syria .", 
                "mps have voted to allow fracking for shale gas 1,200m below national parks and other protected sites .", 
                "tony hall , the bbc 's director general , has defended the bbc 's decision to include tyson fury on its annual sports personality of the year shortlist as it was accused by one mp of putting a man holding misogynistic and homophobic views on a pedestal '' .", 
                "the labour mp chuka umunna has accused theresa may of behaving like a nigel farage tribute act '' with her conservative party conference speech on immigration .",

            "text": [
                "mostly sir john major 's intervention will be welcomed in number 10 .", 
                "david cameron wants britain to vote to remain in the eu , and major put the case for staying in strongly .", 
                "as i said earlier ( see 8.50am ) , his willingness to talk about his own frustrations with the eu makes him a more plausible advocate than the uber-europeans , like paddy ashdown or peter mandelson , for example .", 
                "but major did not just say that leaving the eu would be a mistake .", 
                "he explicitly said that flirting with leaving '' was dangerous , implying that david cameron was wrong to even raise this as an option .", 
                "here are the key points .", 
                "i have taken some of the quotes from the press association and from politicshome .", 
                "major said that leaving the eu would be very bad for britain and that even flirting with leaving '' was very dangerous and against our long-term interests '' .", 
                "if there is anyone in the uk who ought to be anti-european and thoroughly frustrated with them then perhaps it ought to be me .", 
                "now , i am not a starry-eyed european , i did after all say no to the euro currency in the early 1990s , i said no to the single market and in 1996 i said no to joining schengen when it began .", 
                "so i am sceptical of a great deal of european union policy .", 
                "but flirting with leaving , at a moment when the whole world is coming together , seems to me to be very dangerous and against our long-term interests .", 
                "we see america and japan and other countries forming a trans-pacific partnership .", 
                "of course , that 's trade , but it is also common standards , bringing people together .", 
                "the whole world is coming together .", 
                "and for the united kingdom , 67m out of a world population of seven billion , to break off and head into splendid isolation , does n't seem to me to be in our interest now or , perhaps more important , in the interests of our children and our grandchildren and future generations .", 
                "whatever the frustrations are and whatever comes out of these negotiations , we are going to be able to continue to try and influence the european union while we are in it .", 
                "he said leaving the eu would probably lead to the break-up of britain , because it might result in scotland voting for independence .", 
                "if we left there must be a high probability that scotland will have another referendum and leave the uk .", 
                "the uk would be fractured , that would be very damaging - our international prestige , i think , would suffer .", 
                "he said that if britain voted to leave , the exit negotiations would be very acrimonious '' .", 
                "they say we can easily negotiate entry to the singe market .", 
                "that 's very disingenuous - if we leave the european union it wo n't be a friendly departure , it will be very acrimonious .", 
                "negotiations with an irate ex-partner could be very difficult .", 
                "we may get a very sub-standard deal to enter the single market .", 
                "he said anti-europeans were wrong to claim that leaving the eu would save the uk a great deal of money .", 
                "people say we can save all our net contribution - not true .", 
                "we would have to pay at least half and possibly more of it simply for entry to the single market .", 
                "he said leaving the eu would not necessarily end the problems with immigration .", 
                "they say we can control our borders and we will have no immigration .", 
                "i do n't think that 's so .", 
                "in or out we ca n't keep the world at bay .", 
                "and if we were out one question arises : in present circumstances would france be holding so many immigrants at calais , or would they not ?", 
                "and if not they would be heading here .", 
                "he said leaving the eu would not boost parliamentary sovereignty .", 
                "we are told our parliament would be sovereign .", 
                "well that of course is total nonsense .", 
                "in order to trade with the european union we would have to accept their regulations .", 
                "we would have no possibility of an input into those regulations or changing them .", 
                "the prime minister will have to go to parliament and say : 'here are some regulations the european union have passed .", 
                "we must pass them without change or we can not trade with europe . '", 
                "so much for parliamentary sovereignty .", 
                "he said that britain should stay in the eu regardless of what cameron 's renegotiation achieved .", 
                "my view is that this renegotiation is important , but that it should n't decide whether or not we remain inside the european union because of the importance of the issue . ''", 
                "he refused to say whether he believed that cameron was sincere in suggesting that he could recommend an out vote if he does not get what he wants in his renegotiation .", 
                "i ca n't put myself inside david cameron 's mind , '' major said .", 
                "( most westminster observers do not believe that cameron would ever back the out campaign , although periodically number 10 manages to get newspapers to report these threats seriously .", 
                "when asked , cameron says he would rule nothing out '' if he does not get what he wants in his renegotiation , but he is never any more specific than that , suggesting some reluctance to make the threat explicit . )", 
                "james naughtie was interviewing major , on his last day presenting the today programme after 21 years .", 
                "major ended with a tribute to him .", 
                "he told naughtie .", 
                "and like millions of other people i have found you and john humphrys my daily diet for a very long time , so if i may grab the airwaves for a moment i would like to say i will miss you .", 
                "and i think a lot of other people will in the morning .", 
                "and i will do so because generally you have asked the right questions .", 
                "mostly you have listened to the answers , but you have done it in an extraordinary professional way .", 
                "so i hope you as you leave you are proud of what you have done and whatever you do now - i do n't know what you are going to do now - but good luck with it and i hope our paths will cross.radio 4 today ( @ bbcr4today ) after 21 years presenting the today programme , jim naughtie just signed off for the last time ."
