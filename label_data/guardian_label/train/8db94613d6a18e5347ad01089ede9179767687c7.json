                "workers are due to be told their fate at 10 o'clock ( bst ) this morning , with an official statement an hour later .", 
                "the move follows monday 's news that steel products group caparo industries had gone into administration and the recent liquidation of the thai owned redcar steelworks on teesside with the loss of 2,200 jobs .", 
                "here 's our latest story : tata steel expected to announce 1,200 job losses in uk read more one of the reasons for the crisis in uk steel is the dumping of cheap imports from china .", 
                "uk prime minister david cameron has promised to raise the issue during the four day visit by chinese president xi jinping .", 
                "selling cheap steel has also caused problems for chinese companies .", 
                "michael hewson at cmc markets said : while the weakness of commodity prices has its upsides , in the form of low inflation , we are now starting to see the downsides with job losses across the board in global manufacturing , not only in the uk , but in the us as well , while china has bailed out one of its own state owned commodity miners , in the form of sinosteel , which has been haemorrhaging cash hand over fist , as it sells steel below market prices .", 
                "deutsche bank 's jim reid said : the story on the chinese soe sinosteel is gathering steam with a bloomberg article noting moments ago that the company delayed an interest payment on its yuan dominated bonds due today .", 
                "the same story suggests that the chinese regulator and state council are working with all related parties in order to try to prevent a default .", 
                "certainly a noteworthy story testing china 's commitment to allowing market reform .", 
                "with the uk government reluctant to bail out the industry , perhaps china 's perceived willingness to act could be something else for cameron and xi jinping to discuss .", 
                "elsewhere today we have results from asos , intercontinental hotels and whitbread , while bank of england governor is up before the treasury select committee this morning ."
