                "but , by general agreement , the political year starts around the beginning of september : either on the tuesday after the august bank holiday ( today ) , or when the prime minister and leader of the opposition get back to work after their summer holidays ( roughly two weeks ago ) , or when the commons returns in september ( a week today ) .", 
                "we 're at the start of a 12-month cycle which , which probably for the first time in four years , wo n't be overshadowed by a major referendum or election .", 
                "but it wo n't be dull .", 
                "it is a year that will be dominated by brexit , by the negotiations in brussels and by the passage of several landmark pieces of legislation through parliament .", 
                "at the moment there is considerable uncertainty about what will happen , but by the time we all get back from our holidays next summer , brexit will be just seven months away , and we should have a much clearer idea of how it will unravel .", 
                "this morning the domestic news is dominated by theresa may 's ( well-trailed ) announcement about corporate governance and executive pay .", 
                "as peter walker explains in his overnight guardian story , may has watered down her original plan to put workers on company boards .", 
                "companies must reveal pay disparity between boss and workers read more the government 's press notice with full details of the announcement is here .", 
                "on the today programme frances o'grady , the tuc general secretary , said she did not think the proposals would make much difference .", 
                "they were feeble '' , she said .", 
                "just a year ago the prime minister repeatedly promised fundamental reform of business .", 
                "and that 's because there was real public concern about boardroom greed , about tax avoidance , and exploitative works practices at the likes of sports direct .", 
                "this response , i 'm afraid , is feeble i 'm afraid the government has bottled it in the face of business lobbying .", 
                "and that does n't bode well for really tackling some of these big problems , like greed at the top , and what 's happening to everybody else 's pay .", 
                "i have to say , if the government had shown an ounce of the enthusiasm for capping top pay that it has shown for capping the pay of firefighters , nurses and teachers , we would probably be in a very different place .", 
                "i will post more from the o'grady interview shortly .", 
                "the commons is still in recess , but we 've got a number 10 lobby briefing at 11a.m as usual , i will be covering breaking political news as it happens , as well as bringing you the best reaction , comment and analysis from the web .",
