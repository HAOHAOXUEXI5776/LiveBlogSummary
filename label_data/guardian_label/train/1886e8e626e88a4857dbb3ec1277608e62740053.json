                "my issue with giving it to dylan is less whether it is deserved or not , and more about what the point of giving it to him is ?", 
                "dylan was already hugely famous , well-known , and internationally venerated .", 
                "fabul0201 14 october 2016 2:19pm seems to me the snobbery against dylan is a bit ridiculous .", 
                "all `` literature '' was originally oral .", 
                "for example the odyssey , beowulf and the mahabharata were sung to illiterate audiences by bards with highly trained memories writing was n't invented until 3000 bc .", 
                "dylan 's had an impact on contemporary culture at least as great as homer , i reckon .", 
                "the effect is most obvious among other songwriters .", 
                "but he has left an indelible mark on even the highest brow forms of art which is so pervasive that we ca n't see it clearly any longer .", 
                "from my own limited reading i would argue salman rushdie , thomas pynchon , e. annie proulx , martin amis , david foster wallace and cormac mccarthy all bear his stamp - just as the sponge-like dylan has received and transmitted things from them .", 
                "someone today said imagine a gathering of survivors after mccarty 's nuclear holocaust where all paper and electronic devices had gone up in smoke - they suggested people would find it easier to reconstruct dylan songs from their memories than the output any star of contemporary `` literary '' london !"
