                "stephen pollard ( @ stephenpollard ) gordon brown seems like the man who first emerged in the 1990s in his speech this morning - erudite , witty , compelling .",

                "sadly , a full text of brown 's speech does not seem to be available .", 
                "but here are the key points from his speech and his q & a .", 
                "brown said the european union was a new form of market , unique in the world , that prevented a dog-eat-dog '' race to the bottom in pay and conditions .", 
                "think of the maximum working week .", 
                "think of holiday pay .", 
                "think of the transfer of undertakings when companies go bust and employees are protected .", 
                "think of the social chapter in europe preventing a race to the bottom , preventing a dog-eat-dog competition between european nations vying with each other for the inward investment that 's available by social dumping and by the lowering of standards .", 
                "we have managed to create something better than that .", 
                "a customs union became a common market , then became a single market , and is now actually a social market .", 
                "underpinning the european union now is the belief that markets need morals .", 
                "underpinning the european union is the idea that markets may be free , but they can never be value free .", 
                "underpinning the european union and the social chapter and social policy is this view that we must prevent a race to the bottom where the good paying country or employer or company is not undercut by the bad , and the bad is not undercut by the worse .", 
                "this is a vision of europe that no other continent , neither america nor asia nor the middle east nor africa , has managed to achieve , that the market is not simply about trade , it is about the rights , economic and social as well as civil and political , of every individual who are part of that 500m people .", 
                "brown praised the eu for its role in ending 1,000 years of warfare on the european continent .", 
                "you 've got to think of the sweep of history here .", 
                "for 1,000 years nations and tribes of europe were fighting to the finish , murdering and maiming each other .", 
                "there is no century , except this one , where europe has been at peace and where nations , whether it be germany or france or spain or netherlands , fighting britain or russia , were not vying for supremacy .", 
                "in every generation but this one , our great-great-grandfathers fighting at waterloo , our great-great-great-grandfathers fighting in the crimea , our grandfathers fighting , many of them , at ypres and at the somme in the first world war , our fathers in many cases fighting at dunkirk and arnhem and on the road to berlin .", 
                "and what has happened in these last 70 years since the second world war is not a temporary truce , it is not simply a ceasefire , it is not simply a peace held together by the threat of arms if it breaks down , it is the development and evolution of a new structure of decision making , where instead of battling with weapons and armaments , people battle only with arguments and ideas .", 
                "he said the eu was valuable because it promoted interdependence , as john f kennedy said it would in a speech more than 50 years ago .", 
                "brown referred to kennedy 's famous inaugural address , but he said he thought the speech kennedy gave in philadelphia in 1962 was even more impressive '' .", 
                "in it kennedy spoke about the importance of interdependence .", 
                "here is an extract from the speech .", 
                "in most of the old colonial world , the struggle for independence is coming to an end .", 
                "even in areas behind the curtain , that which jefferson called the disease of liberty '' still appears to be infectious .", 
                "with the passing of ancient empires , today less than 2 percent of the world 's population lives in territories officially termed dependent . ''", 
                "as this effort for independence , inspired by the american declaration of independence , now approaches a successful close , a great new effort-for interdependence-is transforming the world about us .", 
                "and the spirit of that new effort is the same spirit which gave birth to the american constitution .", 
                "that spirit is today most clearly seen across the atlantic ocean .", 
                "the nations of western europe , long divided by feuds far more bitter than any which existed among the 13 colonies , are today joining together , seeking , as our forefathers sought , to find freedom in diversity and in unity , strength .", 
                "the united states looks on this vast new enterprise with hope and admiration .", 
                "we do not regard a strong and united europe as a rival but as a partner .", 
                "to aid its progress has been the basic object of our foreign policy for years .", 
                "we believe that a united europe will be capable of playing a greater role in the common defense , of responding more generously to the needs of poorer nations , of joining with the united states and others in lowering trade barriers , resolving problems of commerce , commodities , and currency , and developing coordinated policies in all economic , political , and diplomatic areas .", 
                "he said he would be happy to take on boris johnson in a debate .", 
                "asked in the formal q & a if he would be willing to debate johnson , he replied : i 'm happy to take anybody on these days .", 
                "but later , talking to reporters , brown appeared to play down the prospect of such a confrontation taking place .", 
                "this is from the sun 's harry cole .", 
                "harry cole ( @ mrharrycole ) asked gordon if he would take part in tv debates : `` i do n't expect to be asked to be honest . ''", 
                "would n't say if pm should .", 
                "brown accused johnson of being inconsistent on europe .", 
                "he said : boris is making statements today that if set against statement he made a year ago , two years ago or five years ago , might make it look as if he 's saying different things from what he had two or three years ago when he seemed to be more enthusiastic about the european union .", 
                "brown claimed that illegal immigration was a bigger problem than legal immigration .", 
                "and illegal immigration could only be tackled by international cooperation , he said .", 
                "if you look around the world at the moment , the biggest problem in migration is illegal and irregular immigration .", 
                "and if you think about how you cope with that problem of immigration , then you only cope with that by cooperation between countries where people are coming through these countries into europe i say , when we are talking about migration , the biggest problem is going to be , and probably is now , illegal immigration .", 
                "and the way to deal with that is through international cooperation .", 
                "but he acknowledged that legal immigration put a pressure on public services .",
