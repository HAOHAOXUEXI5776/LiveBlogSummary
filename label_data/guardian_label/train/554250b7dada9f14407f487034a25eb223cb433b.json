                "david cameron has said that the legislative programme unveiled by the queen at the state opening of parliament is designed to stop britain being a two-speed country '' .", 
                "in an introduction to the government 's 103-page briefing document ( pdf ) on the plans , reproduced on facebook , he claimed it was a one nation queen 's speech from a one nation government '' .", 
                "in his speech in the commons he said he wanted to increase the pace of reform in education '' and he brushed aside calls for ministers to be allowed a free vote in the forthcoming eu referendum .", 
                "he also challenged labour to prove it backed aspiration by voting for the government 's proposed tax cuts .", 
                "in recent days , i have noticed some of the candidates for the labour leadership seem to have discovered a new word : the word being aspiration .", 
                "apparently it has upset john prescott , he went on television to explain he does n't know what it means .", 
                "i am happy we should spend the next five years explaining what it means and how vital it is to everyone in our country .", 
                "if the party opposite truly believe in aspiration , they will vote with us to cut people 's taxes so people can spend more of their own money as they choose .", 
                "if they believe in aspiration , they will be voting with us to cap welfare and use the savings to fund more apprenticeships .", 
                "some may question cameron 's commitment to one nation politics ( see 11.34am ) and it is probably best to interpret cameron 's constant use of the phrase partly as a sign of how worried cameron is about the standing of the conservatives outside england .", 
                "there is a telling passage on this in the house of commons 's excellent briefing note on the results of the 2015 election ( pdf ) .", 
                "318 ( 96 % ) of the conservative 's 330 mps have seats in england , where the party won 40.9 % of the vote .", 
                "the government elected in may 2015 holds the lowest number of scottish seats of any government .", 
                "it also won the lowest share of the vote in both wales ( 27.2 % ) and scotland ( 14.9 % ) of any government since 1945 .", 
                "labour and union leaders have criticised plans in the queen 's speech that could lead to the chief source of funding for the labour party - the trade union political funds - facing big cuts .", 
                "as patrick wintour reports , the trade union bill , put forward by the frontbench conservative mp sajid javid , will create a shift from a current system whereby union members have to contract out from paying the political levy to one in which they have to contract in .", 
                "the change , from a system of inertia to one in which members actively choose to pay , is likely to lead to a big dropoff in income to the unions .", 
                "paul kenny , the gmb general secretary , said this was anti-democratic .", 
                "it 's one rule for the tory slush fund , hedge funds and another for trade union members .", 
                "this will not deter or silence the voices of millions of working people who already give their approval for political funds through democratic ballots governed by statute .", 
                "it will bring state funding for political parties a step nearer .", 
                "it is not sustainable to allow the elite and companies unfettered and unlimited rights to fund the tory party while shackling the bodies that have funded the political opposition to them for more than a century .", 
                "harriet harman , the acting labour leader , has told mps that the reality of the queen 's speech does not match its rhetoric .", 
                "in her speech she said : the queen 's speech talks of one nation '' - yet he sets the nations of the country against each other .", 
                "the queen 's speech talks of 'working people ' - yet he threatens basic rights at work .", 
                "at a time when our economy , our constitution and our public services are all fragile , we fear this tory government will make things worse .", 
                "so as the dust settles , the real question for this queen 's speech is - will it improve our country , our communities and people 's lives ?", 
                "nick clegg , the outgoing lib dem leader , has said cameron should spell out what he wants to achieve from his eu renegotiation .", 
                "in his speech he told mps : this must be the first time in living memory that a country 's citizens are being asked to support the outcome of a renegotiation on a matter of such importance to its place in the world without the government of the day setting out in this house what it wants to achieve .", 
                "and because we do not know what the government considers a successful negotiation , we do not know for sure which side the prime minister will take in a referendum so my advice to the government is this : pursue your renegotiation with the eu , but spell out exactly what you hope to achieve , so that people understand the choice that 's in front of them .", 
                "clegg also said that , although the government was acting now as if it expected to win the referendum easily , it should be careful , because circumstances could change .", 
                "having witnessed two referenda spin off in entirely unpredicted directions in recent years , i would strongly counsel against any complacency , '' he said .", 
                "john bercow , the commons speaker , has reprimanded snp mps for clapping their westminster leader , angus robertson .", 
                "bercow told them : can i say at the start of the parliament that the convention that we do n't clap in this chamber is very , very , very long-established and widely respected ?", 
                "and it would be appreciated if members would show some respect for that convention .", 
                "they will get their speaking rights from this chair - of that they can be assured .", 
                "they will be respected but i would invite them to show some respect for the traditions of this chamber of the house of commons .", 
                "senior tories are telling david cameron he must abandon a deeply offensive '' threat to withdraw from the european convention on human rights if he is to win support for his plans to repeal the human rights act .", 
                "lord wallace of tankerness , the lib dem leader in the lords , has told peers that the lords has the right to block government legislation - even if it was in the government 's manifesto .", 
                "under the salisbury convention , peers are supposed to refrain from voting down measures that were in the manifesto of the governing party .", 
                "in a speech , wallace acknowledged that .", 
                "but he implied that the lords could ignore this in some circumstances .", 
                "it is of course right and proper that we uphold the measures which allow our revising chamber to remain a self-regulating house .", 
                "i do not question the right of the house of commons and a government who command the confidence of it to have its legislation dealt with in a constructive manner by this house .", 
                "but we may wish to reflect on the strength of the mandate of a government , which secured less than 37 % of the popular vote on a turnout of 66 % , should it seek to drive through ill-thought through and reactionary legislation without the robust scrutiny and the proper checks and balances , provided by this house .", 
                "the government would do well to remember that the cunningham report on the conventions of the uk parliament , which recognised the right of this house , in extreme and exceptional circumstances , to say no .", 
                "the importance of the house of lords retaining the right to say no is that it is that power which brings the government to the table in a constructive frame of mind this house has demonstrated time and time again that it is the last bastion of defence of civil liberties and human rights .", 
                "on these issues in particular , this house has a legitimate right to question the excesses of any government .", 
                "it has the right to vigorously scrutinise and revise legislation .", 
                "tony blair has announced he will step down next month as special representative of the quartet of the international powers seeking a peace agreement between israel and the palestinians .", 
                "tavish scott , the former scottish lib dem leader , has said he feels let down by the behaviour of alistair carmichael , who admitted that he was responsible for a pre-election leak intended to damage nicola sturgeon .", 
                "that 's all from us for today .",
