                "she has given the odd-wide ranging speech - like this one to a conservativehome conference in 2013 , which was seen as a leadership bid - but anyone trying to write the definite guide to mayism would have difficulty .", 
                "after today it would be a lot easier .", 
                "may 's speech this morning focused mainly on the economy and it was packed with ideas .", 
                "the key news line this morning was probably what she had to say about brexit .", 
                "may categorically ruled out a second referendum , and insisted that the uk would leave the eu under her premiership .", 
                "many of our political and business leaders have responded by showing that they still do n't get it .", 
                "there are politicians - democratically-elected politicians - who seriously suggest that the government should find a way of ignoring the referendum result and keeping britain inside the european union .", 
                "and there are business leaders whose response has not been to plan for britain 's departure or to think of the opportunities withdrawal presents - but to complain about the result and criticise the electorate .", 
                "well , i could n't be clearer .", 
                "brexit means brexit .", 
                "and we 're going to make a success of it .", 
                "there will be no attempts to remain inside the eu , no attempts to rejoin it by the back door , and no second referendum .", 
                "the country voted to leave the european union , and as prime minister i will make sure that we leave the european union .", 
                "but the real interest in the speech lay in what it revealed about her thinking .", 
                "based on this text , it would be reasonable to assume that the may has lifted many of her ideas from four prominent leftwingers .", 
                "1 - the \u0080\u0098gordon brown ' theresa may when gordon brown was chancellor he talked endlessly about the need to improve productivity .",

                "( it is also worth noting that this paragraph contains a minor swipe at george osborne and his northern powerhouse plan ; the government should be helping all big cities , not just manchester , she is saying . )", 
                "2 - the \u0080\u0098will hutton ' theresa may younger readers may not remember stakeholder capitalism , a notion championed by the journalist and writer will hutton , but for about five minutes it was tony blair 's favourite philosophy , and may revived it in her speech .", 
                "she said : if we are going to have an economy that works for everyone , we are going to need to give people more control of their lives .", 
                "and that means cutting out all the political platitudes about stakeholder societies - and doing something radical .", 
                "because as we saw when cadbury 's - that great birmingham company - was bought by kraft , or when astrazeneca was almost sold to pfizer , transient shareholders - who are mostly companies investing other people 's money - are not the only people with an interest when firms are sold or close .", 
                "workers have a stake , local communities have a stake , and often the whole country has a stake .", 
                "it is hard to think of an industry of greater strategic importance to britain than its pharmaceutical industry , and astrazeneca is one of the jewels in its crown .", 
                "yet two years ago the government almost allowed astrazeneca to be sold to pfizer , the us company with a track record of asset stripping and whose self-confessed attraction to the deal was to avoid tax .", 
                "a proper industrial strategy would n't automatically stop the sale of british firms to foreign ones , but it should be capable of stepping in to defend a sector that is as important as pharmaceuticals is to britain .",

                "from robert peel to lady thatcher , from joseph chamberlain to winston churchill , throughout history it has been the conservative party 's role to rise to the occasion and to take on the vested interests before us , to break up power when it is concentrated among the few , to lead on behalf of the people .", 
                "more significantly , may announced several policy proposals that were pure miliband .", 
                "as reported overnight , she called for workers to be represented on company boards ( going slightly further than labour did in its 2015 manifesto ) .", 
                "she also called for action on excessive executive pay and on cartels .", 
                "as part of the changes i want to make to corporate governance , i want to make shareholder votes on corporate pay not just advisory but binding .", 
                "i want to see more transparency , including the full disclosure of bonus targets and the publication of pay multiple data : that is , the ratio between the ceo 's pay and the average company worker 's pay .", 
                "and i want to simplify the way bonuses are paid so that the bosses ' incentives are better aligned with the long-term interests of the company and its shareholders .", 
                "i also want us to be prepared to use - and reform - competition law so that markets work better for people .", 
                "if there is evidence that the big utility firms and the retail banks are abusing their roles in highly-consolidated markets , we should n't just complain about it , we should n't say it 's too difficult , we should do something about it .", 
                "miliband also draw up plans to stop banks and energy companies exploiting consumers .", 
                "two of his most senior advisers - the labour peer stewart wood , who advised miliband on policy , and tom baldwin , miliband 's communications chief - have accused may of plagiarism .", 
                "stewart wood ( @ stewartwood ) good to see theresa may reaffirming her commitment to the 2015 election manifesto .",
