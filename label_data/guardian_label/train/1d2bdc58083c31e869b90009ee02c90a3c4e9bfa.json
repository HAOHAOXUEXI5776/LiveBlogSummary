                "the introduction to the report says enough , really : greece 's public debt has become highly unsustainable .", 
                "this is due to the easing of policies during the last year , with the recent deterioration in the domestic macroeconomic and financial environment because of the closure of the banking system adding significantly to the adverse dynamics .", 
                "the financing need through end-2018 is now estimated at \u20ac85bn and debt is expected to peak at close to 200 percent of gdp in the next two years , provided that there is an early agreement on a program .", 
                "greece 's debt can now only be made sustainable through debt relief measures that go far beyond what europe has been willing to consider so far .", 
                "the imf 's fundamental conclusion is that greece will simply not be able to borrow at affordable rates again , until its debt burden is lower .", 
                "the situation was already bad - but recent developments make it much , much worse .", 
                "the events of the past two weeks today 's report is light on projections , but the ones included are stark enough .", 
                "the stand-out fact : greek debt is on track to peak at close to 200 % of gdp in the next two years .", 
                "only japan , after two lost decades , comes close to that ratio .", 
                "perhaps this is why the us government , led by treasury secretary jack lew , has been so vocal about the need for debt sustainability to be addressed ?", 
                "the imf is also amusingly sniffy about the targets greece is being set .", 
                "for example : medium-term primary surplus target : greece is expected to maintain primary surpluses for the next several decades of 3.5 percent of gdp .",
