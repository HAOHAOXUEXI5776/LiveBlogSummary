            "text": [
                "wigglesworth/pa as suspected , mark carney faced some robust questioning at today 's quarterly inflation report .", 
                "the governor found himself having to defend the bank 's forecasting powers , after it almost doubled its forecast for 2017 growth ( to 1.4 % ) , just three months after slashing it drastically .", 
                "he also repeatedly fended off questions about his own future , and whether he could possibly be lured to stay beyond june 2019 .", 
                "personally i ca n't believe he 'd reject the chance for more meetings with the uk economics press pack .", 
                "but what did we learn ?", 
                "1 ) life is going to get tougher , especially for poorer families .", 
                "carney warned that inflation will take a real bite out of earnings , saying : we see very modest real income growth over the course of next year and into 2018 .", 
                "that 's because the cpi rate is expected to surge to 2.7 % in 2017 , and hit 2.8 % in 2018 - which is higher than wage growth today .", 
                "and he said the bank is facing a balancing act between allowing inflation to rise over target ( driving down real wages ) and higher unemployment ( which would happen if the bank tightened monetary policy ) .", 
                "2 ) the economy is doing better than the bank expected alongside death and taxes , you can be pretty certain that the bank of england 's economic forecasts will be tweaked before long .", 
                "but still , today 's upward revisions to growth in 2016 and 2017 are quite significant - and show that the boe was too gloomy about the immediate impact of voting to leave the eu .", 
                "carney painted a of serene calm : the mpc had expected consumption to continue to grow solidly throughout the remainder of 2016 .", 
                "but consumption has been even stronger , with households appearing to entirely look through brexit-related uncertainties .", 
                "for households , the signs of an economic slowdown are notable by their absence .", 
                "perceptions of job security remain strong .", 
                "wages are growing at around the same modest pace as at the start of the year .", 
                "credit is available and competitive .", 
                "confidence is solid .", 
                "indeed , he had to pour cold water on the suggestion that consumers are being stupid by still hitting the high street .", 
                "3 ) but there are signs that things are getting worse the bank still sees signs that firms are cutting back , as they watch brexit play out : that uncertainty does bear down on business investment , that effect builds with time , that lower business investment has consequences for employment .", 
                "4 ) we should get used to brexit uncertainty the governor said that today 's court ruling that mps must vote on article 50 is simply an example of the drama we should get used to , as britain leaves the eu .", 
                "obviously i am not qualified to comment on the court judgment or the prospects here , but it is an example of the uncertainty that will characterise this process .", 
                "the negotiations have n't even yet begun , there will be uncertainty , there will be volatility around those negotiations as they proceed , and i would view this as one example of that uncertainty .", 
                "5 ) the next interest rate move could be up .", 
                "britain 's primary schools are full of children who were n't even born when the bank last raised interest rates ( it was july 2007 , just before the credit crunch ) .", 
                "and a few months ago , many city economists were convinced rates would fall to 0.1 % soon .", 
                "not any more , with the boe dropping its guidance that the next move is probably down .", 
                "as carney puts it : you can envisage scenarios where it goes either way .", 
                "we do n't have a bias in terms of direction of where the next move will be .", 
                "again , in a period of a fair bit of uncertainty you can envisage scenarios where either direction would be merited .", 
                "make of that what you will katie allen ( @ katieallengdn ) carney asked if next rate move more likely up or down : `` you can envision scenarios where either direction is merited '' `` could go either way '' sathnam sanghera ( @ sathnam ) this is basically me deciding between nandos and wagamama 6 ) the bank of england is n't at war with downing street .", 
                "asked about theresa may 's criticism of monetary policy , he argued : we do n't feel under any pressure from the government , certainly none from the prime minister .", 
                "i think the prime minister fully supports , and the government fully supports , the monetary policy framework we have in place and in that framework we take those decisions .", 
                "and he also indicated he accepted criticism from mps , as part of the bank 's accountability .", 
                "he would n't say whether some critics should take a vow of silence , alas ."

            "text": [
                "bank of england governor mark carney leaving 10 downing street on monday neal/getty images good morning , and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy , the financial markets , the eurozone and business .", 
                "it 's super thursday - the time each quarter when the bank of england sets interest rates , issues its new assessment of the uk economy , and submits its governor for a grilling from the uk economics press .", 
                "and mark carney may have a lot of explaining to do .", 
                "that 's partly because the bank is expected to revise up its short-term growth forecasts ; an admission it was too gloomy about the impact of the brexit vote .", 
                "back in august , the boe said growth would slow sharply to just 0.1 % in july-september ; actually , it was a robust 0.5 % .", 
                "carney could say the stimulus measures taken by the bank are having an effect , but critics will continue to argue that he were too gloomy about brexit .", 
                "some economists expect the boe to lower its medium-term growth forecasts , as it tries to assess the impact of britain leaving the eu .", 
                "that 's a tricky calculation , as we do n't know what kind of deal the uk will end up with .", 
                "the bank may also hike its inflation forecasts , as the slump in the pound since june continues to push up the cost of imports .", 
                "that could show the consumer prices index smashing through the official 2 % target next year .", 
                "if that happens , how long will the bank be prepared to ignore the rising cost of living ?", 
                "and of course , carney can expect several questions about his decision to extend his term by an extra 12 months , to summer 2019 .", 
                "has the criticism from pro-brexit mps deterred him from staying until 2021 ?", 
                "and has the bank 's independence been undermined ?", 
                "ranjiv mann , head of global sovereign research & strategy at rogge global partners , expects carney to revise up his 2016 growth forecast , but still sound cautious .", 
                "he says : we expect another 9-0 vote to leave monetary policy unchanged sterling depreciation is set to send cpi inflation above the 2 % inflation target in 2017/18 however , the bank will want to affirm its easing bias , particularly if it lowers its projections for medium term growth prospects the interest rate decision comes at noon , along with the quarterly inflation report mark carney 's press conference begins at 12.30pm , and runs for an hour .", 
                "also coming up today there will be high drama at 10am , when the uk high court rules on whether theresa may can start the process of exiting the eu without a parliamentary vote .", 
                "owen bowcott , our legal affairs correspondent , sets the scene : the lord chief justice is to deliver the high court 's momentous decision on whether parliament or the government has the constitutional power to trigger brexit .", 
                "after less than three weeks considering the politically charged case with two other senior judges , lord thomas of cwmgiedd will read out a summary of their decision at 10am on thursday to a packed courtroom in london 's royal courts of justice .", 
                "in order to prevent leaks of the market-sensitive ruling , which involves a large number of parties , preliminary drafts of the judgment have unusually not been sent out in advance to the lawyers .", 
                "the outcome of the case , which ventures into constitutionally untested ground , will resolve whether mps or ministers have the authority to formally inform brussels about whether the uk intends to leave the european union .", 
                "high court to declare verdict on whether uk government has right to trigger brexit read more on the corporate front , supermarket morrisons , insurance chain rsa gold miner randgold and food group tate & lyle are all reporting to the city .", 
                "at 9.30am , we find out how fast britain 's services sector grew last month .", 
                "and there 's a flurry of us economic data this afternoon , including a healthcheck on the service sector for october , and factory orders for september ."
