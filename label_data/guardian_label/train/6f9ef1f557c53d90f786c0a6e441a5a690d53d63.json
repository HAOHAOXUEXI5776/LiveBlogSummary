                "omand said the current legislation governing surveillance was very , very complicated '' and not easy to follow '' .", 
                "he indicated that he expected anderson to conclude that the bulk collection of data was justified , but that it needed to be controlled by a framework making allowance for rights to privacy and free speech .", 
                "he said there was an issue to be resolved as to whether politicians or judges approved surveillance operations .", 
                "it would be , i think , unconscionable for a judge to authorise a very sensitive intelligence operation where the political risk , if it went wrong , fell on the home secretary , or overseas the foreign secretary , who would know nothing about it and would n't have approved it .", 
                "so you 've got to have a system where sensitive national security operations are actually approved by ministers who will in the end have to bear the risk .",

                "somehow that has got to be worked through .",
