                "the jobs data helped push us markets sharply higher , with both the s & p 500 and nasdaq composite hitting new peaks .", 
                "meanwhile in asia , the nikkei 225 added 1.6 % , closing above 20,000 for the first time since 2015 .", 
                "europe is also forecast to make a strong start , with the ftse 100 on track for a new intra-day peak : igsquawk ( @ igsquawk ) our european opening calls : $ ftse 7593 +0.65 % $ dax 12740 +0.59 % $ cac 5352 +0.63 % $ ibex 10963 +0.75 % $ mib 21091 +0.74 % michael hewson , chief market analyst at cmc markets uk , said : european markets look set for a strong open this morning having started on the front foot yesterday , helped by a continuation of the recent theme of an improving economic environment , as further improvements in economic data fuelled a positive start to the month , which was carried on in the us , after europe had closed .", 
                "this rise in us markets saw yet more record closes across the board , after a singularly upbeat adp payrolls report showed that the us economy added 253k jobs in may , well above expectations of 177k .", 
                "this bumper number more or less confirmed the prospect of a june rate rise , with the potential for further moves later in the year , maybe in september , if the economy holds up .", 
                "yesterday 's number also raises the bar for today 's official payrolls report which is expected to come in at around the 180k level , down from 211k in april .", 
                "this seems rather conservative given the decent adp number , and the fairly close correlation between the two we 've seen over the last few months , the march outlier notwithstanding .", 
                "this would suggest that a number in excess of 200k for non-farm payrolls would be more in line with expectations today 's average hourly earnings data for may is [ also ] likely to be closely scrutinised with a modest increase from 2.5 % to 2.6 % expected .", 
                "before all that , come uk construction figures .", 
                "in april the construction pmi was lifted by civil engineering and housebuilding and came in at 53.1 .", 
                "this time round it is expected to slip to around 52.7 , but this is still a reasonable performance following thursday 's positive manufacturing figures .", 
                "here 's the agenda ( all times bst ) : 9.30 : markit/cips uk construction pmi 10.00 : eurozone producer prices index 13.30 : us non-farm payrolls data we 'll be tracking all the main events throughout the day ."
