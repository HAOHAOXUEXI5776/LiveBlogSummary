            "text": [
                "as promised , here is more from the detail of the yougov poll .", 
                "i posted the key findings at 9.02am .", 
                "here are 10 more findings from the survey .", 
                "1 - corbyn 's key strength is that he is seen as principled '' .", 
                "some 76 % of the labour selectorate said they saw him this way .", 
                "he also scored well for honesty ( 64 % ) and for shares my political outlook '' 58 % .", 
                "but only 33 % of the labour selectorate as a whole said he was likely to lead the party to victory at the election , and only 35 % said he was competent .", 
                "this is from the new statesman 's stephen bush .", 
                "stephen bush ( @ stephenkb ) hard to sustain from these numbers that labour members are `` mad '' or in denial about corbyn 's failings .", 
                "people planning to vote for corbyn in the contest were more likely to rate his competence and electability , but even amongst this group only 56 % said he was likely to lead the party to victory , and only 60 % said he was competent .", 
                "2 - smith 's key strength is that he is seen as competent '' .", 
                "but only 30 % of the labour selectorate said they saw him as competent - a remarkably low figure , given that he has put this trait at the centre of his leadership campaign .", 
                "his biggest weakness is that he is seen as untrustworthy '' - by 45 % of those voting in the contest .", 
                "3 - smith is seen as even less likely than corbyn to lead labour to victory at the general election by those voting in the contest .", 
                "only 12 % of them said they thought smith was likely to win the general election for the party .", 
                "and even amongst those planning to vote for smith the figure was only 33 % .", 
                "4 - women seem to be more pro-corbyn than men .", 
                "the yougov crosstabs have 67 % of female members of the labour selectorate backing corbyn , but only 57 % of men .", 
                "crosstab findings are less reliable than the headline poll findings ( because they involve a smaller sample ) , but a 10-point gap is quite big , and so some gender gap is probably real .", 
                "during the campaign smith has been accused of sexism , and corbyn 's advantage with women may be a result .", 
                "5 - corbyn 's support is broadly consistent amongst all age groups .", 
                "it is often assumed that his backing comes from the young .", 
                "but the crosstabs ( in so far as they are reliable - see above ) suggest age is not a factor in his support .", 
                "his ratings are 61 % amongst 18 to 24-year-olds , 64 % amongst 25 to 39-year-olds , 63 % amongst 40 to 59-year-olds and 57 % amongst over-60s .", 
                "6 - a majority of labour members are in favour of getting rid of the nuclear deterrent .", 
                "some 53 % of those voting in the leadership contest , and 52 % of those voting because they are full party members , think britain should get rid of nuclear missiles .", 
                "only 23 % of party members favour full trident renewal , while another 14 % of members favour replacing the trident submarines but not equipping them with nuclear missiles .", 
                "these figures suggest corbyn , who is in favour of nuclear disarmament , would be able to win a vote on trident if he put it to a ballot of party members .", 
                "but this would involve bypassing the normal policy-making procedure , a vote at party conference .", 
                "corbyn would find it much harder to win a conference vote on this because unions have 50 % of the vote at conference and the big unions are pro-trident because they want to preserve defence jobs .", 
                "7 - corbyn 's supporters are more likely to leave the labour party if they do not get the leader they want than smith 's .", 
                "corbyn 's supporters sometimes accuse their opponents of wanting to split the party ( john mcdonnell has said this explicitly . )", 
                "but the yougov poll suggests the corbynistas would be more likely to walk away .", 
                "asked what would happen if corbyn won , and his opponents formed a rival party , 18 % of members said they would leave and join it .", 
                "but when asked what would happen if smith won , and his opponents formed a rival party , 32 % of members said they would leave and join it .", 
                "update : on twitter and perhaps btl ( i have't read comments yet ) readers have challenged this on a couple of grounds .", 
                "first , genie research points out that , given there are almost twice as many corbyn backers as smith backers , it is not surprising that corbyn backers seem more included to split .", 
                "genie research ( @ genieresearch ) @ andrewsparrow maths is wrong on 7/10 : corbynite propensity to leave = 32/62 = 52 % ; smithite ptl = 18/38 = 47 % .", 
                "a very small gap - half each the crosstabs present slightly different figures .", 
                "amongst those planning to vote corbyn , 54 % would join a new party if they did not get the leadership result they wanted .", 
                "amongst smith supporters , the figure is 45 % .", 
                "so there is a difference - but it is not a big one .", 
                "second , some readers think the first sentence in paragraph 7 is misleading because the yougov questions were based on the assumption that mps might split and form a new party , and arguably it is the anti-corbynites in the plp who are most likely to do this .", 
                "it is certainly true that no pro-corbyn mps have been talking about forming a new party if corbyn loses .", 
                "but anti-corbyn mps do not seem to be seriously talking about a new party either .", 
                "there are reports that some of them are considering setting up a new gropu in parliament .", 
                "but launching an entirely new party would be hugely problematic , and i am not aware of any mp advocating this .", 
                "what is true is that some people who used to support other parties ( eg , the greens , tusc ) have joined labour because they like corbyn .", 
                "it is easy to see them leaving if he were replaced - although that is not the same as them defecting to form a new party .", 
                "8 - more than a third of those voting in the contest ( 39 % ) think it is likely the labour will split when it is over .", 
                "9 - almost half of those voting in the contest ( 48 % ) think labour mps should be subjected to mandatory reselection .", 
                "10 - the traingate controversy damaged corbyn 's standing in the contest - but not by much .", 
                "some 20 % of those voting in the contest said they had a more negative view of him as a result of it , against 10 % who said they had a more positive view of him as a result .", 
                "almost 70 % said it had no effect on their thinking .", 
                "as i said earlier ( see 9.02am ) yougov 's record last year suggests this poll is likely to be a reasonably reliable guide to the eventual outcome .", 
                "but in his own write-up of the survey , yougov 's matthew smith says it is important to remember the various factors that could lead to the final result being different .", 
                "there are a number of important caveats that should be highlighted .", 
                "our survey sample is composed of 1,236 members of the labour selectorate , with the representation levels of difference membership types ( member/supporter/union affiliate ) based on how each group turned out in the 2015 leadership election .", 
                "changes in turnout have the potential to affect the results : this is particularly true of trade union affiliates ( amongst whom turnout was low in 2015 ) given that the gmb is under new leadership and has come out for smith this time round .", 
                "the make-up of registered supporters is also difficult to judge , whilst the effects and scale of labour party membership suspensions also has the potential to make a difference .", 
                "last , but not least , there are still three weeks left to vote , and unforeseen events could drastically affect the course of the contest .", 
                "nevertheless , team corbyn will be pleased by the security afforded by the double digit lead they are currently sitting on ."
