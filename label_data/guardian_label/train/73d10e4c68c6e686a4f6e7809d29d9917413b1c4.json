                "the ftse 250 may be slumping faster than the top 100 index , but this is not the full michael hewson , chief market analyst at cmc markets uk , says : the ftse250 has borne the brunt of the sell-off in the uk market , dropping below its february lows , due to its heavier exposure to the uk economy , having fallen over 2,000 points in the last two days .", 
                "in order to give some perspective though over a five year time frame the does look somewhat different , with the ftse100 only up 6 % in that period , while the ftse250 is still up over 30 % , well above levels seen in back in 2011 when it was trading around the 10,500 level .", 
                "elsewhere the banks are under pressure , and not just in the uk where royal bank of scotland is currently down 15 % and barclays 17 % lower .", 
                "hewson again : deutsche bank has once again hit new record lows while italian banks have also remained under pressure , with unicredit , monti dei paschi and popolare all down heavily at new all-time lows , as concerns about the huge amount of non-performing loans prompt new concerns about their solvency .", 
                "reports that the italian government is weighing up measures that could add up to \u20ac40bn into italian lenders have n't been enough to support the share prices , probably down to the fact that these banks have non-performing loans in excess of \u20ac300bn .",
