                "although much shorter than a previous version and with less in brackets - indicating disagreement - the reaction was mixed .", 
                "suzanne goldenberg and our team here in paris rounded up some of delegates first thoughts on the draft late last night : miguel arias ca\u00f1ete , the eu energy commissioner , acknowledged the gaps .", 
                "the text is not bold enough as it stands , '' he said .", 
                "we will work to improve it .", 
                "we invite other countries to join us . ''", 
                "the european union said the removal from the text of any reference to emissions from shipping and aviation betrayed unacceptable levels of low ambition '' .", 
                "australia complained about a lack of balance '' and russia advised the only way forward was to re-negotiate the document line by line .", 
                "trinidad and tobago 's delegate warned the paris agreement would be seriously flawed '' if it did not stick to an ambitious 1.5c target to limiting warming .", 
                "barbados offered even stronger language , warning : we will not sign off any agreement that represents a certain extinction of our people . ''", 
                "south africa said the text was a significant departure and dilution from principles that have guided the talks in the past .", 
                "today , french foreign minister , laurent fabius , has promised us a new version of the text this afternoon .", 
                "some negotiators were up as late as 4.30am , so we 'll soon see what their post-midnight deliberations have yielded .", 
                "we 'll have a guide later this morning to the main sticking points remaining .",
