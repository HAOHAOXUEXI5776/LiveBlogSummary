                "lady paton and lord matthews had previously ruled that a false statement by a candidate about his own personal character or conduct made before or during an election for the purpose of affecting his return at the election has the effect of engaging section 106 '' of the 1983 act .",

                "the court said alistair carmichael had told a blatant lie '' about his knowledge of the leak .", 
                "on the first issue , the court observed that the first respondent [ mr carmichael ] had told a blatant lie '' when , in the course of a channel 4 interview on sunday 5 april 2015 , he claimed that he had only become aware when contacted by a journalist of a memo leaked to the press by his special adviser euan roddin , which stated that first minister and leader of the snp nicola sturgeon had told the french ambassador that she 'd rather see david cameron remain as pm '' .", 
                "lady paton said : there is no dispute that the words 'i told you the first i became aware of this , and this is already on public record , was when i received a phone call on friday afternoon [ i.e .",

                "but the court said carmichael 's lie did not relate to a general statement about his character .", 
                "however , on the matter of whether the lie could properly be characterised as a false statement of fact in relation to [ his ] personal character or conduct '' , the judges were left with a reasonable doubt .", 
                "it is of the essence of section 106 that it does not apply to lies in general : it applies only to lies in relation to the personal character or conduct of a candidate made before or during an election for the purpose of affecting that candidate 's return , '' lady paton said .", 
                "the judges gave some examples of what might be regarded as false statements of fact in relation to personal character or conduct .", 
                "they explained that if a candidate made a false statement that he would never leak an internal confidential memo , no matter how helpful that might be to his party , as he regarded the practice of leaking confidential information as dishonest and morally reprehensible , and he would not stoop to such tactics , when in fact that candidate had leaked an internal confidential memo containing material which was inaccurate and highly damaging to an opponent , they would be likely to conclude that the candidate had given a false statement 'in relation to [ his ] personal character or conduct '' because he would be falsely holding himself out as being of such a standard of honesty , honour , trustworthiness and integrity that , in contrast with what others in westminster might do , he would never be involved in such a leaking exercise .", 
                "in the present case , when speaking to the channel 4 interviewer , the first respondent did not make such an express statement about his personal character or conduct , '' lady paton continued .",

                "in his view , if public attention remained focused on that political message , voters who had anxieties about scottish independence might find voting for the snp a less attractive prospectthe inescapable inference , in our opinion , is that if the snp became a less attractive prospect , the first respondent 's chances of a comfortable majority in what had become a 'two-horse race ' in orkney and shetland would be enhanced .
