                "she said that as the negotiation started , she would seek to represent every person in the whole united kingdom - young and old , rich and poor , city , town , country and all the villages and hamlets in between '' .", 
                "the fact that downing street chose to put up philip hammond for their main interview this morning , ahead of may 's statement at lunchtime , is indicative of her desire to adopt a consensual approach , or at least to show that she is accommodating the concerns of remainers .", 
                "hammond is the most pro-remain member of the cabinet .", 
                "on brexit , his position is hard to distinguish from the official labour policy as set out by its brexit spokesman , sir keir starmer .", 
                "but it was not just that hammond was there , it was what he said .", 
                "for the past nine months most of what the government has said and done on brexit has been warmly welcomed by hardcore tory leave campaigners and has alarmed those holding out for a softer '' brexit .", 
                "this morning , on several issues , hammond distanced himself from the hardcore leave agenda .", 
                "that suggests that perhaps the government 's brexit strategy might not be quite as confrontational as had been thought .", 
                "here are the key points .", 
                "hammond said the government accepted it could not cherry in the brexit talks and that leaving would have consequences '' .", 
                "in a reference to the phrase associated with boris johnson , and his leave philosophy , hammond said the uk could not have its cake and eat it .", 
                "we accept that because of our requirements , because of the requirements that the british people specified in the referendum result , we will not be members of the european single market , we will not be full members of the european customs union .", 
                "and not being members of those entities has some consequences .", 
                "it carries some significance .", 
                "and the european union understands that .", 
                "and i think the fact that we have set that out very clearly has sent a clear signal to our european partners that we understand that we ca n't cherry that we ca n't have our cake and eat it , that by deciding to leave the european union and negotiate a future relationship with the eu as an independent nation , there will be certain consequences of that .", 
                "and we accept those .", 
                "in policy terms this does not amount to anything new .", 
                "may said in her lancaster house speech that the uk would leave the single market and not remain a full member of the customs union .", 
                "but , in terms of expectation management , this is a subtle but important shift .", 
                "throughout the referendum campaign vote leave repeatedly claimed that the uk would be able to leave the eu but continue to trade with europe on terms just as good as the current ones ( having one 's cake and eating it '' , in johnson 's terminology ) .", 
                "since the referendum brexiter cabinet ministers have continued to make this claim , often with reference to german bmw manufacturers and italian prosecco exports .", 
                "by talking about consequences '' , hammond was trying to reframe the debate with a dose of realism .", 
                "he suggested that the government has given up plans to use today as the cut-off point after which eu nationals arriving in the uk will not necessarily have their rights guaranteed .", 
                "the government has said it wants to guarantee the rights of eu nationals in the uk , but has not specified a cut-off date .", 
                "at one point it was suggested it would be today .", 
                "but , when asked about this , hammond refused to confirm it , and stressed that eu nationals would still be able to come to the uk after today and that the uk was still a member of the eu .", 
                "his words implied the cut-off date will be the day the uk leaves .", 
                "the government may have shifted its thinking in response to the european parliament saying it will veto any brexit deal that prevents eu citizens who move to the uk during the next two years from having the same rights to live and work in britain as those already in the country .", 
                "he refused to back boris johnson 's claim that it would be perfectly ok '' to leave the eu without a deal .", 
                "asked about this , hammond said the government had plans for after we leave the eu in a huge variety of different , possible outcomes '' .", 
                "but he would not say he agreed with johnson .", 
                "he said that the government wanted to negotiate a deep and special relationship '' with the eu .", 
                "he said he was absolutely confident '' that the uk would get a deal and did not repeat may 's claim that leaving with no deal would be better than leaving with a bad deal .", 
                "he was not specifically asked about this , but he had the opportunity to make the no deal is better than a bad deal '' argument and it was noticeably absent from his rhetoric .", 
                "the interview appeared to confirm patrick wintour 's report yesterday about how the government is backing away from its threat to leave the eu without a deal .", 
                "he refused to back the conclusion of a house of lords report saying the uk would not have a legal obligation to pay anything to the eu after it left .", 
                "he implied that the government accepted it would have to pay something when it left .", 
                "asked if the lords report was wrong , he said : they have expressed some very important views and they have provided some analysis that will certainly inform the discussion that we are going to have .", 
                "it wo n't surprise you that our negotiating partners on the other side will have a different view and we will , as part of the negotiating process , the principles that will determine how we settle the rights and the obligations that we as a departing member have .", 
                "and we will go about that in a businesslike way .", 
                "but he also signalled that the uk would not pay anything like the \u00a3 50bn that the eu reportedly wants .", 
                "he said : but i shall be very clear that we simply do not recognise some of the very large numbers about that have been bandied about in brussels .", 
                "this figure was just a very aggressive '' staring point for the negotiation , he claimed .", 
                "this is , after all , a negotiation , and it is not at all surprising to me that our negotiating partners are setting out a very aggressive starting line for the discussion .", 
                "he said the article 50 letter would contain new information about the government 's negotiating plans .", 
                "of course it [ the letter ] will go further in expressing how we want to take the negotiation forward and how we see this negotiation developing .", 
                "he said the overwhelming majority '' of eu countries wanted a constructive '' approach to the brexit talks .", 
                "as we go into this process today , i believe that the overwhelming majority of our counterparts across the european union are approaching this on the basis that they want a sensible discussion , a constructive discussion , about a pragmatic future relationship with the united kingdom , a relationship that will strengthen the uk and will strengthen the european union as well .", 
                "and i 'm optimistic we can achieve that .",

                "i have not felt rather marginalised in recent weeks .", 
                "he said the decision to reverse the national insurance contributions rise in the budget was jointly taken by him and the prime minister .",
