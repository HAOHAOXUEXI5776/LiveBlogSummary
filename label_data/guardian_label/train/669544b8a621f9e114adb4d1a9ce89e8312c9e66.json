                "rod , excuse me , i 'm party leader , i expect you to come to my office \u0080\u00a6 last night paul karp reported that the coalition-dominated human rights committee , chaired by liberal mp ian goodenough , did not like its own policy for a lifetime refugee travel ban .", 
                "the coalition 's proposed lifetime refugee travel ban is a \u0080\u0098severe and exceptional ' measure and there is \u0080\u0098no suggestion ' refugees present a danger to australia , a parliamentary committee has said .", 
                "the parliamentary joint committee on human rights , chaired by liberal mp ian goodenough , said in a report released on tuesday the ban appeared to have a disproportionate effect on people of certain nationalities and could be discriminatory .", 
                "the travel ban was proposed by the coalition in october as a means to deter asylum seekers from coming to australia .", 
                "it would prevent refugees who were adults when sent for offshore processing on manus island and nauru from ever visiting australia , unless the immigration minister granted an exemption .", 
                "the committee concluded it was \u0080\u0098severe and exceptional ' to impose the ban because it applied to \u0080\u0098people who have committed no crime and are entitled as a matter of international law to seek asylum in australia ' .", 
                "goodenough has released a statement and i will have that to you shortly .", 
                "talk to me , send me tips , factchecks and thoughts in the thread , or via twitter @ twitterid or facebook .", 
                "mike bowers @ twitterid is in the building ."
