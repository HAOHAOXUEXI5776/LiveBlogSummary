                "second , when corporate tax is replaced by a still hypothetical but marginally more realistic flat rate income tax rather than a complete fantasy tax that has no impact on the economy the increase to australian incomes is less again : only $ 1.80 per dollar of revenue lost .",

                "many people would interpret the prime minister 's statement to compare the ultimate benefit per dollar of tax revenue given up in the shorter term .", 
                "on this basis , the increase to australian incomes in the long term is only $ 1.20 for every dollar given up in the short term as a result of corporate tax cuts .",
