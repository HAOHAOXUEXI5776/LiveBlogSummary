                "by contrast , pro-europeans like nick clegg ( see 2.18pm ) and lord mandelson ( see 2.49pm ) have said that his premature exit is a blow for the government and that it suggests ministers are having problems accepting unpalatable expert advice .", 
                "rogers has not said why he is quitting early but no one is challenging reports saying that he clashed with ministers who wanted him to be more positive about brexit .", 
                "there is nothing particularly unusual about governments wanting the top civil service jobs to go to people who are at least not hostile to their political aims and it is conceivable that a more pro-brexit replacement could help theresa may 's government get what it wants ( once it actually decides what it wants . )", 
                "but may can not take credit for forcing him out because his departure seems to have taken number 10 by surprise .", 
                "and it is also questionable whether there is anyone at all in the foreign office , or in the civil service generally , with the knowledge and experience to replace rogers who would be pro-brexit enough for the hardcore anti-europeans putting pressure on may .",

                "speaking on the word at one , he said that he and others in the vote leave campaign called for an open brexit .", 
                "but the government has taken the opposite approach , he claimed , citing as an example the conservative conference proposals ( since abandoned ) for firms to have to record the number of foreigners they employ .", 
                "hilton said : what i worry about is that the tone that theresa may has set so far is exactly the opposite of that [ open brexit ] , exactly what we do n't need ; a kind of closed brexit , a mean-spirited , narrow version of what leaving the eu should have been all about what theresa may is doing , certainly again in the tone that she and her ministers have struck , is to give the impression that the uk is pulling up the drawbridge , and instead of being open to the world , being closed to people .",
