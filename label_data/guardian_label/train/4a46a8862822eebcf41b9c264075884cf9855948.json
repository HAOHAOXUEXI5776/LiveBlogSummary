                "he defended plans to withdraw child benefit from parents whose children persistently truant .", 
                "as the press association reports , at present , non-payment of the \u00e2\u00a3 60 civil penalty in england for parents whose child misses school leads to it being doubled to \u00e2\u00a3 120 after 21 days and subject to prosecution after 28 , but 40 % still fail to pay and many do not end up in court because councils do not press legal action .", 
                "the government has announced plans to take unpaid fines directly out of child benefit .", 
                "explaining the measure , cameron said : the point about this is about children : we all know the evidence that if you do n't attend school regularly you get a less good education , you get worse results , as a result your job prospects are much much worse and as a result your life chances - the opportunities you have to make the most of your talents - are severely reduced .", 
                "that is why school attendance is so important .", 
                "these penalties are only imposed where someone has been fairly persistently truant and they ca n't resolve this issue with the school .", 
                "what we are saying today is where those fines are n't paid , they should be taken out of a parent 's child benefit to make sure the signal is absolutely clear that it 's your duty as a parent to get your children to school every day .", 
                "that is a very strong positive message to send out and i think on behalf of taxpayers who fund this child benefit , it is quite right to say to people : yes , child benefit is your right but with that right come some responsibilities .", 
                "he said corbyn 's policies were worrying and a threat to security .", 
                "asked about corbyn speaking at a protest meeting in manchester last night , he said : it is a free country ; he can go where he likes and say what he likes and i 'm not going to restrict his movements .", 
                "what is more worrying is what he is saying which is that he wants to put up taxes , which would wreck economic security , he wants to give up nuclear weapons , which would wreck our national security .",

                "asked about this , cameron said : that 's great that boris is coming up with good ideas and we are applying them in the rest of the country , and i dare say some of the ideas we are coming up with in the rest of the country , boris does in london .",
