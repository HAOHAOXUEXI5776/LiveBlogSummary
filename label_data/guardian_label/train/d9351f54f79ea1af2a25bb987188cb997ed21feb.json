                "the shares down 85 % this year slumped by 7.5 % .", 
                "mps is under instruction from the european central bank to bolster its finances after it was the weakest of 51 european banks subjected to stress tests .", 
                "the inability to convince qatar to put in up to \u0082\u00ac1bn is expected to lead the bank 's board to concede it would not be able to secure a solution to its capital gap without the italian government .", 
                "this means italy would have to impose losses on bondholders before it could stump up cash because of new eu rules intended to stop taxpayers having to up the bill for bank losses .", 
                "however , about \u0082\u00ac2bn of the bonds are held by private investors and there are expectations that an arrangement would be put in place to limit their losses .", 
                "the italian cabinet is expected to convene on thursday to discuss its options for protecting retail investors and to try to limit its eventual stake in the bank to below 50 % .",

                "paolo gentiloni has taken over as prime minister for now , but renzi is expected to run for election again as early as next year .",

                "but the issue could become politically toxic later , once it becomes clear how many of the bank 's junior bondholders are eventually compensated for their losses , and how long it takes for them to be paid piccoli said : in terms of the junior bondholders , let 's see what happens .", 
                "it will eventually be decided by brussels , once mps is saved , a number of other banks could also require government support , keeping the issue in the news for the foreseeable future .",
