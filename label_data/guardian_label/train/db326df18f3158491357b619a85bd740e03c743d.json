                "new zealand 's election campaign collided with the biggest questions of the internet age on monday - here 's how this remarkable day went down : documents provided by the whistleblower edward snowden reveal that the new zealand government worked to implement a secret mass surveillance program code-named speargun '' throughout 2012 and 2013 .", 
                "it followed an admission at the weekend by the new zealand prime minister , john key , that his government considered a mass-spying proposal after a series of cyber attacks .", 
                "key says the proposed surveillance made him uncomfortable '' and that he halted it in march 2013 .", 
                "edward snowden has weighed in , warning new zealanders that he was personally able to search their intercepted internet traffic while working as an nsa analyst in hawai'i .", 
                "if you live in new zealand , you are being watched , '' he wrote .", 
                "key responded by releasing his own declassified documents , which he says prove that no mass spying ever took place .", 
                "snowden has appeared via live stream at moment of truth , an internet party event at auckland town hall intended to publicise the speargun revelations .",
