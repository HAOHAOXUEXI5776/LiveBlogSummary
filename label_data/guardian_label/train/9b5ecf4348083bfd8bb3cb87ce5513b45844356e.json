                "we have recently put our property on the market with a fair market valuation , two viewings in 3 weeks and one has already expressed concerns around fracking even though they loved the property .", 
                "people in lancashire have genuine concerns around a process that is not properly regulated and we have a government who does not want to see any regulation to enable this untried industry to get on with it .", 
                "the uk may have onshore oil wells but they have not employed high volume hydraulic fracturing as is intended in lancashire .", 
                "it is also interesting that when , not that long ago , it was suggested there were large deposits of shale oil in the south east that it was quickly `` redacted '' to say that it would not be economically viable to pursue the recovery of these valuable deposits , strange how we in the north are expendable and the south east where a number of conservative ministers live will not be subjected to fracking .", 
                "those who are protesting are doing so not just to protect their rural community but the whole of lancashire and beyond , it could come to a field next to you in the future .", 
                "i like many of the others who have posted a comment get very worried when it is thought necessary to redact any report , they can not argue its in the interests of national security , more like a threat to the government 's plans .", 
                "if successive government 's had maintained investment in the nuclear industry we would not be in the position we are now with regards to energy supply , it 's easy for the pro frackers now when they can use the instability in russia and ukraine as the ideal reason why our area can be industrialised with well pads .", 
                "as for the comment that property values can go up and down , we all accept that when its market forces and it 's reflected across the uk but when a third party influence is the major factor then such a comment is very ill informed .", 
                "the government should publish this report in full and accept there may be consequences , not to do so suggests negative comment that can only do david cameron 's desire to push fracking through at all costs a great deal of harm ."
