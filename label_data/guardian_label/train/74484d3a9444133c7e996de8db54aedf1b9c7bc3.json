                "danuta h\u00fcbner , a polish mep , who chairs the european parliament 's constitutional affairs committee , argues it would be too late for british parliamentarians to have a meaningful say on the final treaty after october 2018 because formal negotiations would have already been completed .", 
                "eu negotiators have long said brexit negotiations must be completed by october 2018 to allow time for the ratification of the treaty before the uk 's departure day on 29 march 2019 .", 
                "asked if october 2018 was the final deadline to influence the agreement , h\u00fcbner told the guardian : once it is finalised and it is signed by both parties , then any change to it means reopening negotiations , meaning we will not make it within the two years [ the article 50 deadline ] , meaning there is a hard brexit .", 
                "stressing it was purely a british decision '' to decide how mps will have a say on the withdrawal agreement , she said even the smallest change to the treaty would mean resuming negotiations .", 
                "once anybody changes a comma or a dot or one-word , then there is no opinion , this has to go back to the negotiations .", 
                "the mep was speaking before last night 's dramatic vote in the house of commons , where mps voted for parliament to have a meaningful vote on the brexit deal .", 
                "the six-month window from october 2018-march 2019 is intended by the eu allow the treaty to be translated into the eu 's 24 official languages and scrutinised by committees in the european parliament , before the final plenary vote .", 
                "this view jars with the perception of some tory rebels , such as stephen hammond , who told bbc radio 4 on thursday : if [ the brexit deal ] is concluded by october next year , that gives six months if things go wrong . ''", 
                "the mp , who was sacked as a tory vice chairman overnight , also pointed to the flexibility in the article 50 process , which could give the uk a few extra weeks beyond departure day .", 
                "however , any extension would have to be approved unanimously by all 27 eu governments .", 
                "the european parliament will be asked to approve the article 50 treaty before march 2019 , but will be unable to make any changes .", 
                "h\u00fcbner , a member of the parliament 's brexit steering group , said meps were seeking to exert influence in other ways .", 
                "that is why we use a period of negotiation to influence the negotiations , to know what is in the mandate , to contribute to the result , but we can not amend [ the treaty ] because then it will be a never ending story ."

                "in the 19th century and earlier offenders could get locked up for this sort of behaviour .", 
                "today , if the commons passed a motion finding someone in contempt , that is normally the end of the matter , but for a minister it could , potentially , be career-ending .",

                "first , although the commons passed a binding motion saying the government should hand over its brexit impact assessment '' reports to the brexit committee , davis 's department did not hand over all the documentation it has , and the reports were not proper impact assessments .", 
                "davis said that that was because impact assessments as such did not exist .", 
                "the committee accepted this .", 
                "but that meant he was open to the second charge - that he and other ministers had effectively lied when they repeatedly told mps , in the chamber and in select committee hearings , that the government had compiled reports looking at the impact of brexit on sectors of the economy .", 
                "( david allen green has all the examples here , on his blog . )", 
                "john bercow ended up adjudicating because , if an mp wants to accuse another mp of contempt , they have to write to the speaker , and the speaker then decides whether to allow the commons to vote on the matter .", 
                "today bercow effectively ruled that , on both counts , davis was in the clear .", 
                "but on both counts bercow did make some criticisms of davis .", 
                "on the charge that davis did not comply with the commons motion , bercow said : while it was most regrettable that the secretary of state - a point i made to him privately but i now state publicly - unilaterally excised some material from the paper which he provided , and that it took so long to provide the papers , i also feel bound to pay due attention to the formally-recorded view of the committee that the secretary of state had complied with the order of 1 november .", 
                "and on the charge that davis and other brexit ministers repeatedly misled mps , by talking about brexit impact reports that did not actually exist , bercow said : ministers could , with advantage , have been considerably clearer in their statements , particularly challenging lines of questioning in select committees which were based upon a genuine misconception .", 
                "however , from the evidence which i have seen today date i have concluded that the test that i am bound to apply , that there is an arguable case that there has in this matter been a contempt of the house , has not been met in this case .",
