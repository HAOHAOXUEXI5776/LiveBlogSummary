                "jeremy corbyn has won a decisive victory in his second leadership contest , beating owen smith by a bigger margin than he had when he saw off three opponents in 2015 and thereby strengthening his grip on the party .", 
                "unlike a year ago , he won easily amongst party members ( as well as among registered supporters and affiliated supporters ) , confirming that the nature of the party membership has shifted quite considerably since the 2015 general election .", 
                "in a speech which conveyed notably more confidence and authority than the one he delivered after his victory last year , he appealed for unity , saying it was time to wipe the slate clean .", 
                "he also used a phrase , more in common , coined by jo cox , the labour mp killed in the summer who had been one of his critics .", 
                "he said : elections are passionate and partisan affairs things are often said in the heat of the debate on all sides that we later regret .", 
                "but always remember in our party , we have much more in common than that which divides us .", 
                "as far as i 'm concerned the slate is wiped clean from today .", 
                "we are proud as a party that we 're not afraid to discuss openly , to debate and disagree that is essential for a party that wants to change people 's lives for the better that is n't prepared to accept things as they are corbyn has said that lots of mps are now willing to support him ahead of compromise talks which may thrash out a deal that could lead to shadow ministers who resigned because they had lost confidence in corbyn agreeing to work for him again .", 
                "around 60 shadow ministers resigned over the summer ; a few have indicated publicly that they would be willing to return to the front bench , but many are still resisting .", 
                "the party 's national executive committee is meeting this evening to discuss the impasse .", 
                "corbyn wants the dissidents to return to the front bench so he can run an effective opposition in parliament .", 
                "his critics want him to agree to shadow cabinet elections .",

                "he told the delegates : under my leadership , the labour party has committed to consulting and working with women 's and other relevant organisations on how to strengthen the law and its implementation to tackle sexual harassment and threats online and increase organisations ' responsibility towards promoting safe and respectful \u0080\u0098community standards ' online \u0080\u0098reclaim the internet ' which many colleagues here today , including jess philips have been supporting brings together women 's campaigns , think tanks , trade unions and media platforms to challenge the abuse that women face online .",

                "at 11.45am the labour party will announce the result of its leadership contest at its conference in liverpool .", 
                "jeremy corbyn is widely expected to win and , as we reported in our overnight lead , insiders are predicting that he will get 65 % of the vote .", 
                "that would be an even bigger win than last year when corbyn got 59.5 % of first preference votes .", 
                "a result like this would be a big disappointment for owen smith , the former shadow work and pensions secretary who is challenging corbyn and who , at the very least , hoped to make a dent in corbyn 's lead .", 
                "last night corbyn issued a statement appealing for unity .", 
                "we must win the next general election so that labour can rebuild and transform britain so that no one and no community is left behind .", 
                "we can and must do that together .", 
                "that includes those who have voted , volunteered and campaigned for owen smith .", 
                "he also claimed that the election campaign had been overwhelmingly respectful in tone .", 
                "this summer , we have had a debate about the future of labour and the future of britain .", 
                "it has been robust , and at times difficult , but it has been overwhelmingly respectful in tone .", 
                "that will surprise many whose view of the contest has been shaped by the abusive debate on social media .", 
                "but just as david cameron once correctly said that twitter is not britain , twitter is not the labour party either and , as reports like this one in the london review of books and this one by the guardian 's ewen macaskill point out , the corbyn supporters attending events generally have nothing in common with the angry corbynites who have been spewing venom online .", 
                "( there has also been some online abuse from anti-corbynites , although generally it has been much harder to find . )", 
                "but nevertheless the division within the labour party is real quite possibly as deep as it has ever been and corbyn 's appeal for unity seems optimistic , to put it mildly .", 
                "that 's because labour increasingly looks like two parties : a leftist corbyn faction , which is taking over the party at grassroots level and which rejects much of what labour stood for when it was in office ; and a centrist , parliamentary faction dominated by the 75 % of mps who backed a motion of no confidence in corbyn because they think he is incapable of winning an election .", 
                "the centrists believe the corbynites are hopelessly naive , or even malign .", 
                "the corbynites think plp-led labour is discredited , reactionary , elitist and undemocratic .", 
                "a marriage guidance counsellor would have given up trying to reconcile these two ages ago , but britain 's first-past-the-post electoral system makes launching a new party pointless and and so these two tribes who despair of each other seem condemned to co-exist .", 
                "the result of the leadership contest will be announced during labour 's women 's conference .", 
                "the main conference opens tomorrow and will run until wednesday afternoon , when corbyn will close the conference with a speech .", 
                "inevitably the next five days will be dominated by reaction to corbyn 's likely re-election .", 
                "it has been said that the 60-odd frontbenchers who resigned over the summer because they lost confidence in corbyn face a choice of sulk or serve , and we will start to find out who intends to return to the front bench , and who intends to carry on refusing to cooperate with corbyn .", 
                "more generally , by wednesday we will know whether labour looks like a party that is beginning to reunite or the fractures are continuing to deepen .", 
                "i 'm in liverpool and i am just heading off towards the conference centre now .", 
                "i will post again around 9am .", 
                "if you want to follow or contact me on twitter , i 'm on @ twitterid .", 
                "i try to monitor the comments below the line but normally i find it impossible to read them all .", 
                "if you have a direct question , do include andrew in it somewhere and i 'm more likely to find it .", 
                "i do try to answer direct questions , although sometimes i miss them or do n't have time .", 
                "alternatively you could post a question to me on twitter ."
