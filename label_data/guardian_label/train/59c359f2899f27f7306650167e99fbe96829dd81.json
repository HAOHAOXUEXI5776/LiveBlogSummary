                "when it was put to johnson that the eu does not think those other means '' ( which the uk favours ) will work , he replied : we think that we can have very efficient facilitation systems to make sure that there 's no need for a hard border , excessive checks at the frontier between northern ireland and the republic .", 
                "for people listening , there 's no border between camden and westminster , but when i was mayor of london we anaesthetically and invisibly took hundreds of millions of pounds from the accounts of people travelling between those two boroughs without any need for border checks whatever .",
