                "alistair darling , the labour former chancellor and leader of the better together campaign , was on the andrew marr show too .", 
                "i summarised his interview very briefly at 9.31am , but it 's worth writing up in more detail , so here goes .", 
                "darling said that cameron would pay a very heavy price for years '' if he went back on his promise to give more powers to scotland .", 
                "trying to link that to limiting the voting rights of scottish mps was unacceptable , he said .", 
                "the agreement reached by the three parties , as far as i 'm concerned , is non-negotiable .", 
                "it was promised , it 's got to be delivered , and anyone who welches on that will pay a very heavy price for years to come .", 
                "it is simply non-negotiable the debate in scotland is altogether more advanced and more developed than it is in other parts of the uk because we 've had a referendum campaign .", 
                "i quite accept there is , alongside that but separate from it , a bigger issue about what constitutional reform is needed , but what i 'm very clear about is the agreement , the binding commitments given in relation to scotland are non-negotiable .", 
                "or put it another way - if anyone attempts to get out of that , how will anyone be believed on anything they 've got to say ?", 
                "that is simply non-negotiable , i 'm very , very clear about that .", 
                "he said the scottish referendum should settle the independence issue for a generation .", 
                "we 've settled it - we 've had the referendum that people did n't think would ever take place ; a massive turnout , which speaks volumes , but it 's been decided now for a generation , and by a generation i mean many , many years to come .", 
                "he said he did not believe the yougov poll putting the yes camp ahead .", 
                "i 've been involved in election campaigns for over 30 years , and i know that when you go around the supermarket and people , when they move away from you and are rather embarrassed to have you in the same supermarket as they are , you 've got a problem , but this was n't happening .", 
                "people were coming up and - sometimes quietly - saying 'i 'm on your side ' .", 
                "it was a very odd thing .", 
                "what i 'll tell you that poll did do , though , is it galvanised our support , because when it appeared , far from heads going down , heads went up , and you got people who had said nothing , for whatever reason , they said 'i 'm not going to let this happen to my country ' .", 
                "so it 's one of these things - a well-disguised blessing .", 
                "he said he had not yet decided whether to stand for parliament again .", 
                "i 've got a bigger decision to make in the next couple of weeks or so as to whether or not i stand again as an mp and i 've got to make that decision fairly quickly , but whatever i do , inside or outside parliament , i 'm not a spectator by nature .",
