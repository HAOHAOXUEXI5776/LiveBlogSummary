                "our welfare bill is too high as a country .", 
                "we face enormous economic challenges in the world and we ca n't as a country afford to have a very large working-age welfare bill .", 
                "there is speculation that the big announcement expected in his speech will be about further welfare cuts .", 
                "he said the state should not be paying for young people to spend their life on the dole .", 
                "we 've got to stop paying for a young generation to spend a life on the dole when we should be equipping them with apprenticeships and training to make the most of life .", 
                "this was a defence of the plan announced yesterday to fund more apprenticeships by cutting the welfare cap .", 
                "he said ed miliband 's claim that the link between living standards and the state of the national economy has broken was a dangerous myth .", 
                "i totally reject this fallacy , which is repeated by labour politicians , sometimes dare i say it aired on this programme , that the link between the national economy and people 's personal economies is fundamentally broken .", 
                "you tell that to th many tens of thousands of people who lost their jobs when the economy crashed six or seven years ago .", 
                "you tell that to people who as a result of the great recession are much poorer and whose opportunities in life have been curbed because of the failure of economic policy so i do n't accept that the link has been broken .", 
                "i think it is a dangerous myth .", 
                "it is put about by people who basically would trash the economy again and say do n't worry , because it is not going to affect you .", 
                "i 'm afraid people would bitterly live to regret that .", 
                "this was in some ways the most interesting thing osborne said all morning , although not the most newsworthy .", 
                "osborne is a politician with a serious interest in ideas , and here , for the first time , he was using a new argument to take a central plank , perhaps the central plank , of milibandism .", 
                "ed miliband thinks the economy needs to be restructured because the link between personal well-being and economic growth has broken .", 
                "in the past , when the economy grew , take-home pay in real terms went up too , but for the last 10 years or so it has n't .", 
                "osborne took this on ; but he did so , essentially , by twisting miliband 's argument , and implying that miliband was arguing that the state of the economy does n't matter ( which is not what miliband has been saying at all . )", 
                "he confirmed that conservative backbenchers will be free to campaign for britain to leave the eu in the proposed eu referendum .", 
                "he sidestepped a question about whether he could imagine circumstances in which it would be good for britain to leave the eu .",

                "for the first time in my lifetime , the march of the separatists in scotland has been reversed .", 
                "this is highly questionable , to say the least .", 
                "he said he would urge people considering voting ukip to remember that the general election essentially amounts to a choice between cameron and miliband .", 
                "you can either have ed miliband and no plan for the economy , or david cameron and a plan for the economy that is working .", 
                "and that is , in the end , the only two outcomes of the general election .", 
                "the more people focus on that choice , the more people visualise downing street and who is going to walk through the door after that general election , the more people realise that it is the conservative party who offer a brighter future for our country .",
