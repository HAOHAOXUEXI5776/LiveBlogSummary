                "hello and welcome to our rolling coverage of the 2016 primary election , the day after barack obama literally dropped the mic on republicans , democrats and the press , and only two days out from the crucial indiana primary , which is likely the last realistic chance to block a former reality tv star from a clear path to his party 's nomination .", 
                "donald trump needs 1,237 delegates to clinch the republican nomination at the party 's convention in july , and party leaders in new hampshire and elsewhere are trying to pack their contingents with anti-trump republicans .", 
                "trump 's main rival , texas senator ted cruz , has meanwhile invested huge efforts into indiana , a state with politics so conservative that its voters may yet choose the widely loathed senator over the nationally disliked businessman .", 
                "trump did not attend the white house correspondents dinner on saturday night , although he 's been a guest before .", 
                "obama .", 
                "/ barcroft images is this dinner too tacky for the donald ?",

                "is he at home eating a trump steak , tweeting out insults to angela merkel ?", 
                "what 's he doing ?", 
                "polls suggest the race is close : cruz 's well-organized team has tended to over-perform in states such as indiana , and the state 's rules mean whoever wins takes most of the delegates .", 
                "cruz himself will appear on nearly every sunday talk show this morning to press his case that somehow he can be both america 's most conservative leader and a unifying , definitely-not-despised-by-colleagues force in american politics .", 
                "the texas senator was not spared obama 's mockery , especially for his talk of a basketball ring earlier this week .", 
                "what else is in his lexicon ?",

                "football hats ?", 
                "but , sure , i 'm the foreign one .", 
                "cruz is also hampered by john kasich , a third republican candidate who trails by a huge margin in the race and who has lured more moderate conservatives to his comparatively more moderate cause .", 
                "without any realistic chance at the nomination , kasich has largely been ignored by party leaders such as former house speaker john boehner and senator lindsey graham .", 
                "this week boehner called cruz lucifer in the flesh .", 
                "tkt on the democratic side of the race , underdog bernie sanders has lost nearly any mathematical chance at the nomination in terms of pledged and unpledged delegates .", 
                "he has vowed to continue the race through its final stages , however , and already turned toward converting his remarkable success he often notes that he started a year ago at 3 % in the polls into a progressive agenda for the democratic party at large .", 
                "obama joked that the 74-year-old sanders is the bright new face of the democratic party .", 
                "i am hurt , though , bernie , that you 've been distancing yourself a little from me .", 
                "i mean , that 's just not something that you do to your comrade .",

                "that frontrunner , former secretary of state hillary clinton , has already turned her attention away from sanders and toward trump and the general election .", 
                "clinton has given a rare exclusive interview to cnn this morning , and will likely have to field questions about her thoughts on a potential running mate , even though the party remains months from the convention .", 
                "obama did n't spare his erstwhile cabinet member from a little teasing , and alluded to her hard road ahead uniting sanders ' passionate base of young people .", 
                "you 've got to admit it though , hillary trying to appeal to young voters is a little bit like your relative who just signed up for facebook .", 
                "obama out , the president declared on saturday night , at ease with his nearing departure from the white house .", 
                "we 're in it for the long haul , so follow along to see how trump , cruz , sanders and clinton try to edge each other , redefine politics and react to the presidential gibes at their expense .",
