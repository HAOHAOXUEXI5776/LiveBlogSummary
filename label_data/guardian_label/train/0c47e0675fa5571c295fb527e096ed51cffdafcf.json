                "the president once a poor fit at this mecca for traditional american conservatism seems likely to be received with open arms on friday , judging by the people we spoke to here on thursday .", 
                "cpac attendees say trump is doing 'good job ' while others are still in shock read more whatever ideological differences they may once have had with him , and whatever doubts about his conservative bona fides they may still have , attendees in the main seem delighted that their team is now back in charge of the white house and congress after eight years they regard as a disaster .",

                "attendees bounded down the hallways donning trump 's signature red make america great again hats , flitting between discussions often framed around what they dubbed a campaign by the dishonest media to discredit trump and his administration .", 
                "richard barrett , a 21-year-old student who identified himself as an early trump supporter , said he felt vindicated by the pro-trump tone that dominated cpac 's first full day .", 
                "i was here last year , and this convention was pretty anti-trump , barrett said .", 
                "it was really funny , because everybody here was \u0080\u0098never trump ' ; [ they said ] he 's never going to win the primary , it 's going to be ted cruz all the way . '",

                "yesterday the main event for many was a rare public sighting of steve bannon , seen by many as the power behind the throne and the engine of trump 's ideology , which he described as economic nationalism .", 
                "bannon and his white house colleague reince priebus , who comes from the establishment wing of the party , put on a show of unity .", 
                "but although priebus , a former party chair , listed trump 's policy priorities and made it clear he was committed to trying to deliver them , it was the former breitbart boss bannon who seemed to truly embody the worldview of the trump white house .", 
                "and his fury at the media , which he calls the opposition party , was never far from the surface .", 
                "if you think they 're going to give you your country back without a fight , you 're sadly mistaken , he said of the media .",

                "that is the promise of donald trump .", 
                "media coverage of the trump administration would never improve , bannon claimed , because the corporatist , globalist nature of the media meant it was intrinsically opposed to the new president 's policies .", 
                "vice-president mike pence and controversial white house aide kellyanne conway also spoke .", 
                "steve bannon : trump is 'maniacally focused ' on executing promises read more trump is due to speak today at about 10am et the white house says 10am , the agenda says 10.20am .", 
                "he 'll be followed later on by two other political figures who have found themselves making a sudden move from the fringes to the mainstream over the last year : national rifle association chief wayne lapierre and uk brexit leader nigel farage .",
