                "several political parties will be involved in the campaign to keep britain in the european union .", 
                "there are at least three cross-party umbrella groups but labour , mindful of how campaigning alongside the conservatives in better together in scotland backfired badly on the party at the 2015 general election , has got its own campaign , labour in for britain , and its chair , alan johnson , was on the today programme this morning .", 
                "having multiple parties campaigning for the same thing can be an advantage , because they appeal to different groups .", 
                "but it also has its drawbacks , because campaigners may contradict each other , and we saw that today when johnson shot down one of david cameron 's key eu arguments .", 
                "here are the key points from the interview .", 
                "johnson said that cutting in-work benefits for eu migrants would not reduce immigration .", 
                "cameron has repeatedly argued that in-work benefits are one of the pull '' factors that lure eu migrants to the uk ( even though the evidence for this is minimal , to put it politely ) , and he has been talking up the significance of the emergency brake '' that would allow the uk to stop paying full in-work benefits to eu migrants for up to four years .", 
                "but johnson said this would have no impact on immigration .", 
                "asked if it would deter people from coming to the uk , he replied : it was never going to do that the issue of in-work benefits is n't a draw factor and indeed this is a two-way process , no country has more of its people working in other developed countries than britain - more than poland , more than any other country in europe .", 
                "go to a pub in paris , go to a pub in madrid you will hear english voices .", 
                "it 's not a draw for them , either , there 's all kinds of factors why people choose to move around the european union to work .", 
                "i do n't think that 's one of them .", 
                "but johnson also said that labour supported the principle behind the emergency brake '' on fairness grounds .", 
                "he said : we believe in the principal of fair contribution , that 's why it was in our manifesto that there should be a limit of two years before in-work benefits were paid .", 
                "actually there is an argument that this is better in the sense that you 're here contributing paying taxes for a period before you actually receive those benefits .", 
                "and i think for british people the problem is not xenophobia , it 's not anti-europe , it 's not any kind of racism overt or covert , it 's a fairness argument .", 
                "it 's that you should be putting something into the system before you draw anything out .", 
                "he said that pro-europeans had not been making the case for the eu strongly enough in recent years .", 
                "i do n't think many people , including me , have been making that argument sufficiently overt the last ten years .", 
                "now we can do it in areas where ukip are strong and areas where they are not .", 
                "there is more europe coming later today .", 
                "here is the agenda for the day .", 
                "10am : the supporting syria conference opens in london .", 
                "my colleague matthew weaver is covering that on a separate live blog .", 
                "syrian donor conference : cameron pledges to double aid - live updates read more 11am : david davis , the conservative mp , gives a speech on what leaving the eu would mean for the uk .", 
                "around 12pm : mps begin a debate on a backbench motion saying the eu renegotiation should protect parliamentary sovereignty .", 
                "as usual , i will be covering breaking all the political news as it happens , as well as bringing you the best reaction , comment and analysis from the web .", 
                "i will post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon .", 
                "if you want to follow me or contact me on twitter , i 'm on @ andrewsparrow .", 
                "i try to monitor the comments btl but normally i find it impossible to read them all .", 
                "if you have a direct question , do include andrew '' in it somewhere and i 'm more likely to find it .", 
                "i do try to answer direct questions , although sometimes i miss them or do n't have time .", 
                "alternatively you could post a question to me on twitter ."
