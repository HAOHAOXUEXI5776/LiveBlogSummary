                "there are going to be endless labour leadership hustings over the summer and , if you are already fed up with andy burnham 's tale about the man voting ukip because he was the only person on his shift who spoke english , you had better get used to it .", 
                "there was no obvious winner tonight , but the two candidates with most reason to be pleased are jeremy corbyn ( because he has a distinctive message which many people seem to like ) and yvette cooper ( because she projected confidence and experience , and used her own experience well to defend labour 's line on benefits ) .", 
                "andy burnham was less sure-footed ( he is getting mocked on twitter for his party comes first '' answer ) , and liz kendall was the most direct on economic competence , but she did not sound like someone easily winning over the audience .", 
                "one problem is that the audience in the hall is not the same as the electorate in the leadership contest .", 
                "the questioners in nuneaton were pushing the candidates to the right , but most of them will probably not be voting in the leadership contest .", 
                "storywise , one line stood out .", 
                "liz kendall explicitly committed herself to allowing the labour party to hold an election to replace her if she was under-performing as leader .", 
                "she has hinted at this before , but tonight she was explicit .", 
                "asked if she would resign if it looked as though labour was going to lose under her leadership , she replied : yes , because more than anything i want labour to win so we can change the country there are some mps who are talking about having a new process whereby if colleagues think you are not doing well enough you can go .", 
                "i have to go through that as a local labour mp .", 
                "we should have that for the labour leadership too because above all we can not put our values into practice unless we win .", 
                "some figures in the party , like lady royall , the former labour leader in the lords , or alastair campbell , have been calling for the introduction of this kind of break clause '' into the party rules .", 
                "but , as a move to boost her chances in the contest , kendall 's declaration was blunted by the other candidates giving some support to the idea .", 
                "corbyn said there should be a return to the situation where the party leader is elected annually .", 
                "burnham said he would stand down if he was damaging the party , and he said the party rules already allowed leaders to be replaced .", 
                "( they do , but it is not at all easy , and that procedure never gets used . )", 
                "cooper said the same , and made it clear she was not advocating a rule change .", 
                "she said : the last people who should be deciding what are the rules for this leadership contest are the people who are standing in the leadership contest .", 
                "we should follow the rules that the party sets out .", 
                "that 's all from me .",
