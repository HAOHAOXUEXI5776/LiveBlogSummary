                "the argument i and others made has not won the day .", 
                "but it will need to be discussed again because , how can i put it , i 've seen the perils of the past of putting something which you know in your heart of hearts is not necessarily deliverable .", 
                "clegg has revealed that the liberal democrats would raise capital gains tax for the wealthiest in order to pay for an increase in the personal allowance to \u00a3 11,000 in the first year of a new parliament .",

                "he proded the party towards voting for the amendment ( which , as duncan brack explained , would have overturned existing policy ) , but he did no more than that .",

                "so why did clegg want to drop the party 's opposition to expansion at gatwick ?",
