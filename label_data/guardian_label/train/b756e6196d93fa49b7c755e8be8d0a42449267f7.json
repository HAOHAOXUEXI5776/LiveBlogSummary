                "this wo n't necessarily win him the election , but he took a risk deciding to take part , and it did not go wrong .", 
                "david cameron 's refusal to turn up was demeaning , but he is probably right in thinking that most voters wo n't bother with such media processology and he has managed to get the media talking , yet again , about the prospect of labour governing with the support of the snp .", 
                "even though miliband faced sturgeon down on this about as robustly as he could , the prospect of labour governing with snp votes does seem to alarm some english voters , which is why the tories are campaigning on this so strongly .",

                "she is also a remarkably good debater , and it showed again tonight .",

                "natalie bennett came top on one twitter sentiment analysis , and performed quite strongly overall , and yet she failed to make the impact some might have expected when the greens were polling at their peak a few months ago .",
