                "but he added : it is highly unlikely that the g20 finance ministers will be able to deliver on anything more substantial than mere warm words and empty rhetoric , though i 'm sure uk officials will somehow be able to shoehorn a mention into the statement about the risks of a brexit '' as project fear '' continues to get ramped up by the various vested interests in the global economy as well as big business .",
