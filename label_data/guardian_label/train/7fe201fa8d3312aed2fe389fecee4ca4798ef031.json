                "the office for budget responsibility the uk 's fiscal watchdog said another recession was inevitable at some point and that theresa may 's failure to win a parliamentary majority in last month 's election had left the public finances more vulnerable to being blown off course than they were in 2007 .", 
                "in its first in-depth analysis of the fiscal risks facing britain , the obr said its main message was clear : governments should expect nasty fiscal surprises from time to time because policy can only reduce risks , not eliminate them and plan accordingly .", 
                "and they have to do so in the context of ongoing pressures that are likely to weigh on receipts and drive up spending and a variety of risks that governments choose to expose themselves to for policy reasons .",

                "but it noted that even a small fall in britain 's underlying growth rate after departure from the eu would lead to a big increase in the country 's debt burden .", 
                "if gdp and receipts grew just 0.1 percentage points more slowly than projected over the next 50 years , but spending growth was unchanged , the debt-to-gdp would end up around 50 percentage points higher , the obr said .",
