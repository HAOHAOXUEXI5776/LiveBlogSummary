                "indeed , our forecast that sterling will fall to $ 1.30 is partly based on a view that a further decline in the uk 's currency is needed in order to rebalance her economy there is another key reason why we expect sterling to lose more ground against the dollar , which is the relative prospects for monetary policy in the uk and us the risk of a brexit could make the bank of england disinclined to begin to tighten monetary policy before the referendum and we think it is likely to tread cautiously thereafter .",
