                "there 's been considerable discussion about the labor/green alliance , that particular hung parliament scenario , but far less focus on a minority parliament with the coalition in command , because by and large the prime minister has been able to hide successfully behind his slogan ( and that 's all it is ) that only the coalition will deliver stable government .",

                "turnbull has gone to the polls this time with the intent of seeking a mandate not only for the coalition for a second term , but for himself as prime minister .", 
                "on day one of this campaign turnbull told voters i am seeking a mandate .", 
                "that was n't of course an accident .",

                "but abbott 's appearance on the bolt program on sky news suggests to me that conservatives are positioning for a number of win/loss/draw scenarios .",

                "the strength of the conservative faction 's position post-election relates directly to the outcome on 2 july , which brings me back to where i started with this thought exercise : if it is to be a coalition victory , then the size of the victory matters to malcolm turnbull .", 
                "one more point before we move into the day .", 
                "on q & a earlier this week , malcolm turnbull , again anticipating any number of scenarios , was at pains to say he was not a dictator but first among equals at the cabinet table .", 
                "some colleagues have been distinctly nonplussed by the campaign focus on turnbull at the expense of the party as a whole all the presidential branding , the focus on the attributes of the candidate rather than the strength of the party as an institution , and turnbull , for all his discipline over the past seven weeks , has displayed a couple of pure malcolm moments : agreeing the colonisation of australia was an invasion , moving out of polite neutrality on the plebiscite on same-sex marriage ( that was not my idea , it was what i inherited , but in any case , i 'll be voting yes and speaking for the yes case ) .", 
                "the plebiscite really exposes the irreconcilable differences between liberals and conservatives in the coalition , which have n't gone away , and will roll on into the new term .",

                "the group stood in a circle by candlelight and listened to readings , including sections of her maiden speech .", 
                "after that , attendees shared their thoughts and feelings about cox 's life and death .", 
                "the organiser of the sydney event , neva frecheville , said she had felt the need to bring together people who knew cox or who were moved by her .", 
                "when it happened it was just something that i feel like has the potential to make us all feel really isolated and full of despair and without hope , she said .", 
                "but actually there 's an opportunity for us to come together around everything that jo stood for in her life , and the values that she lived her life by .", 
                "i think it 's time for more of us to start living those as well .",

                "we just by chance happened to pull up next door to their home their boat , he said .", 
                "we 'd invite them over , and we went over to their place .", 
                "we had a lot of barbecues and a really good time .", 
                "like frecheville , seton wanted to see the good that could come out of what he said was a devastating tragedy .", 
                "i feel like the silver lining really is that people have recognised that the values that she had and are really seeking to fulfil it themselves , he said .", 
                "jane mcadam , a law professor at the university of new south wales , said she knew cox 's husband , brendan cox , and attended partly because of that connection .", 
                "but i think more broadly it was what jo devoted her life to in upholding the principles that she thought were so important in trying to create a society that was connected and not divided , she said ."
