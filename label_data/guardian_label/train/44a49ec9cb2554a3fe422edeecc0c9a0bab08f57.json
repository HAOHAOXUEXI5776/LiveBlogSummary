                "mps were presented with two different views of dominic chappell , but neither inspired confidence that he should have ever owned bhs .", 
                "the man himself admitted not paying enough attention to bhs 's pension problems , a mistake that had terrible consequences for the company 's current and former workers .",

                "that gamble did n't pay off , and bhs 's 11,000 staff are paying the price .", 
                "and as mps away at the property sales at the heart of the bhs deal , a curious slowly emerged about how chappell 's retail acquisitions ( ral ) ever looked like a credible bidder .", 
                "it all centres on an aborted plan to sell marylebone house , generating a nice profit for ral , and helping funding the deal .",

                "graham ruddick ( @ grahamtruddick ) dellal-green-ral dealings hugely important , because without it dominic chappell put no money into bhs so , a buyer without retail experience and without the funding needed to turn bhs around .", 
                "we also learned : chappell admitted he had made a profit from bhs , but refused to reveal how much and claimed he deserved it .", 
                "retail acquisitions took \u00e2\u00a3 17m at least from bhs , but chappell refused to confirm how much went to him personally .",

                "chappell blamed tax bills , citing profits he made at bhs .",
