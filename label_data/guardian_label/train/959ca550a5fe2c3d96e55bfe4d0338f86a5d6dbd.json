                "to underline the point , here are five things you can learn about coalition government from the book .", 
                "1 - coalition government leads to westminster conventions being rewritten .", 
                "over the years the palace of westminster has accumulated , almost silted up within its walls , a mass of procedure and convention .",

                "the procedure is laid down in the massive 1,089-page volume of 'erskine may ' but the convention is not written down anywhere .",

                "( alexander was setting a precedent for minor party coalition ministers making their own party political finance statements from the despatch box . )", 
                "what makes this insight particularly important is the prospect of more convention-busting after 7 may .", 
                "for example ; i have already heard experts suggesting that a minority government could actually lose a vote on the queen 's speech without having to resign .",
