                "labour has accused iain duncan smith , the work and pensions secretary , of yet again postponing his target date for the full roll-out of universal credit .",

                "but , at the bottom of a news release issued today , the department for work and pensions says only that the bulk '' of the roll-out will be completed by 2019 .", 
                "reeves said : [ this ] just confirms that universal credit is rolling out at a glacial pace .", 
                "it 's just another example of tory welfare waste .",

                "so is today 's semi-statement merely more porkie pies in the sky ?", 
                "duncan smith defended his approach , saying that he deliberately wanted to roll the programme out carefully to allow time for mistakes to be ironed out .", 
                "jeremy hunt , the health secretary , has told mps that he is one of those people who have visited a & e rather than wait for an appointment with a gp .", 
                "speaking in the commons at health questions he agreed with a tory mp who said patients wanted more flexibility .", 
                "he went on : i 've taken my own children to an a & e department at the weekend precisely because i did n't want to wait until later on to take them to see a gp and i think we have to recognise that society is changing and people do n't always know whether the care that they need is urgent or whether it is an emergency , and making gps available at weekends will relieve a lot of pressure in a & e departments .", 
                "stephen dorrell , the conservative former health secretary and former chair of the commons health committee , has announced that he is standing down at the election to take up a job as a health consultant with kpmg .",
