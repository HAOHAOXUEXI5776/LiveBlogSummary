                "the london borough of camden said it would immediately remove cladding from five tower blocks in the borough because it is similar to that which burned rapidly on grenfell tower .", 
                "following independent testing of cladding on the chalcots estate by the building research establishment , the council leader , georgia gould , revealed the outer cladding panels on the blocks were also made up of aluminium panels with a polyethylene core .", 
                "until the cladding is removed the council pledged round-the-clock fire safety patrols on the estate 's corridors to reassure residents and carry out enhanced fire safety checks .", 
                "the panels that were fitted were not to the standard that we had commissioned , said gould .", 
                "in light of this , we will be informing the contractor that we will be taking urgent legal advice .", 
                "she continued : camden council has decided it will immediately begin preparing to remove these external cladding panels from the five tower blocks on the chalcots estate .", 
                "camden council will do whatever it takes to ensure our residents are reassured about the safety of their homes .", 
                "however , the council said the insulation used significantly differs from that on grenfell tower because it includes fire-resistant rock wool insulation designed to prevent the spread of fire and fire-resistant sealant between floors , designed to stop a high-intensity flat fire from spreading to neighbouring flats .", 
                "the council said this arrangement previously contained a fire at a flat in taplow block in 2012 .", 
                "meanwhile barnet council has written to residents in three towers which inspections on monday revealed were clad in the same aluminium sandwich panels that are believed to have been used at grenfell .", 
                "granville point , harpenmead point and templemead point all use the reynobond pe panels aluminium panels with a polyethylene core which were supplied to the grenfell tower refurbishment project .", 
                "the council has sought to reassure residents that while the panels are the same , crucially it uses different insulation materials , which are made from a non-combustible mineral fibre material .", 
                "the council leader , richard cornelius , said : to ensure such a tragedy is not repeated in barnet , we have a responsibility to our community to make sure that safety systems are of the highest standard including investigating whether sprinklers would be appropriate in our high-rise tower blocks .", 
                "we will be calling on our housing committee to oversee a programme of investment , based on advice from the london fire brigade , to provide added safety and reassurance to our residents .",
