                "ian paisley , the democratic unionist party mp , has launched a scathing attack on the irish government branding its call for northern ireland to remain in the customs union and single market as disgraceful '' .", 
                "he said they were happy to take \u00a3 7bn bailout during the financial crisis in 2010 from britain and need to act as good neighbours and as friends '' instead of undermining '' relations .", 
                "speaking at the northern ireland affairs select committee in westminster on wednesday , he said if ireland continued to propose divergence between the region and the rest of the united kingdom , they should be punished '' with a long , tenuous and hard '' negotiation on a fisheries deal post brexit .", 
                "he said : frankly i think the pussy footing needs to stop i think our neighbour has acted disgracefully .", 
                "they are supposed to be our partner .", 
                "as a nation our majesty 's government since 2016 has given them billions of money interest free to bail them out of economic ruin and bankruptcy .", 
                "of course that money has been paid back but paid back at a very generous rate the republic of ireland relies for a major part of its trade with uk its fisheries water becomes our fisheries water in 2019 and as early as september 2019 they will need to make a fisheries deal , not with the eu , but with us and frankly if they continue to exacerbate our will as citizens of the uk , i think we should make that fisheries deal , long tenuous and hard for them .", 
                "the dup is implacably opposed to anything that will separate them from the rest of the uk .", 
                "last week the party , which holds the balance of power at westminster , said it will use its parliamentary muscle to prevent any special post-brexit deal for northern ireland that could decouple '' the region from the rest of the uk .", 
                "paisley told the committee people were exasperated '' with the dublin government .", 
                "addressing the ministers giving evidence to the committee , he said : i think that message needs to be spelt out that they need to start acting in a mature way and dealing with us as good neighbours and as friends instead of trying to frustrate the will of the people of the uk by saying they want a united ireland , by saying they want this part of the sovereign territory , that this part of her majesty 's kingdom , to be out with the rest of the agreement .", 
                "if her majesty 's government is n't for diplomatic reasons prepared to say it publicly , i hope you are starting to shake their cage internally and privately in these negotiations .", 
                "a lot of people are really exasperated with the amateurishness of the irish government ."
