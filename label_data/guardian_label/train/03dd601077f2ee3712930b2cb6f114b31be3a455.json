                "meanwhile , the initial uncertainty following a victory for trump would surely undermine the prices of industrial commodities , including oil and base metals , while gold would benefit from a renewed burst of safe-haven demand .", 
                "in the short term , therefore , we would expect crude oil to fall to around $ 40 and gold to surge to at least $ 1,400 .",
