                "a version of this theory was floated in the sun on sunday just over a week ago , when it claimed that blairites were helping corbyn get on the ballot to handicap andy burnham ( the current favourite ) by splitting the leftwing vote .", 
                "but this scenario does not really stack up , for various reasons .",

            "text": [
                "here are the main points from the today interview with jim murphy , the former scottish labour leader .", 
                "murphy said the voters were right to reject labour at the election .", 
                "this came when he explained what labour needed to do to win back power .", 
                "he said : we have to be able to say by voting for our party , here is how we can help go on that journey [ to a better future ] .", 
                "and , unfortunately in the general election , not enough people north or south of the border believed that the labour party had the answers to that test .", 
                "when asked if voters were right to come to that conclusion , he replied : the voters are never wrong .", 
                "he said the election had killed the idea that labour could win power just by attracting lib dem votes .", 
                "[ there was ] this idea that somehow magically in the country there was this coalition of labour voters and disgruntled liberals that would get us over finishing line .", 
                "i never shared that view .", 
                "i always had a sense that we had to try and build a bigger tent , and a politics that appealed to one nation conservatives and those who have been previously anxious about labour , in the way that tony blair and others have done in the past .", 
                "one of the tiny silver linings of a very dark cloud of labour 's defeat is that it 's now a statistical truism that labour has to pitch a tent that says yes to our core voters , but also has to reach out to moderate , one nation conservatives in building a coalition .", 
                "because if we try and build a coalition of labour , traditional labour and disgruntled liberals next time round , it will end the same way as it has done in may .", 
                "he said that the reforms he introduced to scottish labour ( principally , a one member one vote system for leadership elections ) would end the boss politics '' that gave union leaders too much power .", 
                "as i left the leadership of the labour party in scotland , i wanted to make sure that we modernised the party and bring an end to the boss politics of the trade union leaderships who behaved , in the past , as though they owned the membership 's vote .", 
                "he said labour suffered a catastrophic defeat '' in england and scotland , and now needed a fundamental rethink .", 
                "he said labour lost two and a half elections .", 
                "it was defeated by the snp in scotland and by the tories in england and it lost ground to ukip .", 
                "i do n't want a leadership contest for the uk leadership of the party that is somehow trapped in a mindset of one more heave .", 
                "this was a catastrophic defeat north and south of the border and we need as deep thinking in england as we 've started now in scotland .", 
                "if we do in the next five years is similar to what we 've done in the previous five years , then we face real difficulties .", 
                "he said labour could now move on from the era of blairite/brownite divisions .", 
                "one of the things we can do , at least , is put the old enmities of the blair/brown divisions beyond use once and for all .", 
                "he obviously did not read the telegraph this morning .", 
                "see 9.47am .", 
                "he said the labour leadership candidates had all made a good start '' in addressing the party 's problems , but added : there 's a long way for them still to go . ''", 
                "he said he would not be publicly endorsing any of the candidates in the uk leadership contest or the scottish leadership contest .", 
                "he said his friend david miliband had never said anything to him suggesting he wants to return to british politics .", 
                "he 's got a big job and the job that he has at the moment ; trying to rescue refugees from nations and strife all across the world , already is a remarkably important thing to do .", 
                "if he wants to change his mind about that , that 's really for him to announce that .", 
                "but nothing that i have heard in my private discussions with david has ever suggested that he is tempted to come back into the frontline of british politics .", 
                "he said during the election the snp benefited from a post-truth '' culture in politics .", 
                "when i was doing those tv debates it sometimes felt like i was up against a quasi-religious rock concert , where no matter what truth you told it did n't really matter in a post-truth type of argument in politics .",
