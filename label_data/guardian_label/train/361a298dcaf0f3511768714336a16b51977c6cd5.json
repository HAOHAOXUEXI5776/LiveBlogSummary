                "but he would not back a french-style burqa ban , he said .", 
                "going for the french approach of banning an item of clothing , i do not think that 's the way we do things in this country and i do not think that would help .",

                "then he went on : if it is necessary to do that again , in more detail , to make it even clearer to people that our parliament is sovereign asked if he thought it was necessary , he replied : i think there is a good case for it so we will look very carefully at that .",
