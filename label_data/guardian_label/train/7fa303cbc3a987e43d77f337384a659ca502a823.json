                "the snp has gone much further , with a full raid on the westminster hyperbole cupboard and a press notice laden with words like humiliated '' and meltdown '' .", 
                "in truth , the vote itself does n't really matter , because labour forced a vote on a procedural matter which would never normally merit a proper division anyway .", 
                "but the debate itself was revealing , because it showed that , while some tories are merrily embracing the government 's english votes for english laws ( evel ) plans , others are expressing quite serious reservations about them .", 
                "one of the most telling moments came when the debate was over , and david davis rose to make a point of order about how more time needed to be set aside for these matters to be debated .", 
                "it sounded relatively innocuous , but davis is one of westminster 's inveterate plotters , and he does n't do innocuous .",

                "some of the critical tories were simply asking for more time .", 
                "but the more time mps get to debate the changes , and the more opportunities they get to vote on amendments to the bill ( see 2.32pm ) , the more chance there is that the government will be defeated , or forced to compromise , on aspects of its plans .", 
                "here are the key points .", 
                "several tory mps complained that the government was trying to rush its evel plans through the commons .", 
                "sir edward leigh said that the uk hangs by a thread '' and that the future of the union was at stake '' and that the government had o be seen to be doing this in a very fair way '' .", 
                "like david davis , leigh appealed for extra time , and peter bone even floated that idea of letting the commons sit through the night to ensure the plans got proper scrutiny .", 
                "dominic grieve , the former attorney general , made a similar point .", 
                "we certainly should n't seek to underestimate the enormity of that change , it is a very profound change and it needs to be properly debated .", 
                "i have to say that at the moment i have serious anxieties that there is time available to carry out that scrutiny .", 
                "grieve even suggested britain might now need a written constitution .", 
                "with all the changes taken place , the unwritten constitution was being stretched too far , he suggested .",

                "grayling said that mps would be able to vote on more than one amendment to the plans .",

                "i believe this is the real driver behind these changes and it makes the outrageous procedural fix of using standing orders rather than legislation to produce the change even more unacceptable .",

                "speaking from the backbenches , the former labour leader said : i think doing this procedure , in the way it 's being proposed , is frankly an act of constitutional vandalism .",
