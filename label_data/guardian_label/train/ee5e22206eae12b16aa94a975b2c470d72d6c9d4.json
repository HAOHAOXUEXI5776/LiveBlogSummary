                "oscar pistorius must be found guilty of the premeditated murder of his girlfriend reeva steenkamp , south african prosecutors have said , as the athlete 's testimony was dismissed as mendacious and devoid of truth .", 
                "prosecutor gerrie nel , making his closing argument for the state , said the defence claim that pistorius believed there was an intruder in his house on the night of 14 february 2013 would not help him escape conviction : i know there is a human being behind that door .", 
                "i mean to kill that person and i do so .", 
                "that it turned out to be reeva is [ legally ] of no consequence .",

                "at the high court in pretoria , nel repeatedly accused pistorius of tailoring his evidence , saying that contested claims about the location of a duvet and two fans in the athlete 's bedroom and inconsistencies in his version of events on the night were the consequence of a snowball effect of lies .", 
                "the court should have no difficulty in rejecting his full version of events , not only as not reasonably possibly true , but in essence as being absolutely devoid of any truth , nel told the court .",

                "the state says the four shots were fired at 3.17am ; the defence says this noise was the cricket bat breaking down the toilet door , and earlier sounds heard by neighbours were the shots .", 
                "the state has not provided an alternative explanation for the earlier noises , but its argument that neighbours heard female screams rests on the fatal shots being fired no earlier than 3.17am .",
