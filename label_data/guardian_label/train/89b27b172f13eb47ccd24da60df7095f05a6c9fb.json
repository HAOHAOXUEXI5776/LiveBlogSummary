                "that 's a good development and gives us reason to hope . ''", 
                "thomsen cautioned , though , that the two sides are still far from the target '' .", 
                "valerio nicolardi ( @ valerionicolard ) `` talks with greece have gained momentum but still long way from target - imf '' - over the weekend , ecb chief mario draghi and us treasury secretary both warned that the situation now was now urgent '' .",

                "deputy pm yiannis dragasakis said yesterday that athen would not budge from our red lines . ''",
