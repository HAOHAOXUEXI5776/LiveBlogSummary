                "households can expect to see the cost of a basket of regular purchases rise by an average of around 2.7 % as a result of the fall in the pound after the referendum vote for brexit , a thinktank has forecast .", 
                "as the press association reports , the institute for fiscal studies ( ifs ) predicted that the 12 % collapse in the value of sterling since june will drive up the cost of running a vehicle - including petrol - by 5.1 % , clothes and footwear by 3.1 % and food by 2.9 % .",

                "the speech is about the supreme court and the constitution .", 
                "hale says there is a limit to what she can say on the article 50 case , because the supreme court will hear the appeal , but she does include this paragraph , suggesting she thinks there is case for saying the government would have to repeal the entire european communities act , not just pass a short bill , to be able to trigger article 50 .", 
                "article 50 of the treaty of the european union provides that 'any member state may decide to withdraw from the union in accordance with its own constitutional arrangements ' ( article 50 ( 1 ) ) .", 
                "a member state which decides to withdraw shall notify the european council of its intention .",

                "however , the treaties shall cease to apply to the state in question from the date of the entry into force of that agreement or , failing that , two years after the notification , unless the council unanimously agrees to extend the period ( article 50 ( 3 ) ) .", 
                "the issue is whether giving that notification falls within the prerogative powers of the crown in the conduct of foreign relations or whether it falls foul of the rule that the prerogative can not be used in such a way as to frustrate or substantially undermine an act of the united kingdom parliament .",

                "such a result , it is said , can only be achieved by an act of parliament .",

                "it would probably be unwise to read too much into this , but a shock ruling from the supreme court saying the government had to repeal the eca before it could trigger article 50 - and that would be a seismic shock - would delay brexit by months , or even years .", 
                "that is because repealing the eca will require complicated legislation and there is no chance of getting it through parliament by the end of march , theresa may 's deadline for triggering article 50 ."
