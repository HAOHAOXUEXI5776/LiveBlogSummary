                "brown joked earlier about not being very good with statistics ( see 1.03pm ) , but that has n't stopped him overloading the speech with them .", 
                "there are countless passages where fine writing is hobbled and swamped by an overload of numerical facts .", 
                "but it is worth ( just ) getting past them because as well as containing the well-trailed attack on george osborne , the speech offers a wide-ranging analysis covering the historical nature of poverty , and how changes to the labour market have affected it .", 
                "here is the key news line .", 
                "brown said that unless osborne completely abandoned his tax credit cuts , he would push child poverty to its highest level for 50 years .", 
                "cutting tax credits was a mistake as profound as the poll tax , he said .", 
                "even a phased in or watered down version of tax credit cuts will condemn britain to higher levels of child poverty than at any time in fifty years and what is 'government induced poverty ' will leave us a more divided , more polarised , harsher , 'two nations ' britain , inequality set to rise faster than anywhere in the world .", 
                "because the tory analysis is so fundamentally wrong , a mistake on a par with the poll tax and far worse than the bedroom tax - the impact of the cuts can not be massaged or phased as if we can soften the blow : even a modified version will destroy jobs , stunt children 's development and impoverish hard working families marginal changes that massage the cuts will not work : root and branch surgery on the proposals is required .", 
                "there will be under the conservatives more child poverty now than in the thatcher years , creating a britain more divided , more stratified , more polarised and more segregated , in which the advances made in thirteen years of labour government are to be reversed in just five years from now to 2020 .", 
                "the two nations disraeli feared are now not only with us : over the next five years , we will see each of the nations driven further apart from each other .",

                "1 - most poor people are lazy '' .", 
                "in fact , brown said , most people living in poverty are living in working households .", 
                "while , according to one opinion poll , people believe 40 per cent of the welfare state budget goes to those registered unemployed , it is only 1.5 per cent ( and even if we include disabled and single parents who stay at home to bring up their children it is only 8 per cent ) .", 
                "2 - most children who are poor are poor because their parents do n't want to work '' .", 
                "in fact , brown said , poor children are much more likely than not to be living in working households .", 
                "an astonishing high number of poor british children - two out of every three - live in a family where at least one adult works .", 
                "indeed , 75 per cent of these children are in working families where the main breadwinner works all the hours he or she can .", 
                "3 - 'people are poor because they live chaotic lives . ''", 
                "in fact , brown said , the biggest group of families in poverty are traditional '' families .", 
                "the biggest group of families in poverty is the country 's traditional families - working single earner couples - with the father at work , mother at home doing unpaid work bringing up their children in the home .", 
                "4 - globalisation allows young people to escape poverty . ''", 
                "in fact , brown said , millennials '' are the new poor .", 
                "the new face of twenty first century poverty , the new poverty generation are the millennials - young people in their twenties , including young couples whose income from work is low and stagnating when their rents and living costs are so high - who fall into poverty when they have children even if you are young , aspirational and hard-working , with a get-up-and-go attitude , you will not necessarily get on in today 's tory britain .", 
                "5 - child benefit encourages people to have children '' .", 
                "in fact , brown said , child benefit only covers a small part of the cost of having a child , and is becoming considerably less generous .", 
                "child benefit which paid for 26 per cent of a first child 's essentials in 2010 will cover 19 per cent in 2020 .", 
                "for the second child the respective figures are 18 per cent falling to just 13.5 per cent .", 
                "quite simply , child benefit in itself can not contribute enough to the costs of a child and is probably worth only half of what it was originally intended britain 's own new two child policy - cutting children 's benefit off after the second child - is of course different from china 's .", 
                "in china all families are hit equally : in britain it is the already poor who are hit further .", 
                "6 - people get stuck with low pay because they do not try hard enough to get better jobs . ''", 
                "in fact , brown said , the problem with low pay was structural , not cyclical ; there has been a permanent shift to a low-wage economy .", 
                "the problem that britain has more low paid jobs proportionately than most advanced countries - is not a temporary , post-recession , cyclical problem but more akin a long-term structural problem rooted in the decline of manufacturing and heavy industries , the exposure of the british economy to global competition and the scale of technological change which has destroyed or deskilled thousands of jobs instead many of the low paid - half of them are in social care , retail or hospitality - want to work longer hours to make ends meet but no matter how much they want to do so they can not .", 
                "7 - increasing the minimum wage will make up for the tax credit cuts . ''", 
                "it wo n't , said brown .", 
                "no matter how generous a minimum or even living wage is , it has to be complemented by tax and benefit support if we are not to leave millions of working families in poverty it was not an accident that the minimum wage and tax credits were introduced together .", 
                "if tax credits had been introduced without the minimum wage , then we would indeed have been subsidising employers to pay their workers less .", 
                "but a minimum wage without tax credits can not take full account of the family circumstances and in particular the needs of children .", 
                "8 - one group pays money into the welfare state and another group takes money out of it . ''", 
                "in fact , said brown , we all benefit from welfare spending some of the time .", 
                "from time to time , almost every family depends on the welfare state and that we are not a nation permanently divided between the contributors and the claimants or as tory propaganda 'strivers and skivers ' .",

                "it is headlined the case for a stronger united nations to protect and keep the peace '' , but really it is about the case for liberal interventionism .", 
                "benn is strongly in favour , and it is hard to see anything in the speech that tony blair ( the high priest of liberal interventionism ) would disagree with , although benn does not mention iraq at all .", 
                "and benn does not specifically address what should happen in syria , although it does reinforce the case he made in his speech to the labour conference tentatively backing air strikes in syria on humanitarian grounds .", 
                "benn 's conference speech was denounced by the stop the war coalition ( until recently chaired by jeremy corbyn ) and the labour conference later passed a motion saying the party would only back action in syria with un approval .", 
                "significantly , benn argues to today that un approval should not always be required before military intervention takes place on humanitarian grounds .", 
                "here are the key points from the speech .", 
                "benn said that concerns about national sovereignty should no longer be used as an argument against military intervention on humanitarian grounds .", 
                "one of the problems we face is national sovereignty .", 
                "a country invading another is one thing , but when terrible events happen within a country some still say that this is an internal matter and none of anyone else 's business .", 
                "we used to hold the same view of domestic violence here in the uk .", 
                "forty or fifty years ago , if the police were called because of reports that a man was beating up someone in the street , he would be swiftly arrested .", 
                "but if the victim was his wife or his partner behind a closed front door , then the prevailing attitude was 'it 's a domestic dispute and not for us to get involved . '", 
                "that does n't happen anymore .", 
                "a crime is a crime , and the sovereign state of the kitchen or the bedroom no longer provides any protection against enforcement of the law .", 
                "i think we are currently witnessing the world going through exactly the same process internationally for exactly the same reason .", 
                "an increasing number of voices are saying that leaving people by the roadside of conflict to fend for themselves simply can not be right .", 
                "and so was born the concept of responsibility to protect - the idea that the international community does have a responsibility to stop people becoming victims of the most terrible crimes .", 
                "benn devoted much of the speech to saying there were moral and practical reasons for intervening to protect those affected by a conflict like the one in syria .", 
                "he also quoted the parable of the good samaritan as an example of why it was right to intervene to help he said that although military intervention should be approved by the un security council , he did not think un approval was always necessary .", 
                "we see from history that the un has not always been capable of agreeing on what should be done or of acting effectively when it has .", 
                "we have to accept that the veto exists to bind the world 's major powers - the five permanent members of the security council - into the united nations , but with it comes a great responsibility .", 
                "that is why the french government has proposed that in cases of mass atrocities permanent members of the security council would voluntarily agree not to use their veto .", 
                "i think this is an important proposal and it should be strongly supported by the uk and others .", 
                "but what if the un will not or can not act - then what ?", 
                "is that an argument for standing on one side ?", 
                "not in all cases some would argue , including me , as our support for intervention in sierra leone and kosovo demonstrated .", 
                "others , however , take the view that in the absence of a un mandate there can be no legitimacy for any action .", 
                "he said britain should be playing a much bigger role in un peace-keeping operations .", 
                "at present there are close to 125,000 military and civilian un peacekeepers compared with only 11,000 a quarter of a century ago .", 
                "despite this , there still are n't enough for all the missions the un would wish to run , and to the high standards we expect of them .", 
                "for as well as numbers , there is also the question of training , equipment , and capacity , particularly as regional institutions build their own peacekeeping .", 
                "this is an area in which britain could and should play a much bigger part given the skill , experience and expertise of our armed forces .", 
                "there are currently just under 300 british peacekeepers contributing to un missions although another 300 are soon to deploy to south sudan and somalia .",
