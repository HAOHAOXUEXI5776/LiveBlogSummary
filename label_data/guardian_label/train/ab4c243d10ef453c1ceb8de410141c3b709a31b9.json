                "lewis points out that beijing 's attempts to rebalance its economy away from manufacturing and into consumption will inevitably hurt growth : it should be no surprise that a rapidly growing industrial economy such as china 's is drifting into choppy financial waters .", 
                "the advanced economies faced similar challenges at corresponding stages in their development .", 
                "but , in coping with the consequences of financial turbulence , the advanced economies often suffered significant losses of output relative to potential .", 
                "the beijing authorities are professedly seeking to change china 's economic growth model from one which depends on exports and capital investment to one more firmly based on domestic consumption .", 
                "but they may be over-estimating the extent to which politicians can choose how their economies grow .", 
                "since curbing growth in some sectors is usually easier than boosting it in others , the danger is that the attempt to re-orient the economy will result in overall weaker growth this is one reason , which seems to be widely acknowledged , why china 's future growth could well fall short not only of recent rates but even of the beijing authorities ' more conservative projections for the years to come .", 
                "then there are the demographic problems , which prompted the abolition of the one child per family rule : by 2050 , those aged 65 or over could well stand at 38 % of the labour force , slightly less favourable even than japan 's present ratio .", 
                "there could be ameliorating circumstances for china .",

                "further , china would perhaps be less opposed on cultural grounds than japan to immigrant labour , though there have been no moves in that direction yet .", 
                "indeed , the ruling communist party 's highly developed sense of self-preservation might be expected to resist any disturbance of the status quo .", 
                "at the same time , in the nearer term , china faces a unique problem , the result of the recent abandonment of the one-child policy in favour of a two-child policy .", 
                "to the extent that this measure is effective in raising the birth rate , it will temporarily boost the dependency ratio , that is , the proportion that the non-working population , old and young , bears to those of working age .",

                "beyond the north korean danger , both the east china sea and the south china sea are possible flashpoints .", 
                "in the former area , there was a stand-off between japan and china over the senkaku ( diaoyu ) islands through most of last year .", 
                "but on 20 december an armed chinese coast-guard vessel entered territorial waters that japan claims around the islands .", 
                "in response to these and other regional tensions , the japanese government has proposed for the fiscal 2016/17 year a 1.5 % increase in military spending to a highest-ever level .", 
                "this is significant in view of the pressure to achieve reductions in other spending programmes .", 
                "the japanese government had been allowed , under the nation 's post-war constitution , the right of self-defence , which would have covered operations around the senkaku islands , but mr abe nevertheless pressed for , and in september secured , an amendment that would allow japan to afford military help to allies .", 
                "this strongly suggests that the abe government foresees the possibility of japan taking part in the resistance to what several nations in the region regard as beijing 's aggressive strategy in the south china sea .", 
                "it seems a long time since the spratly islands first hit the headlines .", 
                "it was as long ago as 1999 that a filipino naval ship deliberately ran aground on one of those islands to establish a claim to the archipelago .", 
                "last year , in a dramatic development , it became clear that china was determinedly seeking to enforce its own title to the area when it built an artificial island on the foundation of the mischief reef and went on to claim , in contravention of un rules , territorial waters around that construction .", 
                "the us navy has since sought to enforce freedom of the seas by disregarding china 's pretensions , thereby precipitating low-level exchanges with china 's ships .",

                "in an ominous development , its government announced on 23 december that it would be taking delivery from russia of two more kilo-class submarines to supplement the four it already deploys .", 
                "these vessels are reckoned to be especially effective in relatively shallow waters ( the iranian navy has three of them ) .",
