                "karim said that , although eric pickles ' letter ( see 9.32am ) was written with a constructive intent , pickles was wrong to imply that muslims could be held responsible for extremism .", 
                "most of the letter is actually very constructive .", 
                "however , it is rather unfortunate that an underlying message which , i do n't think was the intention to convey , but it certainly has been put out in a way that you are looking to try and place a responsibility on a section of our community that it is impossible for them to fulfil .", 
                "and , equally , you are in many ways holding that section of our responsible for matters that actually are well beyond their control .", 
                "he said pickles 's suggestion that islam was a new part of the british identity was ill-informed because he has forgotten how important islam , hinduism and sikhism were to subject of the british empire .", 
                "[ faith in islam ] is part of british identity .", 
                "in fact , this is not something that is new .", 
                "this is something that has been part of the british identity for many centuries .", 
                "certainly , when one looks at the history of the indian sub-continent , you will find that the concept of britishness , as it then was , with subjects , incorporated many , many millions of people with faiths including hinduism , islam , and many hundreds of thousands of followers of sikhism as well .", 
                "and so , therefore , to try and portray today that somehow islam is a new part of the concept of britishness in itself , i 'm afraid , is quite an ill-informed basis upon which to try and communicate with a section of our society .",
