                "if the goal is a genuine blue-collar conservatism , it must be a priority for the autumn statement and spending review to ease a policy which could otherwise do the same kind of political damage as labour 's abolition of the 10 per cent income tax band .", 
                "in this section of the interview david cameron was reminiscent of gordon brown in 2008 refusing to accept that low-paid workers were losing out from the abolition of the 10p starting rate of tax .",

                "david cameron will this week become the first conservative leader to address his conference as prime minister of conservative-only government since john major in 1996 .", 
                "that was a gathering with less cheer than a funeral .", 
                "in manchester the mood will be very different and , with the lib dems near extinct and labour veering left under jeremy corbyn , perhaps the biggest challenge for the torries will be containing their triumphalism although , as ever with this party , the split over europe threatens to disrupt proceedings .", 
                "here are some of the main news developments overnight .", 
                "george osborne has announced that the government will allow working grandparents to share the parental leave allowance .", 
                "this is very similar to an idea contained in labour 's 2015 election manifesto .", 
                "tim shipman in the sunday times ( paywall ) says at least 18 ministers and former ministers are thinking of standing against george osborne for the conservative leadership when david cameron stands down .", 
                "cameron 's decision to pre-announce his departure has turned this week 's conference into a leadership beauty contest .", 
                "theresa may , sajid javid , jeremy hunt , chris grayling , graham brady , liz truss , andrea leadsom , justine greening , dominic raab , stephen crabb , anna soubry , penny mordaunt and priti patel have all discussed with friends the prospect of running .", 
                "former cabinet ministers owen paterson and liam fox are also considering whether to anoint a new right-wing standard bearer with grayling expected to resign from the cabinet over europe and lead the charge or run themselves .", 
                "the jostling for position began in earnest last night when may , the home secretary , slapped down nicky morgan , the education secretary , who last week sought to usurp her as the leading female challenger to osborne .", 
                "in an interview with the sunday times , may said it was not the time to talk about the leadership , and candidates should only cross that bridge when we come to it .", 
                "asked if she agreed with morgan that there should be a woman leader , may said : the people of this country voted david cameron back in as prime minister and he 's going to be serving a full second term .", 
                "we have a first-class prime minister .", 
                "cameron has told the sunday telegraph in an interview that he will give more resources to the sas and double the number of british drones as part of the fight against islamic state .", 
                "nick sutton ( @ suttonnick ) sunday telegraph : sas 'beefed up ' to take fight to isil the dream of a nation is over # rwc2015 # tomorrowspaperstoday cameron has hinted in an interview in the sun that he could lead the campaign for britain to leave the eu if he fails to get the reforms he wants in his renegotiation .", 
                "but , as sunder katwala points out , the paper in its editorial says this is a bluff .", 
                "sunder katwala ( @ sundersays ) pm tells sun on sunday `` he 'll rule nothing out '' on eu - but paper 's editorial does n't believe him : `` that 's a bluff '' tim shipman in the sunday times ( paywall ) says cameron faces two new challenges over europe this week .", 
                "david cameron is facing a showdown with eu judges and his party on europe this week , amid claims he has privately pledged not to pull britain out of the eu .", 
                "the european court of justice ( ecj ) will deliver a ruling on tuesday that could force britain to give prisoners the right to vote in european elections .", 
                "it would be a blow to the prime minister , who has previously called the idea sickening , as he prepares to give his speech to the tory party conference .", 
                "later this week the no campaign to leave the eu will be launched , unveiling a list of tory donors who have defied pleas from lord feldman , the tory party chairman , not to campaign against cameron .", 
                "nick sutton ( @ suttonnick ) sunday times front page : cameron hit by double blow on eu # tomorrowspaperstoday # bbcpapers tim ross in the sunday telegraph says the tories will announce plans to spend \u00e2\u00a3 250,000 on bursaries to help more low-income people stand as candidates for the party .",
