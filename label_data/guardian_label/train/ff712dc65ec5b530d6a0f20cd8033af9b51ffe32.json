                "so the question then becomes : \u0080\u0098why go down the path that actually pushes us into the position where we actually give this risk a chance of materialising ? '",

                "now you can write it off by extending maturities and pretending you are not really writing it down because you are not changing the face value but we all know what 's really happening in economic terms .",

                "the imf 's message here is , i think , long overdue essentially european policymakers either want to force greece out of the euro and take the risk , which , as simon says , we really can not quantify very sensibly or they are going to have to recognise economic reality , if they want greece to stay in the euro , an economic reality that is saying significant write-off in some form or other [ will be needed ] ."
