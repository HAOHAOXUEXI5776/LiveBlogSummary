                "i think it will signal a much wider rewiring of the governance and constitutional arrangements in the country as a whole , particularly governance within england which remains an unusually over-centralised country the next parliament will be of huge constitutional significance , starting of course with this significant transfer of very considerable further powers to holyrood .",
