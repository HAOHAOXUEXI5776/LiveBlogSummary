                "osborne claimed he could not have discussed hsbc 's involvement in tax dodging in switzerland with the former hsbc boss lord green when he was a tory trade minister because osborne did not know then about the evidence suggesting the bank colluded with this .",

                "the new information is that , potentially , the allegation is that hsbc swiss colluded in this - this is new information .", 
                "he said he was aware , when green was appointed , that some of hsbc 's swiss customers were being investigated for tax evasion .", 
                "but those were individual matters , not corporate matters , and it would not have been right for him to ask about tax investigations affecting individuals .", 
                "but osborne at times sounded evasive when asked about what he discussed with green , and labour 's margaret hodge has accused him of not telling the full truth about his knowledge of affairs at hsbc .", 
                "see 8.52am .", 
                "osborne said that hsbc was a very important bank '' for the uk , employing 50,000 people , and that he wanted it to succeed .", 
                "he confirmed that he was considering toughening the law on tax dodging .", 
                "he said he supported tory plans to retain cutting net migration below 100,000 a year as an ambition '' .",

                "he said the ifs report today on living standards marked a major milestone today in the british recovery , with incomes back to where they were before the crisis '' .",

                "and they also say that , rather than inequality increase which , again , is often said , in fact , inequality has fallen in our country .", 
                "he said the sale of the government 's stake in eurostar for \u00a3 750m was good value for money for the taxpayer '' .",
