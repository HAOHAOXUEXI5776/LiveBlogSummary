                "it is slightly problematic that some elements of his speech are likely to be seen as short-term political expediency , and could create uncertainty for business which runs counter to the need for long-term strategic vision and investment .",

                "snap verdict : after his brilliant speech to the 2012 democratic convention bill clinton explained its success by saying that explanation is eloquence '' and it seems that ed miliband was trying to take this advice on board in a speech with a strong , explanatory spine .", 
                "unusually for a party conference speech , it had a coherent , logical structure , and it was light on oratorical flourishes .", 
                "the together '' line might stick , but otherwise it was hard to think of a memorable phrase .", 
                "all this made it admirably serious .", 
                "but - let 's be honest - it was also a bit tedious .", 
                "miliband may have suffered , too , from the fact that his big nhs announcement came out early ( not intentionally ) , and his endless references to gareth , colin etc make the speech ripe for parody .", 
                "earlier this year miliband claimed that empathy was a key quality for a leader , and these real people '' anecdotes collectively reinforced the impression that he 's a good listener .", 
                "but this was probably overdone , and if i were david cameron 's speechwriter , i would already be working up a passage for cameron 's conference speech about how labour policy is now being decided , not by the leader , or the shadow cabinet , but by whichever stranger miliband happens to meet in his local park .",

                "it 's the highlight of the week at manchester , ed miliband 's last speech to a labour conference before the general election , and any readers of the rightwing papers today will be absolutely baffled as to what he stands for .", 
                "the sun headlines its story red ed 's 10 yr plan '' and it says that , by outlining a six-point plan , miliband is conjuring up communist party imagery of the five-year plans used by chinese communist leader mao tse-tung and russian tyrant joseph stalin '' .", 
                "but if you read the print edition of the daily telegraph , it will tell you miliband is emulating a different political icon .", 
                "miliband echoes maggie with homes pledge , '' says the headline above a story saying that miliband 's plan to double the number of first-time buyers by 2025 shows a thatcherite commitment to home ownership .", 
                "as usual , it 's best to read the guardian to find out what 's really going on .", 
                "like most other papers , we report that miliband plans to use money from the mansion tax to raise more money for the nhs .", 
                "but patrick wintour also reveals that miliband is also going to propose a windfall tax on the profits of tobacco companies to help fund the nhs .", 
                "here 's how his story starts .", 
                "ed miliband is to put the nation 's health at the centre of a 10-year plan for britain 's future on tuesday , backing the nhs with funding from a novel windfall tax on the profits of uk tobacco companies and the proceeds of a mansion tax on homes worth more than \u00a3 2m .", 
                "in his final labour party conference speech before next year 's general election , miliband will tell sceptical voters he can bring the country back together and offer six ambitious goals , including changes to the nhs , designed to overcome the greatest challenges of our age and transform the ethics of how britain is run '' over the next decade .", 
                "the nhs is generally acknowledged to be facing a growing funding crisis after four years of tight settlements , deepening demographic pressure and an inefficient system that splits health and social care .", 
                "the nuffield trust has suggested there will be a financial shortfall of \u00a3 2bn in 2015-16 .", 
                "overall miliband 's performance as a party leader has been patchy but he has excelled at giving conference speeches .", 
                "often these events attract a flurry of interest on the day , only to be completely forgotten seven days later .", 
                "but for the last three years - predator capitalism in 2011 , one nation labour in 2013 , and the energy price freeze in 2014 - miliband has been able to pull off agenda-setting speeches that last .", 
                "today we 'll see if he can do it again .", 
                "here 's the agenda for the day 9.40am : conference opens with nec reports .", 
                "10.05am : mohammad taj , the incoming tuc president , speaks .",
