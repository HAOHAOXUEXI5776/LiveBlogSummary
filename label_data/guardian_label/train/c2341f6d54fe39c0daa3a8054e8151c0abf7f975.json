                "it was not a particularly remarkable speech , but it was noteworthy what he chose to stress : the economy ( employment , lower taxes , the national living wage etc ) and progressive , social justice measures ( like increasing the aid budget , adoption reform and the national citizen service ) .", 
                "there was not anything very party political in it ( unsurprisingly ) and there was only a brief reference to the issue that brought about his resignation , the eu referendum and brexit .", 
                "cameron fought the 2010 general election committed to creating the big society but over the next few years this was abandoned as a priority , partly because of austerity and partly because it turned out to be a vision with little electoral appeal .", 
                "cameron , though , never entirely gave up his belief in this vision and , although this speech did not contain what was once his catchphrase , it did end with a passage praising volunteers for making our society bigger and stronger and insisting that the spirit of service is one of this country 's most remarkable qualities .",

                "above all it was about turning around the economy and with the deficit cut by two-thirds , two and a half million more people in work and 1m more businesses , there can be no doubt that our economy is immeasurably stronger .", 
                "politicians like to talk about policies but in the end it is about people 's lives .",

                "i think of the hardworking families paying lower taxes and getting higher wages because of the first ever national living wage .", 
                "i think of the children who were languishing in the care system , and who have now been adopted by loving families .", 
                "i think of the parents now able to send their children to good and outstanding schools , including free schools that simply did n't exist before .", 
                "i think of over 200,000 young people who have taken part in national citizen service , the fastest growing youth programme of its kind in the world , something that again was n't there six years ago .", 
                "i think of the couples who have been able to get married who were n't allowed to in the past .", 
                "and i think of the people on the other side of the world who would n't have had clean drinking water , the chance to go to school or even be alive were it not for our decision to keep our aid promises to the poorest people and the poorest countries in our world .", 
                "and we have used our stronger economy to invest in our health service .",

                "i am delighted that for the second time in british history the new prime minister will be a woman and once again a conservative .",

                "but as prime minister you see it so directly that it blows you away .", 
                "and of course writing those heart-breaking letters to the families who have lost loved ones is a poignant reminder of the profound scale of what these men and women give for us in the defence of our freedoms and our way of life .", 
                "we must never forget that .", 
                "in a different way , i have seen that same spirit of service in the amazing contributions of countless volunteers in communities up and down our country who are making our society bigger and stronger .", 
                "and i am proud that every day for the past two years i have used the office of prime minister in a non-political way to recognise and thank almost 600 of them as points of light whose service can be an inspiration to us all .", 
                "for me , politics has always been about public service in the national interest .", 
                "it is simple to say but often hard to do .", 
                "but one of the things that sustains you in this job is the sense that , yes , our politics is full of argument and debate , and it can get quite heated , but no matter how difficult the decisions are , there is a great sense of british fair play , a quiet but prevailing sense that most people wish their prime minister well and want them to stick at it and get on with the job .", 
                "so i want to take this moment to say thank you to all those who have written letters and emails offering me that support , people who i will never get to meet and never get to thank personally .",
