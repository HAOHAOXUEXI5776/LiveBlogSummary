                "here are the main points from the fabian conference so far .", 
                "jeremy corbyn has announced that labour would take care homes that are going bust into public ownership to protect residents .", 
                "he made the announcement in a keynote speech to the fabian society conference in which he said labour was committed to giving social care the funding it needs '' .", 
                "his speech did not say how much this proposals might cost , or how it might be funded .", 
                "( i 've asked his press officers about this , but so far have not had any reply .", 
                "i will update later if i get one . )", 
                "corbyn 's speech came as sarah wollaston , the conservative mp who chairs the commons health committee , floated the idea of raising national insurance by 1 % to fund social care .", 
                "( see 10.14am . )", 
                "update : labour sources are saying that the proposal to take failing care homes into public ownership could be effectively self-financing '' .", 
                "some care homes are already paid by the state to lease buildings , and in those cases payments could just continue , a source indicated .", 
                "in other cases , where care firms own property outright , the buildings could be purchased using money set aside for capital spending .", 
                "this would be cheaper than building a new home from scratch , the source said .", 
                "but he also said labour 's current demand was for the government to find money for the system now by cancelling planned corporation tax cuts and other tax cuts for the rich .", 
                "corbyn has accused theresa may of being in denial '' about conditions in the nhs .", 
                "she should listen to real doctors not spin doctors , he said .", 
                "he was responding to the news that downing street appears to be partially blaming some gps for problems affecting a & e services .", 
                "( see 11.05am . )", 
                "corbyn has said that labour would offer a complete break with this rigged system '' .", 
                "( see 8.46am . )", 
                "his speech used the word rigged '' in relation to the system , the economy or rules etc ten times and it confirms that he is determined to portray himself as an anti-establishment insurgent .", 
                "according to briefing from his team corbyn wants to learn some lessons from donald trump 's electoral success and this was perhaps evident in the speech where corbyn made a virtue of taunting one of the newspapers hostile to him , the daily telegraph .", 
                "( see 10.42am . )", 
                "the speech was one of the most polished and well-crafted he has delivered as labour leader , something being attributed to the influence of his new speechwriter , the former deputy prime minister 's son david prescott .", 
                "corbyn argued that people voted for brexit because they felt they were being ignored .", 
                "( see 10.47am . )", 
                "theresa may makes almost exactly the same argument .", 
                "ironically on this point may agrees with corbyn but not her chancellor , philip hammond , who uses an interview with this week 's economist to say that he does not accept the may ( and corbyn ) analysis .", 
                "here 's an extract from the economist 's bagehot column .", 
                "in a speech on january 8th [ may ] argued that the brexit vote was about much more than eu membership : it was a rejection of laissez-faire liberalism '' .", 
                "mr hammond recognises no such crux : where 's the evidence for the assertion that the brexit vote was saying something about this or that or the other ?", 
                "it was saying something about britain 's membership of the european union . ''", 
                "corbyn said that , if he became prime minister , dealing with the housing crisis would be his top priority .", 
                "during the q & a he revealed that he had said this during a visit to a primary schools .", 
                "and primary kids got it and applauded straight away , '' he said .", 
                "( see 11.20am . )", 
                "corbyn admitted that some small businesses would struggle '' to pay the increased minimum wage that labour is proposing .", 
                "but the party would take steps to address this , he said .", 
                "labour is committed to paying the minimum wage at a rate needed for a decent life , which it says would be more than \u00a3 10 an hour in 2020 .", 
                "when it was put to him during the q & a that some firms would struggle with this , he replied : you 're quite right .", 
                "there are small businesses , small shops and others , that would initially struggle to pay the kind of living wage that we would all want in this room .", 
                "we 're committed to the tuc figure of \u00a3 10 .", 
                "so i think there has to be a combination of measures to get you into that position , one of which would be to reduce the levels of business rates and taxation on small enterprises and small businesses .", 
                "but also use public procurement as a leverage towards it .", 
                "so we are talking to the cbi , the federation of small business and others about this .", 
                "jonathan bartley , the co-leader of the green party , has been jeered by labour members for defending his party 's decision to put up a candidate for the copeland byelection only minutes after saying labour and the greens should form an electoral pact .", 
                "in a panel session bartley said that if progressive parties like labour and the greens cooperate , they could achieve seismic change '' at the election .", 
                "anyone who wants to stop progressive politics dying needs to actively support real democracy and proportional representation and the best route to that is through a progressive agreement of some sort .", 
                "i know that any sort of progressive pact is not an easy concept for any of us , especially for people like you and me who spend hours banging on doors for a party that we all really believe in .", 
                "but my plea to people in this room is actually quite simple .", 
                "let 's at least explore whether some form of joint working might better deliver us a progressive government in 2020 when it happens , when we find agreement , when we work together , there can be seismic change .", 
                "just think back to 1997 when martin bell stood against neil hamilton in tatton , a rock-solid safe tory seat where neil hamilton had won 55 % of the vote and the other parties withdrew .", 
                "martin bell stood there and overturned that rock-solid majority , and overturned it very significantly .", 
                "it 's not just marginal seats we could win .", 
                "we could kick out safe tory seats .", 
                "we could have seismic change in this country if we were prepared to put aside our differences , maybe have open primaries , maybe stand aside for one another , maybe involve the community in selecting those candidates .", 
                "but it was put to him that the greens are not adopting this spirit in the copeland byelection where they have decided they will field a candidate , even though this could increase the chances of labour losing its small majority .", 
                "members of the audience jeered at bartley over this .", 
                "he defended his party 's move , saying : we have a system whereby the local party decides .", 
                "a group of labour mps has backed a pamphlet calling on the party to agree on a series of brexit red lines , including only leaving the eu single market if it causes no economic damage , and defending rights over work and the environment .", 
                "as peter walker reports , the publication , produced jointly by the labour-affiliated fabian society and the brexit pressure group open britain , outlines six principles for progressives '' that the party could use to pressure the government over the process .",
