                "david cameron has effectively launched his campaign to keep britain in the european union following the publication of a draft plan offering new terms of membership .", 
                "brushing aside assertions that the plan , published by donald tusk , president of the european council , does not fully match the demands he set out in november , cameron said he had got what he promised in the conservative election manifesto .", 
                "the deal still has to be agreed at an eu summit starting on thursday 18 february , but cameron indicated that he was happy with what was on offer and , in a speech in chippenham , he focused on how britain could have the best of both worlds if it opted to stay in a reformed eu .", 
                "he said he hoped the eu referendum campaign will start soon , all but confirming he is planning a june referendum .", 
                "he also said that government ministers who want to argue for britain to leave the eu will have to wait until after the eu summit before they speak out , meaning that he has a two-week advantage over them as the debate gets going .", 
                "significantly , while cameron today became de facto leader of the in campaign , the out campaign remains divided , and bereft of a leader .", 
                "tusk has proposed giving the uk an emergency brake that would allow the uk to stop eu migrants claiming benefits - although the full details have not been resolved , and the smallprint of tusk 's document makes it clear that individual migrants would not be deprived of all in-work benefits for a full four years , as cameron wanted .", 
                "it has also emerged that the brake may not come into force until almost a year after the eu referendum .", 
                "some eastern european countries have expressed some reservations about tusk 's plans , but so far nothing has been said by eu leaders to suggest that a deal at the february summit will be impossible .", 
                "cameron is to travel to denmark and poland at the end of this week to argue the case for the tusk plans .", 
                "according to politico , konrad szyma\u00e5\u0084ski , poland 's europe minister , said the first three of tusk 's proposals were acceptable .", 
                "szyma\u00e5\u0084ski went on : the fourth one is the problem .", 
                "we ca n't accept discrimination but then how does cameron offer something for people who are against migration ?", 
                "we understand british concerns .",

                "boris johnson , the conservative mp and mayor of london , has said that much , much more needs to be done to get an acceptable deal for the uk .", 
                "speaking on lbc ( see 9.59am ) , he even lapsed into sarcasm when discussing what has been achieved .", 
                "other tory mps have spoken about about the deal , but mostly they have been conservatives who were already expected to vote out .", 
                "many tory mps still seem to be uncommitted .", 
                "there have been reports saying cameron thinks johnson will eventually back remaining in the eu , but today johnson did his best to suggest that that was not a given .", 
                "theresa may , the home secretary , has offered her qualified support for the tusk deal , the sun reports .", 
                "this suggests she will eventually decide to campaign for britain to remain in the eu .", 
                "until now she has been keeping her intentions secret .", 
                "tom newton dunn ( @ tnewtondunn ) breaking : theresa may says draft eu agreement is the `` basis for a deal '' .", 
                "a big intervention , clearest sign yet she will campaign for remain .", 
                "alan johnson , head of the labour in for britain campaign , has said labour backs a referendum in june .", 
                "he told sky news .", 
                "the labour party believes june 23 or 30 is exactly the right date .", 
                "i think that 's better for those who want britain to stay in the european union , to do that quickly .", 
                "it lifts this cloud of uncertainty that has actually been overshadowing this country , in terms of business investment et cetera , for too long .", 
                "this is significant because some tory mps would like to try to delay the referendum , and some hoped that labour could be persuaded to vote with them against a june referendum .", 
                "johnson 's comment has quashed this plan .", 
                "jeremy corbyn , the labour leader , has criticised cameron for not coming to the commons to explain the eu renegotiation plan .", 
                "speaking in the commons , he said : [ cameron ] is trumpeting the sovereignty of national parliaments as part of the renegotiations but does n't seem to respect the sovereignty of this parliament by coming here today to make the statement he should have done this whole process conducted by the prime minister is not about engaging with parliament , is not about engaging with the necessary questioning by mps , it is about managing the problems within the conservative party about this .", 
                "cameron will be making a statement in the commons on this tomorrow .", 
                "that 's all from us for today .",

                "but we 'll start with it because it is not just the issue that has generated most interest , but also the one where the gap between what cameron wanted and what he was likely to get seemed widest .", 
                "what cameron wanted this is what cameron said about his overall aim .", 
                "britain has always been an open , trading nation , and we do not want to change that .", 
                "but we do want to find arrangements to allow a member state like the uk to restore a sense of fairness to our immigration system and to reduce the current very high level of population flows from within the eu into the uk .", 
                "and here are the specific demands he made .", 
                "we need to ensure that when new countries are admitted to the eu in the future , free movement will not apply to those new members until their economies have converged much more closely with existing member states .", 
                "we also need to crack down on the abuse of free movement , an issue on which i have found wide support in my discussions with colleagues .", 
                "this includes tougher and longer re-entry bans for fraudsters and people who collude in sham it means addressing the fact that it is easier for an eu citizen to bring a non-eu spouse to britain than it is for a british citizen to do the same .", 
                "it means stronger powers to deport criminals and stop them coming back , as well as preventing entry in the first place .", 
                "and it means addressing ecj ( european court of justice ) judgments that have widened the scope of free movement in a way that has made it more difficult to tackle this kind of abuse .", 
                "but we need to go further to reduce the numbers coming here .", 
                "as i have said previously , we can reduce the flow of people coming from within the eu by reducing the draw that our welfare system can exert across europe .", 
                "so we have proposed that people coming to britain from the eu must live here and contribute for four years before they qualify for in-work benefits or social housing .", 
                "and that we should end the practice of sending child benefit overseas .", 
                "what tusk offers this is what tusk says in his statement .", 
                "on social benefits and free movement , we need to fully respect the current treaties , in particular the principles of freedom of movement and non-discrimination .", 
                "therefore the proposed solution to address the uk concerns builds on the clarification of the interpretation of current rules , including a draft commission declaration on a number of issues relating to better fighting abuse of free movement .", 
                "the draft decision of the heads notes , in particular , the commission 's intention to propose changes to eu legislation as regards the export of child benefits and the creation of a safeguard mechanism to respond to exceptional situations of inflow of workers from other member states .", 
                "a draft commission declaration also relates to this mechanism .", 
                "this approach , as well as the exact duration of the application of such a mechanism need to be further discussed at our level .", 
                "but what matters is the details .", 
                "in section d of the main document , paragraph 2 ( b ) , tusk sets out how the rule allowing the uk to stop eu migrants claiming benefits for four years would work .", 
                "a member state wishing to avail itself of the mechanism would notify the commission and the council that such an exceptional situation exists on a scale that affects essential aspects of its social security system , including the primary purpose of its in-work benefits system , or which leads to difficulties which are serious and liable to persist in its employment market or are putting an excessive pressure on the proper functioning of its public services .", 
                "on a proposal from the commission having examined the notification , the council could , by means of an implementing act , authorise the member state concerned to restrict access to in-work welfare benefits to the extent necessary .", 
                "the implementing act would authorise the member state to limit the access of union workers newly entering its labour market to in-work benefits for a total period of up to four years from the commencement of employment .", 
                "the limitation should be graduated , from an initial complete exclusion but gradually increasing access to such benefits to take account of the growing connection of the worker with the labour market of the host member state .", 
                "the council implementing act would have a limited duration and apply to eu workers newly entering its labour market during a period of [ x ] years , extendable for two successive periods of [ y ] years and [ z ] years .", 
                "he also says that eu migrants getting child benefit for children living outside the uk would be paid at a level appropriate to the member state where the child resides ; that members states can take further action against tackle sham marriages and fraudulent immigration claims ; and that members states can take action against citizens who represent a serious threat to security .", 
                "snap analysis this is not quite what david cameron wanted .", 
                "the phrase about gradually increasing access to such benefits to take account of the growing connection of the worker with the labour market means that eu migrants would not face a total ban on in-work benefits for four years .", 
                "and the tusk proposal would not end the practice of sending child benefit overseas , just limit the amount of child benefit sent overseas .", 
                "the gaps in the document - marked by x , y and z in square brackets - also illustrate the extent to which the debate about how long the uk would be allowed to apply its emergency brake ( allowing it to stop eu migrants claiming benefits ) is unresolved ."

                "just over three years ago , in what became known as the bloomberg speech , david cameron unveiled his plan to renegotiate britain 's terms of membership of the european union and then hold an in/out referendum .", 
                "the strategy was contingent on his winning the 2015 general election , but he passed that hurdle and commenced the renegotiation .", 
                "today we are going to get the draft result , almost certainly paving the way for a referendum in june .", 
                "it will be the first referendum on europe in the uk since 1975 and , with cameron claiming this should settle the issue for a generation , for many voters it could conceivably be the only time they ever get to vote on the matter .", 
                "what we will get today is a document from donald tusk , president of the european council , setting out draft proposals for discussion at the eu summit on thursday 18 and friday 19 february .", 
                "it is expected to be between 15 to 20 pages long , and it should be quite technical .", 
                "it will be up to eu leaders to negotiate the final package , and some details may change , but tusk would not be publishing this plan if he did not think it was a basis for consensus and the eventual outcome is likely to be very similar to what gets published today .", 
                "many in the uk have already made up their minds .", 
                "but roughly a third of the electorate are open to persuasion one way or another , and the renegotiation should have some impact .", 
                "they will be swayed not so much by the detail ( some of which will be very complex ) as by overall judgments as to whether or not cameron has secured a good deal .", 
                "and the tusk text matters for another reason ; if britain does vote to stay in the eu , the rules governing our relationship with brussels will be different .", 
                "the changes may not be massive and radical , but they wo n't be meaningless either .", 
                "here is our preview story .",
