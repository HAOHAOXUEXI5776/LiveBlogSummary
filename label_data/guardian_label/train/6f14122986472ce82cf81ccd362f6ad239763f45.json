                "the weather may be marking the anniversary of the 1987 storms which hit the uk with ex-hurricane ophelia causing shutdowns in ireland .", 
                "but the stock market storms which accompanied the bad weather thirty years ago are far from investors ' minds .", 
                "quite the reverse , with the msci all country world share index hitting a new peak of 495.37 .", 
                "with the dow jones industrial average at another record high on friday and the nikkei 225 up nearly 0.5 % for its tenth day of rises , european markets are expected to open higher .", 
                "igsquawk ( @ igsquawk ) our european opening calls : $ ftse 7554 +0.25 % $ dax 13013 +0.17 % $ cac 5364 +0.22 % $ ibex 10279 +0.20 % $ mib 22409 -0.02 % michael hewson , chief market analyst at cmc markets uk , said : last week saw new record closes for the msci world index , ftse100 , ftse250 , german dax as well as the major us markets , while the nikkei225 enjoyed its highest levels since 1996 , as investors continue to adopt an optimistic outlook for the global economy , putting aside concerns about geopolitics in their hunt for returns .", 
                "while all the talk is of a possible easing back from the current easy monetary policy stance the fact remains that even with a moderate retreat from the us federal reserve , the european central bank and the bank of england the fact remains that interest rates will still be nailed to the floor on a historical basis .", 
                "that 's not to say that we might not see some sort of policy mistake , but it would need to be a real doozy , and for now that does n't seem likely at this point .", 
                "it is more likely to be a geopolitical intervention that could upend the apple cart .", 
                "there is of course the continuing uncertainty over brexit discussions , as the clock ticks down and eu leaders hold a summit this week .", 
                "more immediately there is the outcome of the austrian election , with gains by the far right and the implications of that for eu policy , not to mention a setback for german chancellor angela merkel in local elections at the weekend .", 
                "and the catalan confrontation with madrid could come to a head today as the region 's president clarifies his position on independence after the recent referendum .", 
                "elsewhere , oil is on the rise as tensions grow in iraq , with federal forces moving to enter the disputed oil-rich city of kirkuk following the kurdistan government 's referendum last month .", 
                "there is of course also the prospect of renewed sanctions against iran following donald trump 's hostility to the nuclear deal with the country .", 
                "so brent is up just over 1 % at $ 57.83 a barrel , while west texas intermediate has climbed 0.8 % to $ 51.88 .", 
                "on the inflation front , chinese factory gate prices rose by more than expected , suggesting that global inflationary pressures could start building .", 
                "the benign inflation outlook up until now is something that has been puzzling central bankers like the us federal reserve chair janet yellen .", 
                "( more shortly ) it is a little thin on the economic data front today .",
