                "in november david cameron set out his eu renegotiation demands in a letter ( pdf ) to donald tusk , president of the european council ( the body of eu leaders ) .", 
                "he set out demands in four areas .", 
                "tusk 's letter today gives the most detailed official statement we 've had so far as to progress being made in all four areas .", 
                "in summary , tusk implies that the eu has already agreed two , or two and a half , of cameron 's demands .", 
                "but on eu migrants ' access to benefits there are serious problems , tusk admits .", 
                "here are the key points .", 
                "tusk said that there were substantial political differences '' because eu leaders do not agree with david cameron 's call for the uk to be allowed to stop eu migrants claiming benefits for four years .", 
                "but there could be agreement on his call for the uk to be allowed to stop having to pay child benefit to eu migrants whose children live abroad , tusk said .", 
                "he wrote : the fourth basket on social benefits and the free movement of persons is the most delicate and will require a substantive political debate at our december meeting .", 
                "while we see good prospects for agreeing on ways to fight abuses and possibly on some reforms related to the export of child benefits , there is presently no consensus on the request that people coming to britain from the eu must live there and contribute for four years before they qualify for in-work benefits or social housing .", 
                "this is certainly an issue where we need to hear more from the british prime minister and an open debate among ourselves before proceeding further we also have to overcome the substantial political differences that we still have on the issue of social benefits and free movement .", 
                "he said progress was being made on the issue of protecting non-eurozone countries .", 
                "this is the issue that george osborne considers more important than any other , and tusk suggested eu leaders may agree to the uk government 's call for non-eurozone countries to be able to exercise some kind of emergency brake '' if their interest are being threatened .", 
                "he said : on the relations between the euro ins and outs we could search for an agreement around a set of principles that will ensure the possibility for the euro area to develop further and be efficient while avoiding any kind of discrimination vis-a-vis member states that are not yet , or , in some cases , will not be part of the euro .", 
                "we are also looking into the possibility of a mechanism that will support these principles by allowing member states that are not in the euro the opportunity to raise concerns , and have them heard , if they feel that these principles are not being followed , without this turning into a veto right .", 
                "he suggested eu leaders agree with cameron 's demands on competitiveness .", 
                "on competitiveness , there is a very strong determination to promote this objective and to fully use the potential of the internal market in all its components .", 
                "everybody agrees on the need to further work on better regulation and on lessening the burdens on business while maintaining high standards .", 
                "the contribution of trade to growth is also very important in this respect , in particular trade agreements with fast growing parts of the world .", 
                "he indicated that , in practice , there was agreement that britain should not be bound by the call for ever closer union '' in the eu treaties .", 
                "cameron has recently been talking this up as his key demand , and tusk 's letter suggests this is in the bag , even though he did not go into precisely how the treaties may be rewritten .", 
                "he also hinted there was support for reform along the lines of giving national parliaments a red card '' over eu law - another cameron demand .", 
                "tusk said .", 
                "there is wide agreement that the concept of ever closer union among the peoples '' allows for various paths of integration for different countries .", 
                "those that want to deepen integration can move ahead , while respecting the wish of those who do not want to deepen any further .", 
                "there is also a largely shared view on the importance of the role of national parliaments within the union as well as strong emphasis on the principle of subsidiarity .", 
                "he urged all member states to show a readiness for compromise '' .", 
                "he said he wanted a deal as quickly as possible because the current uncertainty was destabilising '' .", 
                "uncertainty about the future of the uk in the european union is a destabilizing factor .", 
                "that is why we must find a way to answer the british concerns as quickly as possible .", 
                "he said he wanted to prepare a concrete proposal '' for reform for eu leaders to be able to adopt in february .", 
                "he said there was no agreement yet on the exact legal form the final deal will take '' .", 
                "this is a reference to cameron wanting an assurance that the deal will be legally binding , and that it will be written into eu law at a future eu treaty change .", 
                "he said that , although the issues raised were difficult '' , there was a strong will '' in the eu to get a solution .",
