                "the australian signals directorate detected more than 1,200 cyber security incidents in 2015 , including attacks on government agencies and non-government sectors , according to the white paper .", 
                "the document also specifically refers to climate change as a major challenge for australia 's pacific neighbours , which would contribute to food shortages and extreme weather events to which australia would be called on to respond .", 
                "the white paper says while there is no more than a remote chance of a military attack on australian territory by another country , australia can not be complacent and must be prepared to respond quickly and effectively when its interests are threatened , either by countries or non-state actors like terrorists .", 
                "it says terrorist attacks in paris and elsewhere show groups continue to have the willingness and ability to launch attacks anywhere .", 
                "we can expect greater uncertainty in australia 's strategic environment over the next two decades as a consequence of : the changes in the distribution of power in the indo-pacific and globally ; the continuing threat of terrorism from groups like daesh and from foreign terrorist fighters ; the modernisation of regional military capabilities ; the introduction of new military technologies such as cyber systems ; and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile technology .", 
                "like previous white papers , the document says the relationship between the us and china will be the most strategically important factor in the security and economic development of the indo-pacific in coming decades .",

                "the relationship between the united states and china is likely to be characterised by a mixture of cooperation and competition depending on where and how their interests intersect \u0080\u00a6 while major conflict between the united states and china is unlikely , there are a number of points of friction in the region in which differences between the united states and china could generate rising tensions .",
