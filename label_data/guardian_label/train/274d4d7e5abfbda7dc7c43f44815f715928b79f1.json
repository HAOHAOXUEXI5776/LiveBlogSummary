                "welcome to the guardian 's live coverage as the high court in pretoria prepares to reconvene to hear judgment handed down on oscar pistorius for four charges - most significantly , the charge that he murdered his girlfriend , reeva steenkamp , at his home on the night of 14 february 2013 .", 
                "the athlete denies the charge , claiming he believed there was an intruder in his house .", 
                "alongside the charge of murder , pistorius is accused of two counts of discharging firearms in public , and another of illegal possession of ammunition .", 
                "judge thokozile masipa will this morning begin to read her judgment .", 
                "it is not yet clear how long it will take or at what point she will announce her verdict on pistorius ' guilt or innocence on the main charge .", 
                "this blog will have live coverage throughout .", 
                "south africa does not have jury trials ; the verdict is entirely masipa 's , though she has had the advice of two assessors who sat with her through the lengthy trial process .", 
                "you can read more about them and their role here .", 
                "last month saw the prosecution and defence deliver their closing arguments ( or heads of arguments ) .", 
                "you can read a detailed summary of those here , and these are the links to the full written heads filed by the state and the defence .", 
                "in brief : the prosecution says pistorius is guilty of murder .", 
                "lead counsel for the state gerrie nel told the court that the accused 's actions in fetching the gun and walking down the corridor towards the bathroom indicate premeditation .", 
                "whether he believed the person behind the door was an intruder or knew it was steenkamp , it was murder by dolus directus ( premeditated murder ) or dolus eventualis ( he must have known he was likely to kill the person by firing ) .", 
                "nel told the judge : the accused intended to kill a human being .", 
                "he knew there was a human being in that toilet . ''", 
                "the prosecution contends that the pair were arguing .", 
                "a witness says she heard a row , another saw the bathroom light on and steenkamp 's stomach contents indicate she was awake and eating several hours after pistorius said they had gone to sleep .", 
                "witnesses also heard intermingling '' screams of a man and a woman .", 
                "whatsapp messages between the pair showed steenkamp saying she was scared '' of her boyfriend .", 
                "the defence insists pistorius should be acquitted .", 
                "if the firing of the gun was purely reflexive , he lacked criminal capacity ; if there was a thought process , it was putative private defence '' ( self-defence ) because he believed he was in danger - that an intruder was coming out of the toilet .", 
                "he had no motive to kill steenkamp .", 
                "he has always said he thought it was an intruder .", 
                "the defence says the state 's version of events - in which the fatal shots were fired at 3.17am - can not be true .", 
                "the defence says noises heard at 3.17am were the thuds of the cricket bat as pistorius broke down the toilet door .", 
                "the shots , it contends , were earlier , which means the screams heard before 3.17am were made by the accused , and not by steenkamp , who was already fatally wounded .",
