                "but the damage to the economy appears to have increased much further under the capital controls .", 
                "last week 's ec business & consumer survey revealed a sharp slump in economic sentiment across all of the main sectors of the economy in july , pointing to the likelihood of much weaker levels of activity .", 
                "and this was supported by july 's manufacturing purchasing managers ' index , which included a precipitous collapse in the output index from june 's reading of 44.8 to an incredibly weak 18.8 .",

                "and even if it does , sharp declines in the pmi sub-orders indices in july suggest that it would take some time for growth to recover back towards normal '' rates .",

                "perhaps more importantly , the very low starting point suggests that , even with a stronger quarterly performance , next year 's average growth figure could be even weaker at -5 % or below , no doubt much worse than any figure envisaged until very recently by greece 's creditors .", 
                "against that economic backdrop , the requirement in the current bailout plan for greece to build up sizeable primary budget surpluses over the next few years looks extremely demanding , if not utterly fantastical .",
