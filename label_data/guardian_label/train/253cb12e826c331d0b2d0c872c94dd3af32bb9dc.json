                "hello and welcome to our live coverage of russia 's military intervention into the syrian civil war , with air strikes nominally against militants but in areas far from us strikes on the extremist group isis , raising questions about the new campaign 's intentions .", 
                "president vladimir putin decided to bomb syria in support of his ally , embattled syrian president bashar al-assad , after several weeks of amassing troops and aircraft at a naval base in latakia .", 
                "speaking monday at the un , putin called for an international coalition against isis , and met with us president barack obama to discuss possible cooperation in the middle east .", 
                "in moscow on wednesday , putin ruled out using ground forces .", 
                "but the strikes , only hours after russia 's parliament unanimously approved the use of military force outside , apparently took american officials aback , with one saying the strikes hardly seem indicative of a constructive role in the four-year conflict , which has killed more than 200,000 people and displaced millions of people .", 
                "the us has led a coalition bombing campaign against isis in syria and iraq for over a year , to apparently marginal effect as kurdish and iraqi ground forces have borne the brunt of ground combat .", 
                "the us and its gulf allies in the middle east have said that assad must step aside for the conflict between his government forces , fractious opposition forces and jihadi militants to have any chance at resolution , but putin has maintained that assad can play a part in the country 's future ."
