                "1 ) fed chair janet yellen insisted that the us economy was in decent shape , as america 's central bank delivered its first hike in borrowing costs since december 2015 .", 
                "she said : our decision to raise rates should certainly be understood as a reflection of the confidence we have in the progress the economy has made and our judgment that that progress will continue .", 
                "it is a vote of confidence in the economy .", 
                "but this sunny view did n't last long , with yellen admitting during the press conference that the fed was operating under a \u0080\u0098cloud of uncertainty ' , until it knows more about what donald trump will do .",

                "she said : there may be some additional slack in labor markets , but i would judge that the degree of slack has diminished .", 
                "so i would say at this point that fiscal policy is not obviously needed to provide stimulus to help us get back to full employment .", 
                "but nevertheless let me be careful that i am not trying to provide advice to the new administration or to congress as to what is the appropriate stance for policy .", 
                "there are many considerations that congress needs to take account of and many bases for justifying changing fiscal policy .", 
                "3 ) fed press conferences can be quite dry affairs , but yellen 's most stirring moment came as she defended recent regulations brought in since 2008 .", 
                "asked about trump 's pledge to roll back these rules , yellen reminded us that dodd-frank was introduced to avoid another devastating financial crisis i would say it 's very important not to roll back .", 
                "there maybe some changes that could be made and we 've suggested a few , like eliminating the burden of compliance with the volcker rule or incentive compensation regulations for smaller banks or modestly raising the threshold for banks that are subject to enhanced credential supervision .", 
                "but i would urge that it 's important to keep this in place .",

                "as you said i recognize too thati could stay on as a board member , and that 's a decision for another day .", 
                "5 ) markets react , despite yellen 's calming words .", 
                "janet yellen took some pains to insist that the fed has n't radically changed its approach , even though it now expects an extra rate hike next year ( three , not two ) .", 
                "this is a very modest adjustment in the path of the fed funds rate , and involves changes by only some of the participants .", 
                "but with shares down , and the dollar rallying , investors may have concluded that trump 's election win changes the monetary policy landscape .",
