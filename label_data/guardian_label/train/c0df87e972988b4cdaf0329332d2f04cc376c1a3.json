                "in many ways , pretty good .", 
                "softly-spoken , engaging ( in the literal sense - he seemed to engage well with the questions he was asked ) and straightforward , if you were to forget for a moment all the ira stuff he probably dominated the programme .", 
                "it helped that he did not sound anything like the wild trot de in the media , and when he made the case that corbynite policies on , for example , housing were not extreme , he was persuasive .", 
                "it was also striking how much better he is at this than his boss .", 
                "when corbyn recorded a clip for the broadcasters on wednesday saying he did not sing the national anthem because he was thinking about his parents , he sounded evasive and not especially credible .", 
                "mcdonnell made the story sound much more plausible .", 
                "but did he manage to make his apology sound plausible ?", 
                "judging by twitter ( see 11.21pm ) , only up to a point .", 
                "his thatcher apology partly took the form of a joke but , given that he was apologising for a joke , that seemed fair enough .", 
                "his ira apology came over as genuinely sincere , and even heartfelt .", 
                "but while he was happy to say sorry for lauding the ira , he certainly did n't shed the accusation that he was overly sympathetic to violent republicanism .", 
                "corbyn faces the same problem too .", 
                "quite how much this will damage them politically remains to be seen .", 
                "those who feel most strongly about this are probably people unlikely to vote labour anyway , but you do n't have to be a tory to feel a deep revulsion towards the ira .", 
                "overall , mcdonnell came over as someone who will do well at trying to sell the anti-austerity message to a public still sold on sound money economics .", 
                "but getting the voters to swallow the corbyn/mcdonnell anti-imperialism agenda at the same time may be asking a bit much , and tonight 's question time illustrated the full scale of the challenge .", 
                "mcdonnell made some progress in trying to persuade people that labour is not now run by ira apologists , but he certainly did not bury the issue for good .",
