                "ministers are considering amending freedom of information legislation to strengthen the ability of the government to veto the publication of documents , in the light of the supreme court 's black spider ruling saying some of prince charles 's letters to whitehall departments much be published .", 
                "the letters will be published at 4pm , following the supreme court ruling .", 
                "under the original freedom of information act , ministers supposedly had the ability to veto the publication of material under the act in extreme circumstances , but the supreme court decision in the charles ' letters cased exposed a loophole in this .", 
                "the prime minister 's spokesman said the ruling had generated some uncertainty about how extensive the power of veto was and that , in the light of this , the government would look at the law with a view to boosting the veto power .", 
                "he said the government would consider the issue carefully , and taking into account views across the house of commons .", 
                "the government believed there was a strong case for ministers having the right to veto the publication of material , he said .", 
                "in 2011 the foi legislation was amended to provide an absolute exemption on all requests relating to the queen and prince charles , although that did not stop the release of the black spider letters because they predate that .", 
                "the spokesman implied that the proposed new veto powers would go further , covering a wider range of material , not just royal letters .", 
                "update at 1.56pm : i 've amended the penultimate sentence above because it was labour that passed the bill to exempt the queen and prince charles 's letters from the foi act , not the coalition , although the new rules came into force in 2011 .", 
                "see 1.56pm .", 
                "the spokesman said cameron still believed that the supreme court 's decision to order the publication of the letters was deeply disappointing , as he said in march .", 
                "downing street has signalled that the proposed anti-extremist disruption orders announced today ( see 9.09am ) will not be used against people like trade unionists advocating law-breaking , or those speaking out against gay marriage .", 
                "the spokesman said the orders were intended to be used instead against people like islamist extremist and neo-nazis .", 
                "and he pointed out that the government already has a definition of the kind of extremism these orders are intended to target .", 
                "it is : vocal or active opposition to fundamental british values , including democracy , the rule of law , individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance of different faiths and beliefs .", 
                "we also include in our definition of extremism calls for the death of members of our armed forces , whether in this country or overseas .", 
                "the spokesman said that the government could consider tightening asylum rules in relation to extremists .", 
                "this was a proposal that theresa may set out in her speech on counter-extremism in march .", 
                "the spokesman said the government was also interested in may 's plan to tighten the rules allowing universities and colleges to sponsor immigrants applying for student visas .", 
                "asked if may was also keen on imposing benefit sanctions on people who do not learn english , as she implied in her march speech , the spokesman said : i do n't think she has changed her view on that .", 
                "the spokesman said cameron was still opposed to the planned 10 % pay rise for mps .", 
                "the independent parliamentary standards authority has to review this proposal , and the spokesman said cameron would urge it to take the opportunity it now has to come to a different view .",

                "david cameron 's hopes for a far-reaching overhaul of britain 's relationship with the eu were dealt an early setback on tuesday when germany said the uk 's partners would not be rushed into changing the bloc 's treaties to meet its reform demands .", 
                "in a sign of a broader distrust of london 's motives , wolfgang sch\u00e3\u00a4uble , germany 's finance minister , also lashed out at george osborne 's silly and unnecessary record of intervening over the eurozone crisis .", 
                "many in brussels believe london intentionally sought to undermine monetary union , mr sch\u00e3\u00a4uble noted .",
