                "in addition , the company has returned to profitability after the previous full year loss , whilst the dividend hike adds to an existing yield of 6.7 % , one of the highest within the ftse100 and a clear attraction for income seekers .", 
                "however , like for like sales , underlying and pre-tax profits are all sharply down on the corresponding period last year , the progress quoted in terms of the company 's online and convenience store presence is nascent , whilst the ongoing assault from the discounters continues to crimp margins .",
