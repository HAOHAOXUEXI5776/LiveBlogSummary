                "the house of lords is a peculiar place .", 
                "most of its members are anonymous but reasonably respected lifetime politicos , there is a crop of remarkably distinguished public figures , and there is also some third-rate riff-raff .", 
                "how do they all get there ?", 
                "every honours list provides some clues .", 
                "here are 10 things we can learn about how you get into the lords from today 's dissolution honours .", 
                "1 - outstanding parliamentarians have , as always , a more or less automatic pass to the house of lords .", 
                "william hague , the former conservative foreign secretary , is the obvious example on today 's list , but david blunkett , the labour former home secretary , and alistair darling , the labour former chancellor , are two more .", 
                "like most honours lists , this one contains some duds , but it also includes respected political figures like david willetts , sir george young , peter hain and tessa jowell .", 
                "if there has to be an appointed lords full of retired mps , these are the kind of people you would expect to see in it .", 
                "2 - being a member of the pm 's inner circle helps a lot .", 
                "greg barker was a middle-ranking energy minister who in normal circumstances would not expect a seat in the lords , but he was also one of the very first tory mps to back cameron for leader in 2005 , and he finally seems to have had his reward .", 
                "kate fall , cameron 's deputy chief of staff and a key number 10 confidante , has been ennobled .", 
                "and nick clegg has used his slice of the dissolution honours to give a peerage to his former chief of staff , jonny oates .", 
                "3- women are under-represented at westminster , but the lords is being used to make up the numbers .", 
                "david cameron has given more than a third of his peerages - 10 out of 25 - to women and almost half of the lib dem ones ( five out of 11 ) go to women too .", 
                "at least one of these could prove controversial .", 
                "michelle mone , the scottish businesswoman who has become a peer and entrepreneurship tsar , has already come under fire from business figures in scotland who think she is unsuitable for the post .", 
                "4 - donating helps .", 
                "selling peerages is illegal , and there is nothing to suggest wrongdoing on behalf of anyone in today 's list , but an academic study has shown that giving large sums of money to a political party does have a remarkably positive effect on the chances of said donor having their talents recognised in an honours list .", 
                "today james lupton , the conservative party 's co-treasurer and a businessman and leading philanthropist '' according to the number 10 citation , has become a lord .",

                "5 - but being a tory press baron does n't .", 
                "at the election the conservatives benefited from remarkable positive coverage in papers like the daily telegraph .", 
                "but , if anyone at telegraph hq was hoping for some pay-back , it has not arrived today .", 
                "6 - being a longstanding lib dem mp is a reliable route in .", 
                "proportionately more lib dem mps probably end up in the lords than labour or tory ones , and today 's list contains several lib dems who hardly qualify as distinguished '' but how have benefited from the lib dem peerage premium .", 
                "7 - failure does not necessarily hold you back .", 
                "as health secretary andrew lansley was responsible for the health act , probably the most contentious piece of legislation passed in the last parliament .", 
                "even supporters felt that lansley handled it badly , and he was demoted .", 
                "but that has not stopped him ending up in the lords - perhaps because he used to be cameron 's boss at the conservative research department .", 
                "see point 2 above .", 
                "8 - but getting caught in a cash-for-access sting does .", 
                "jack straw was entitled to expect elevation to the lords when he announced he was leaving the commons before the election , and sir malcolm rifkind , another former foreign secretary , would normally have expected automatic entry too .", 
                "they were both caught in a cash-for-access sting before the election .", 
                "although they both denied doing anything wrong , they were n't included in today 's list .", 
                "9 - the mps ' expenses scandal wo n't necessarily be held against you anymore .", 
                "douglas hogg was vilified in 2009 after it emerged he had claimed expenses partly on the grounds that he needed money for cleaning his moat .", 
                "today he becomes a life peer .", 
                "it will be his second peerage ; he already has a hereditary peerage - he is viscount hailsham - but that did not allow him to sit in the lords .", 
                "10 - and being rejected by the electorate is not necessarily an obstacle either .", 
                "the lib dem list includes two people going to the lords after being defeated at the general election , lorely burt , lynne featherstone , and the tory list includes anne mcintosh , who did not even get to fight the election because she was deselected by her local party .",
