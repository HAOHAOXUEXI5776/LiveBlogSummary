                "sam jones also sends these heartbreaking details from the un 's world food programme about the devastating impact of the ebola outbreak on some families : according to john crisci , the world food programme 's emergency co-ordinator in sierra leone , the spread of ebola is making it harder for people to feed their families.the average sierra leonean family spends anything from 60 % to 70 % of their income on food and with this crisis , families in highly infected hotspots such as kenema and kailahun have lost one of the breadwinners in the family either to ebola or to unemployment.in some areas , says crisci , families are now spending 80-90 % of their income on food and adopting what the wfp calls severe food coping strategies : when food becomes the predominant concern , people stop buying medicines , clothes and hygiene products.with unemployment rising in towns and the countryside as people lose jobs in banks , hotels and restaurants , farmers stop tending their lands and plantation employees shun work that involves large groups , mothers and fathers are beginning to limit what they eat.parents in some areas are now eating one meal a day to try to give two meals to their children , says crisci .", 
                "when both parents were working and had a steady income , they 'd be having three meals a day.in response , the wfp is conducting a no-regrets operation , opting to bring in and then withdraw excess resources rather than risk failing those in need .", 
                "dry rations of rice , beans , salt , vegetable oil and supercereals for children - supplemented by onions , stock cubes , tea and toothpaste from the sierra leonean government - are being delivered to families whose houses have been locked down by the military and police in the hope of halting ebola 's spread.the biggest challenge in this operation is that it 's forever-evolving , says crisci .", 
                "the number of areas in the country that are being isolated continues to grow .", 
                "we 're always moving quickly behind the target but we 're now trying to beat it.with the food pipeline beginning to open up and the wfp bringing in large shipments this month and next , crisci believes it will have the capacity to respond to the needs of up to 600,000 people.but he does not underestimate the scale of the emergency .", 
                "last week , while on an assessment mission to a village 45 miles from freetown that had been placed in isolation , he came across a quarantined house guarded by soldiers.behind them on the patio , covered with a coloured cotton sheet were two sisters , probably about two and nine years old .", 
                "one was face up and one was face down .", 
                "their mother was there on the patio , keeping a distance of couple of metres .", 
                "she was looking over at them and you could see that she was desperate and hopeless .", 
                "her hands were tied and she could n't do anything to comfort them .", 
                "she kept on looking out at the road hoping that the ambulance was coming any time .", 
                "we intervened heavily but unfortunately one of the little girls passed away .", 
                "the other sister is in a treatment centre now in port loko and we hear the chances are slim .", 
                "if it had been a kid who had broken their leg or bumped their head , we 'd have thrown them in the wfp car and run to the hospital ; we do it all the time .", 
                "but in a case like this , we could n't do anything .", 
                "we try to change the world , we try to assist millions of people but here there were these two children just lying there and none of us could do anything except pull every contact we had to get the ministry of health to intervene .", 
                "you feel like you 're doing a big thing and then you see the two children and their mother .", 
                "it broke my heart ."

                "the flights were cancelled and they ca n't come back .",

                "before , they 'd hear 30 cases a day .", 
                "now they 're adjourning cases and they 've also restricted litigants : it has to be your case and you ca n't come with lots of friends and witnesses to support you .", 
                "lots of the male prisoners are not in good health and some lawyers are worried about coming across them in the corridors.lavaly says the situation in prisons is also becoming increasingly difficult as people 's cases are adjourned .", 
                "with visits from family suspended , it is left to the ngos to bring baby food to mothers detained with young children , and to top up the prisons ' ever-dwindling supplies of chlorine , buckets and gloves.we also bring in a bit of cassava for people , because a lot of time they complain that the do n't have enough food , says lavaly .", 
                "and god forbid , if you get ebola , your immune system needs the food not to mention oral rehydration solution .", 
                "even without ebola , there are a lot of malnourished prisoners.while it applauds the efforts of those judges and magistrates still managing to do their jobs , advocaid wants the police to relieve some of the pressure by dealing with minor offences in the police station rather than clogging up the courts.but what it most needed , argues lavaly , is neither a fast-tracked legal process nor a judicial airdrop , but international help in bringing a swift end to the crisis.many of us lived through the war , she says .", 
                "it feels like we are back in that time again , but only it is worse .", 
                "then , we could see our enemy but now the enemy is unknown and could be a loved one or close associate .",
