                "\u0080\u00a6and after trump 's words on the dangers of immigration to fox and friends , as discussed below , there 's this from the associated press : the us government has mistakenly granted citizenship to at least 858 immigrants who had pending deportation orders from countries of concern to national security or with high rates of immigration fraud , according to an internal homeland security audit released monday .", 
                "in a big country 858 might not be that big a number , but that 's not going to help calm the escalating political row over immigration down , as the hunt for the suspect in the new york and new jersey bombings goes on .", 
                "that suspect , 28-year-old ahmad khan rahmani , was born in afghanistan ."

                "the same month , john kerry said the us would accept 100,000 refugees from around the world by 2017 .", 
                "by the start of september 2016 , the us had allowed in roughly 12,000 syrian refugees in the fives years since the start of the country 's civil war .", 
                "according to an october 2015 analysis by the migration policy institute , of the 784,000 refugees resettled in the us since 11 september 2001 , three have been arrested for planning terrorist activities .", 
                "furthermore : two were not planning an attack in the united states and the plans of the third were barely credible .", 
                "politifact.com says clinton 's expressed policy of admitting 65,000 refugees would indeed be a 550 % rise on current admissions , at the 10,000 level , but emphasises that she would also increase vetting , and rates trump 's claim mostly true .",
