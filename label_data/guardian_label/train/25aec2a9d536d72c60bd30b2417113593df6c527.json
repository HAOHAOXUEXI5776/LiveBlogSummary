                "to be sure , his speech will not be a bland recitation that seeks only to please and assure the gathered lawmakers .", 
                "while most vatican watchers believe the pope 's primary motivation for visiting the us was to attend the world meeting of families in philadelphia this weekend , he clearly sees his visit to the nation 's capital as an opportunity to issue a call to conscience and challenge lawmakers on the issues at the heart of his papacy .", 
                "francis has already indicated in speeches that he is not shying away from controversy .", 
                "although his language is not abrasive , his repeated references to himself as the son of immigrants , for example , marks an attempt not only to identify with the american experience , but to gently chastise those who have vilified immigrants as freeloaders who take but do not enrich society .", 
                "he will seek not to lecture , but to nudge the assembled politicians - who are overwhelmingly christian - to see things from a different and more nuanced perspective , and to free themselves of political rigidity .",
