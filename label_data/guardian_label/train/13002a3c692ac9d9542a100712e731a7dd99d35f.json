                "and here are two good articles about the chilcot report .", 
                "richard norton-taylor at the guardian says the civil service love of secrecy has played a large part in explaining the delay .", 
                "the initial cause of the delay was chilcot 's determination , strongly supported by another inquiry panel member , sir roderic lyne , to publish much more of the contents of classified documents - including 130 records of conversations between blair and bush - than the government machine wanted .", 
                "officials in the cabinet office , who saw their task as guarding hallowed british traditions of secrecy , were horrified when they first heard of chilcot 's intentions .", 
                "chilcot made clear that in his view the notes went to the heart of the inquiry - how blair led britain to join the invasion of iraq .", 
                "the notes , illuminate prime minister blair 's positions at critical points '' , he said .", 
                "the question when and how the prime minister made commitments to the us about the uk 's involvement in military action in iraq , and subsequent decisions on the uk 's continuing involvement , is central to its considerations '' , chilcot stressed .", 
                "he made the point that it was a bit rich for cabinet secretaries to stop the release of the documents given that blair and his closest advisers , including jonathan powell and alastair campbell , had been allowed to publish freely on the same events and on the same private conversations .", 
                "denis macshane at huffington post says the iraq report , when it is published , will satisfy no one .", 
                "last summer i heard a very senior us republican foreign affairs representative tell a seminar that george w bush 's invasion of iraq was the biggest us foreign policy error since the decision to withdraw from europe in 1919 . ''", 
                "the historical reference was fascinating ( and correct ) but this man was a top george w bush official who had held high office in the us administration of the time .", 
                "( the seminar was held under chatham house rules so he can not be named . )", 
                "what is discreditable and barely honourable is the position of all the retired diplomats who now shake their grey locks and say the decision was a terrible thing and saddam should have been left in peace with a few more year 's useless un inspection visits to deal with .", 
                "other than a junior fco lawyer no ambassador , diplomat or whitehall official resigned or made any public protest .", 
                "i do not recall any fco official inside the building objecting to the invasion .", 
                "after all the camel corps had been pretty keen on other invasions or toppling of arab or iranian leaders in past years when it conformed to their beliefs .", 
                "now everyone has the wisdom of hindsight .", 
                "i asked the senior american official if mr bush could ever come to admit that iraq was in talleyrand 's words worse then a crime , an error '' ?", 
                "no '' , was the reply , i do n't think that president bush can look the 4,500 families who lost a son or husband in iraq in the face and tell them the sacrifice was wasted . ''", 
                "that 's all from me for today .", 
                "i 've got to wrap up now because i 've got a meeting .", 
                "i wo n't be blogging tomorrow , but i think a colleague will be blogging instead .", 
                "thanks for the comments ."
