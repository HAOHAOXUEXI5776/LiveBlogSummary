                "johnson , the foreign secretary , said the uk would be willing to join any future american air strikes against syria if president bashar al-assad uses chemical weapons again .", 
                "( see 8.48am . )", 
                "he also refused to commit to giving parliament a vote on such an attack , although foreign office sources later said that he did not intend to signal any change from the current convention , which is that mps would get a vote beforehand unless the government had to act in an emergency .", 
                "( see 9.22am . )", 
                "in the past johnson has adopted a more accommodating approach to assad , suggesting in 2015 that the uk should work with him as part of a deal with the devil against isis .", 
                "johnson said that he was opposed to military action against north korea .", 
                "although president trump 's administration has talked up the prospect of using force to stop pyongyang 's nuclear programme , saying all options are on the table , johnson said that calm , clear heads were needed to obtain a solution .", 
                "he said : the situation in north korea has changed very substantially over the last few years .", 
                "what people thought was an almost comical question - the north korean nuclear threat - has become very real and very dangerous indeed .", 
                "we need to address it .", 
                "i think the white house are entirely right in escalating the seriousness of this question .", 
                "all north korea 's neighbours feel this threat very intensely .", 
                "to what extent is there a military solution ?", 
                "i have to say i am very , very sceptical and so are most of the experts that i 've talked to .", 
                "i think the military options are not good .", 
                "the best way forward - and i think this is what the white house wants to pursue - is to keep a calm , clear head and to work particularly with beijing to try to bring pressure on pyongyang , try to get them to see that they could have a great economic future if they could agree not to be so threatening , if they could agree a freeze or to denuclearise .", 
                "that 's got to be the way forward , but as people can see , at the moment the situation is tense .", 
                "asked if british troops could be involved in any allied military action , johnson said : all the evidence i have seen suggests to me that the military options are very far from good .", 
                "do n't forget that seoul - the capital of south korea - is only about 40 minutes from the border with north korea .", 
                "the risk of huge , hideous reprisals against south korea as a result of any kind of attack on north korea has got to be very , very severe military action against north korea , in my honest opinion , is not a good idea at the moment and i certainly do n't think it 's likely .", 
                "he defended the vote leave claim that leaving the eu would save the uk \u00e2\u00a3 350m a week .", 
                "he claimed the figure was not disputed .", 
                "( but it was , because it is not true . )", 
                "he refused to commit to saying annual net migration should be cut to below 100,000 .", 
                "when pressed on this , he said immigration was too high but he refused to back the 100,000 target , which the government is officially committed to despite most experts viewing it as highly unrealistic .", 
                "he said britain would stop paying huge sums of money in the long term to europe after brexit .", 
                "theresa may and other ministers have said before that after brexit the uk will not pay huge sums to the eu , but johnson 's reference to in the long term could be a tacit admission that the brexit deal will involve the uk paying a huge sum to the eu in the short term .", 
                "he played down the significance of comments from wilbur ross , the us commerce secretary , suggesting a uk-us trade deal is not a top priority for washington .", 
                "he said : everybody , from the white house down , has been telling us in the last few months they regard the opportunities provided by a free trade deal with the uk as extremely exciting .", 
                "he admitted that the uk would not be able to conclude trade deals with other countries within the next two years , while it remains a member of the eu .", 
                "but he said that the government would be able to prepare for these deals .", 
                "he said the uk would not be willing to pay a brexit divorce bill to the eu before substantive negotiations on a trade deal start .", 
                "he said : if you 're saying that they want the money before they get any substantive talks then that is obviously not going to happen .", 
                "he said the germans blocked a deal before christmas on the rights of eu nationals living in the uk and the rights of britons living on the continent .", 
                "he said : as theresa may has said , this is a priority for us , we want to guarantee their rights , to give them the maximum possible stability and security .", 
                "alas , we made an offer by the way before christmas that we would do a deal in advance of the negotiations , that was turned down you may recall by germany , we 're left in a position where we have to do a reciprocal deal , and we 're fine with that .", 
                "he said the election of jeremy corbyn as prime minister would be a threat to britain .", 
                "i do think there is a slight risk that people wo n't detect the threat that is hidden behind this sort of islingtonian herbivorous .", 
                "he said there was a real risk if the government was led by someone who has been hostile to nato and who would disarm britain 's nuclear weapons .",
