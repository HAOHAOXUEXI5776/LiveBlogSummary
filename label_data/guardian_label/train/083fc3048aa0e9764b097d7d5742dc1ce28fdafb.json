                "at 9.30am , the second estimate of british gdp for the last three months of 2015 is released .", 
                "it may confirm that the economy grew by 0.5 % during the quarter - unspectacular , but better than most major rivals .", 
                "but some economists reckon it could be revised down to just 0.4 % , if nervous businesses have cut their spending .", 
                "a disappointing number could inflame worries over the uk , in a week where brexit fears have already sent the pound sliding to seven-year lows .", 
                "michael hewson of cmc markets explains : in a rather strange twist of fate one of the best performing economy 's in europe over the past 12 months has found its currency take an absolute hammering in the past few weeks as investors take a rather one eyed and alarmist perspective on the potential negative consequences of a british exit from the eu in a referendum vote scheduled for june this year .", 
                "later this morning we get the latest iteration of uk q4 gdp and expectations are for growth of 0.5 % , unchanged from the previous reading , and an annualised number of 1.9 % , though we could see some evidence that business investment is starting to slow from the previous 2.2 % to 0.6 % , though the annualised measure is expected to increase to 6.4 % from 5.8 % .", 
                "also coming up today : there 's a flurry of company news hitting the wires , including results from lloyds banking group , theme park group merlin , and insurance firm rsa .", 
                "more on all those shortly .", 
                "and ofcom , the telecoms regulator , is outlining its plans to create more competition and improve britain 's broadband network .", 
                "bt , the former state monopoly , is being ordered to open its network to its rivals , to help them build their own high-speed fibre services .", 
                "however , bt has also dodged the threat of being broken up - although it 's still an option if things do n't improve .", 
                "kamal ahmed ( @ bbckamal ) ofcom : `` many people and businesses continue to suffer poor mobile coverage , especially in rural and remote areas . ''", 
                "rory cellan-jones ( @ ruskin147 ) ofocom not demanding openreach sale but says `` bt must open up network , so competitors can connect fibre to homes and offices '' we 'll be tracking all the main events through the day"
