                "the lord speaker 's committee in the lords has published its 37-page report ( pdf ) on reducing the size of the house of lords .", 
                "as was reported in advance , it proposes using 15-year terms , and a two-out , one-in approach , to get the lords down to 600 in size in just over a decade .",

                "political appointments should be shared between the parties in line with the result of the previous general election , defined as an average of the parties ' share of the national vote and of the seats won in the house of commons .", 
                "the combination of this formula and the 15 year term limit would ensure the future make-up of the house of lords reflected the political views of the country over the medium term .",

                "neil henderson ( @ hendopolis ) telegraph : sex scandal 'could be worse than expenses ' # tomorrowspaperstoday it is always rash to predict how a story will turn out , but this seems so wide of the mark that is seems worth explaining why .",

                "but the notion that this is at all comparable with the expenses scandal seems fanciful .", 
                "here are eight reasons .",

                "the daily telegraph had a disk full of expenses claims , which were true and uncontestable .", 
                "the key document in this story is a spreadsheet ( there is a version in today 's sun ) , with allegations backed up ( so far ) by little more than hearsay .", 
                "2 - much of the coverage of the story is conflating consensual sexual behaviour with sexual harassment , and worse .", 
                "society is becoming much less tolerant of sexual harassment than it used to be ( rightly ) , but at westminster and elsewhere people are becoming much more tolerant of consensual sexual behaviour which 20 years ago was a resigning matter for ministers ( eg extramarital affairs , gay sex . )", 
                "3 - newspapers are struggling to get complainants to go on the record with serious sexual misconduct allegations .", 
                "in the 1990s , when the john major government was being rocked by back to basics '' sex scandals , a sun news editor would been sacked if he had suggested to the editor splashing the paper on a story about a cabinet minister touching a female journalist 's knee 15 years previously .",

                "5 - the expenses revelation triggered genuine public outrage , but there is no evidence to suggest that people are reacting with anything like the same amount of horror to what they have been learning in the last 72 hours about sexual misconduct at westminster .", 
                "it is not that they approve ; it is just that they are probably not that surprised .", 
                "6 - the sexual misconduct scandal has not been weaponised '' for party political advantage .",
