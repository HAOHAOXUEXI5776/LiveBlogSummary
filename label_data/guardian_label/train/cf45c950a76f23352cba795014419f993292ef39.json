                "nick clegg has said british politics is threatened by a divisive us-versus-them '' approach championed by nigel farage and alex salmond which offers a false comfort of grievance '' .", 
                "as nicholas watt reports , in his speech to the liberal democrat conference in glasgow , the deputy prime minister said the ukip and snp leaders are making seductive and beguiling '' offers that are no more than a counsel of despair '' .", 
                "the strong attack on farage and salmond , the day before ukip is likely to win its first westminster seat in the clacton byelection , was designed to highlight clegg 's main pre-election pitch that he leads the only uk party rooted in the centre ground .", 
                "harriet harman , the labour deputy leader , has dismissed clegg as someone who broke his promises and who is too weak to stand up to the tories .", 
                "responding to the speech , she said : nick clegg 's speech was that of a man trying desperately to justify the decision he and his party took to back the tories all the way .", 
                "nick clegg was right about one thing in his speech : the lib dems should be judged on their record .", 
                "it is a record of broken promises and weakness .", 
                "the lib dems are a party which promised to scrap tuition fees and then trebled them .", 
                "they are a party who promised fair taxes and then gave millionaires a tax cut while everyone else pays more .", 
                "they 've backed the tories all the way .", 
                "from rising nhs waiting lists to the bedroom tax , the tories could n't have done it without them .", 
                "this is why , when nick clegg promises that with the lib dems things will be better if you give them another chance , people will be rightly wary - the libs dems ' promises are undermined by their actions .", 
                "you ca n't trust nick clegg and the lib dems .",

                "here goes : my list of 10 things we 've learned from the lib dem conference .", 
                "1 - the lib dems have no desire to give up power .", 
                "given that the experience of being in coalition has been so electorally catastrophic , you might expect the party to have some regrets .", 
                "but they do n't , and there 's no appetite for a spell in opposition .", 
                "as well as a desire for another try at government , the lib dems are also assuming there 's a good chance it will happen .", 
                "if it does n't , the party is in for a psychological shock .", 
                "2 - negotiations for a post-2015 coalition have already started .", 
                "officially the lib dems are n't meant to be talking about red lines '' , or what they would do in coalition talks , just what policies they stand for .", 
                "but in practice , even though private talks may not have started , a public negotiation has opened up with the tories , via newspapers and broadcasting studios , with nick clegg starting to reveal clues as to what is and what is not on the table .", 
                "the most significant revelation was his tacit admission that he could agree to an in/out referendum on the eu .", 
                "senior lib dems believe that the tory proposals announced in birmingham were in some respects just an opening bid ( they remember how easy david cameron found it to ditch his more rightwing ideas in coalition talks after 2010 ) and so it is not hard to start imaging how compromises could be reached .", 
                "an in/out referendum in exchange for keeping the human rights act ?", 
                "what makes this shadow bargaining particularly fascinating is that it 's a three-sided dialogue , also involving the voters too .", 
                "the more seats a party has , the stronger its hand will be after polling day .", 
                "3 - the lib dems are divided over labour .", 
                "activists would much rather see the party in coalition with labour .", 
                "a poll of candidates for the sunday politics and a poll of members for lib dem voice both showed a preference for this by a margin of about 3 to 1 .", 
                "but , from clegg downwards , lib dem ministers and other leading party figures ( eg norman lamb , here , or tim farron , here ) have spent the week telling anyone who will listen about their severe reservations about labour in general , and ed miliband in particular .", 
                "as a result 4 - a labour/lib dem coalition is looking less likely .", 
                "there are multiple areas where labour and lib dem policies overlap and , particularly in the light of the views of the lib dem activist base , a labour/lib dem coalition has until now seemed a strong possibility .", 
                "after this week that 's more doubtful .", 
                "of course , this could be another example of shadow bargaining - ie talking tough , so miliband does n't think the lib dems are a pushover - but it does not feel like that .", 
                "clegg sounds as if he is n't keen on sharing power with miliband at all .", 
                "5 - coalition is going to be harder next time around anyway .", 
                "for all the talk about coalition ( and there 's been a lot ) , no one expects a hung parliament to produce a coalition as quickly as it did in 2010 and , even if no one party gets a majority , there are good grounds for thinking it may not happen .", 
                "labour and the tories would seriously consider running minority administrations and , in the lib dems , there is growing interest in alternatives to a formal coalition .", 
                "6 - nick clegg is starting to look demob happy .", 
                "even if you do n't accept that there is anything significant about clegg turning up for work wearing jeans , he is starting to sound like someone entering the closing phase of his political career .", 
                "many people in the party think he wo n't stay on much beyond polling day , all that talk about serving a full term in government has dried up and clegg himself is starting to talk about what might happen when he 's gone .", 
                "his outburst following the gatwick vote also sounded reminiscent of what an exasperated tony blair was saying about his own party circa 2006 .", 
                "7 - quietly , the next lib dem leadership contest has already started .", 
                "no one is going to challenge clegg before the election and all the contenders have been deploying diplomatic language to sidestep questions about their ambitions .", 
                "see , for example , norman lamb at 9.53am .", 
                "but do n't be fooled ; covert campaigning is already under way .", 
                "tim farron is the front runner , clegg has all but anointed danny alexander ( who 's had a good week ) as his candidate , but there are plenty of others .", 
                "here 's a guide to the odds .", 
                "8 - conference still matters more in the lib dems than in any other party , but there are signs that could change .", 
                "the lib dems are proud of the fact that their party conference determines policy , which does n't happen with labour or the tories in any meaningful way , and yesterday 's vote on airport runways will stop the party backing gatwick expansion in its manifesto ( unless there 's a radical rethink at the spring conference in march ) .", 
                "but clegg 's reaction suggests the time may come when the party leadership will get less accommodating .", 
                "and a decision on saturday to back omov ( one member , one vote ) for party conference , meaning any member will be able to turn up and vote , not just a limited number of designated representatives , could result in future conferences taking many more decisions the leadership finds unpalatable .", 
                "9 - none of the three main parties is being particularly open about the cuts required after 2015 .", 
                "the lib dems have a good claim to be the party that is being more open than the others about the tough financial decisions that will have to be taken after the general election , but the competition for this prize is not exactly very strong .", 
                "in truth , we 've got to the end of the party conference season with all three parties providing scant detail about what the deficit reduction measures they anticipate will actually mean in practice .", 
                "10 - for a party facing electoral meltdown , the mood is surprisingly positive .", 
                "privately the lib dems expect to lose roughly half the 57 seats they won in the 2010 general election , but the mood at glasgow has n't been despondent .", 
                "why ?", 
                "yesterday the lib dems passed a motion on football complaining that winning has become the primary motive in the sport '' .", 
                "this provoked much mockery , but it contains a wider truth that applies to politics too ; for the lib dems , and others with an idealistic bent , it 's not just about winning ."
