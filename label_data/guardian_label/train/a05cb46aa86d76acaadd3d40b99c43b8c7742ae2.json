                "today monday 24 november marks the deadline for iran and six world powers ( the us , uk , france , germany , russia and china ) to reach agreement on the curtailing of iran 's nuclear capabilities and the lifting of un , us and eu sanctions against tehran .", 
                "the midnight monday deadline is a self-imposed one , agreed as part of an interim deal last november .", 
                "but there is pressure for the talks in vienna to produce a breakthrough today after nine months of twisty negotiations .", 
                "the uk foreign secretary , philip hammond , said on sunday evening that there would be a last big push to secure a deal , but as the guardian 's diplomatic editor , julian borger , reports from vienna , the shape of that deal is still unclear : western diplomats said that achieving a comprehensive deal in the last 24 hours was looking increasingly difficult , but added that none of the seven countries represented in vienna was willing to allow the negotiations to collapse given the progress that had been made and the dire consequences of failure for middle east stability .", 
                "they said the talks could be given extra time , but it was unclear whether the foreign ministers in vienna would sign a framework agreement , leaving some details to be worked out later , as proof of progress .", 
                "another , less ambitious option , would be for them to issue a political statement of intent which resolved few , if any , of the remaining contentious issues , but which envisaged concluding a deal in the future .", 
                "in the last few minutes , the reuters news agency has reported that the talks could be adjourned after the two sides failed to secure a deal .", 
                "iran and six world powers could reconvene next month , possibly in oman , a source close to the talks reportedly told reuters .", 
                "you can follow julian borger 's updates from vienna here on the liveblog today and on twitter : @ twitterid .", 
                "i 'll be updating this liveblog throughout monday as the deadline approaches , and posting key developments on twitter , @ twitterid phipps ."
