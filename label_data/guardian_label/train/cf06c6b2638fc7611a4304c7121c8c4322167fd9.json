                "for david cameron , that was a moderately good result .", 
                "angela merkel sounded fairly optimistic about the prospect of his proposed eu renegotiation succeeding .", 
                "but the most significant answer might have been the one in which he hinted that he is dropping one of his demands .", 
                "here are the key points from the press conference .", 
                "cameron hinted that he may be dropping his demand for eu migrants to be prevented from coming to the uk to work unless they have already got a job .", 
                "he did not say this explicitly , but it was very striking that he chose to omit this when he was spelling out his list of requirements from eu reform .", 
                "he told the press conference .", 
                "the very clear things i 've set out is saying that if you come here you should not be here for unemployment benefit ; if you come and you have n't found a job in six months , you should return to your country of origin ; if you have n't paid in to the system for four years , you ca n't start to get out of the system ; and , if your family and your children are back at home in another european country , you should n't be getting child benefit here in britain .", 
                "those are four of the welfare and immigration steps i 've set out .", 
                "but in his immigration speech last year he said , among other things : we want eu jobseekers to have a job offer before they come here and to stop uk taxpayers having to support them if they do n't .", 
                "merkel said she thought a solution could be found that would enable the uk to remain in the eu .", 
                "the uk and other eu leaders had managed to resolve apparently intractable problems before , she said .", 
                "i can only build on what i said earlier on ; where there 's a will , there 's a way , to find common solutions .", 
                "issues were discussed here in downing street on the financial perspective , for example , and it was not at all clear at the time that we would find a way .", 
                "but we stuck together and we brought about a solution , we found a way .", 
                "and it is in this spirit we address all of the outstanding issues .", 
                "she also said that there had already been talks with the uk about this and that they had been intense '' ( i think she meant thorough , not highly-charged ) and friendly '' .", 
                "and she reaffirmed her wish for the uk to remain in the eu .", 
                "i do n't want to hide from you that i very much like having the uk in a strong and successful european union and like working together with britain for a better future .", 
                "merkel said that she accepted that the eu had to deal with the issue of the abuse of benefits .", 
                "she was committed to preserving the freedom of movement in the eu , she said .", 
                "but she went on : but we also have to look at abuse of [ freedom of movement ] .", 
                "we are looking at the legal , we are looking at legislation here .", 
                "we want to see how this plays out at local level .", 
                "we want to also say to our local authorities that abuse needs to be fought against so that freedom of movement can prevail .", 
                "and one has to take a very close look at the social security systems of individual member states to what extent they have to be adjusted to this situation .", 
                "she would not be drawn specifically on whether she favoured stopping eu migrants receiving benefits for children living abroad .", 
                "she said a recent european court of justice ruling on this had been helpful .", 
                "but this was a matter that needed to be considered alongside other issues , she said .", 
                "cameron said he was confident that he could get a satisfactory deal for the uk in his eu renegotiation .", 
                "i want to fix the problems in britain 's relationship with the eu which the british people can find very frustrating .", 
                "i 'm convinced this can be done .", 
                "as the chancellor said when she last stood in this room , where there 's a will , there 's a way .", 
                "and that 's very much my attitude too .", 
                "merkel refused to speculate on whether the uk would need to allow freedom of movement for eu workers if it left the eu as the price for having a free trade deal .", 
                "itv 's tom bradby said this was the case with switzerland .", 
                "cameron conceded this was a flaw in the argument presented by those in favour of leaving the eu .", 
                "he said : i do n't think that the right answer is for britain to leave the eu as for those people who argue from now its time to leave the european union , it 's for them to answer your question about what that means .", 
                "i think the answers they give are often very contradictory in respect of the points you make about switzerland and norway .", 
                "cameron revealed that he and merkel had been briefed by mi6 on the attack on paris .", 
                "cameron said western countries should never give up their commitment to freedom of speech .", 
                "the countries that succeeded would be those that stuck to the values of freedom and the rule of law , he said .", 
                "nigel farage has accused cameron of supporting open-door immigration .", 
                "nigel farage ( @ nigel farage ) mr cameron made big overtures last month .", 
                "but 48 hours with mrs merkel and he 's already repeatedly committing to open door immigration again that 's all from me for today .",
