                "and yet people flock to hear him .", 
                "only nicola sturgeon , george galloway or nigel farage come close in terms of being able to fill a hall , which means this summer he has a right to say he has become one of the great speakers of our time .",

                "the tuc speech provides some clues .", 
                "on the downside , it was clunky , not particularly well structured , a bit too monotone and bereft of any strong applause lines .", 
                "but , on the upside , it was authentic - and interesting .", 
                "there was no guff about hardworking families , and none of the coded euphemisms or bland triangulations that litter conventional speeches .", 
                "the words meant what they were intended to mean .", 
                "and , idealistic though much of it was , much of what he had to say was refreshingly different .", 
                "for example , corbyn must be the first senior british politician to criticise communist china for being too free-market .", 
                "he also expanded the attack on the trade union bill creatively , and what he had to say about policy making was genuinely intriguing ( although probably a bit unrealistic too ) .", 
                "corbyn did not challenge his audience in any meaningful way , and the speech may reinforce concerns that , at heart , he 's more interested in the plight of oppressed chinese labourers than middle-income floating voters in britain , but there was a spark of integrity and idealism in his performance that suggests tories would be unwise to write him off quite yet .", 
                "here are the key points , in addition to the ones in the material released in advance .", 
                "( see 1.50pm . )",

                "corbyn explained how he wanted labour to abandon top-down policy making .", 
                "we live in an age when we can put our views to each other in a much quicker and in a much more understandable form so we do not have to have policy making that is top down from an all-seeing , all-knowing leader who decides things .", 
                "i want everyone to bring their views forward , every union branch , every party branch , so we develop organically the strengths we all have , the ideas we all have , the imagination we all have .",

                "they are more likely to mobilise many more people around it .", 
                "so we do n't go through to 2020 with a series of surprises ; we go through to 2020 with a series of certainties , that we are a growing , stronger movement .", 
                "corbyn explained the case for broad-based policy making well .", 
                "but he glossed over how labour ( or any party ) is supposed to resolve differences when grassroots consultation does not produce a consensus .", 
                "and his call for no surprise policy making could make it hard for the party in the run-up to the election , when normally leaders want to have something new to announce .", 
                "he said that more than twice as many people voted for him in the labour leadership contest as there are conservative party members in the whole country .", 
                "he said that labour would oppose the trade union bill , not just because of its impact on unions , but because of its impact on civil liberties generally .", 
                "he said he believed it contravened the european convention on human rights .", 
                "it gives us the opportunity to defend civil liberties and traditional freedoms and explain to the wider public , beyond trade unions and others , that it is actually a threat to the liberties of all of us .", 
                "because , by calling into question the right of free association of trade unions , they are actually in contravention in my view of article 11 of the european convention on human rights they are threatening the right of peaceful protest by looking to criminalise they are even threatening the right to free speech by seeking to limit what a union member can say on social media during a dispute if they get it through , it 's a damage to the civil liberties of everybody in our society and they will use it as platform to make other attacks on other sections of our community .", 
                "he also confirmed that labour would repeal the bill if elected in 2020 .", 
                "and he claimed that it was hypocritical of the tories to champion deregulation in most areas of life while wanted to imposed extra regulations on trade unions .", 
                "he signalled that he backed calls for unions to be able to use electronic voting for workplace ballots .", 
                "he said labour would try to amend the welfare bill to abolish the benefits cap .", 
                "he said the elite overlooked the skills of working people .", 
                "the elites of our society look with contempt on people with brilliance and ideas just because they do n't speak like them or look like them .", 
                "this came at the end of an anecdote when he revealed that , as a union organiser , he always tried to find workers good at betting to take along to meetings , because they were able to calculate figures quickly in the pre-calculator days .", 
                "he backed the staff at the national gallery who have been engaged in strike action .", 
                "like the gallery itself , they were a national asset , he said .", 
                "( to understand how significant this is , it is worth pointing out that , having covered all labour leaders since tony blair , i ca n't remember any of them praising strikers in a major speech . )",
