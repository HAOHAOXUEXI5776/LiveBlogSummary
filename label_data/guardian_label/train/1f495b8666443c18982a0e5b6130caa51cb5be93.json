                "well , nick clegg has faced his party members , and one of them did ask why the lib dems were doing so badly in the polls .", 
                "but it was n't exactly a hostile grilling .", 
                "in fact , at times the q & a session was over-laudatory .", 
                "clegg did have an explanation as to why the lib dems have lost popularity ( see 3.49pm ) , although , curiously , he did not mention one obvious answer : tuition fees .", 
                "he also tried to cheer his members up by telling them that the party 's private , constituency polling suggests all is not lost .", 
                "here are the main points from today .", 
                "clegg told members that internal party polling showed that the party was doing much , much better in key seats than the national polls suggested .", 
                "he made this point during the q & a in the conference hall .", 
                "there 's only one antidote .", 
                "and that is to proudly and loudly continue to say what we 've done , and what we want to do again in the future .", 
                "here 's the good news .", 
                "whatever the national opinion polls say , where we do that on the ground where we can tell our side of the story , because no one else will , i tell you the polls look very very different , much much better , we make the weather and we 're going to win .", 
                "he announced that the government is committed to spending \u00e2\u00a3 250m a year over the next five years on camhs ( child and adolescent mental health services ) .", 
                "the move will be confirmed in next week 's budget .", 
                "( see 12.02pm . )", 
                "he criticised conservative colleagues for not being more critical of china over its handling of hong kong .", 
                "the chinese were reneging on their promise to allow free elections for the hong kong chief executive , he said .", 
                "i 've been very outspoken , much more than anyone else in government - i 'm not going to hide my frustration , but i think there 's a somewhat mealy-mouthed response from other parts of government - to say , hang on a minute , we made a very solemn commitment at the time that we would not stand idly by if the terms of the handover of hong kong to chinese sovereignty were going to be rewritten .", 
                "and they are being rewritten in a way that we do n't think confirms to the principles of democracy that we believe in and to the principles of one country , two system which underpins the whole agreement in the first place .", 
                "he said it would be a mistake not to agree to ttip ( the transatlantic trade and investment partnership , a proposed free trade deal between the eu and the us ) because britain could lose influence over world trade deals .", 
                "he said cecilia malmstroma , the european commissioner , has written to the government giving an assurance that there was nothing in ttip that could force a uk government to outsource or privatise the nhs .", 
                "but there were more important issues at stake , he said .", 
                "if i think about the world that my kids are going to inhabit , i would rather that they do n't necessarily live in a britain where all the technical standards , all the trade standards , all the rules by which we work in a globalised world are set in beijing , in latin america , the other side of the world .", 
                "i would like to think that the old world , on either side of the atlantic , that we can still get together and use our clout to set some of the rules of the game ourselves .", 
                "because power is shifting dramatically , from the old world to the new world , from the west to the east , and i just think , if we are not careful , some of our concerns about some of the details of ttip - in my view , some of the misplaced views - might unwittingly mean that we do n't enter into that agreement , and before you know it , in 20 , 30 , 40 years ' time , all the rules of the game are set by people , who are not malign necessarily , but over whom we certainly have absolutely no influence or control whatsoever .", 
                "vince cable , the business secretary , has launched a strong attack on the conservatives ' proposal for a referendum on membership of the eu .", 
                "( see 3.42pm . )", 
                "jo swinson , the minister for women , has revealed that the conservatives blocked a proposal for a review of sexism in the media .", 
                "( see 2.08pm . )", 
                "don foster , the lib dem chief whip , has said the party needs to clarify what would happen if lib dems mps want to enter a coalition after the election , but the party as a whole does not overwhelmingly support this .", 
                "the issue is particularly complicated because , under the lib dems ' triple lock rule , a coalition can only be formally agreed if certain conditions are met , and the criteria are designed to ensure that any deal must have overwhelming support .", 
                "foster said , in theory , the parliamentary party could do what it wanted .", 
                "but the issue should be clarified , he said in a q & a session just now .", 
                "this is what he said in response to gordon lishman , who asked what would happen if mps wanted a deal , but if they did not get the required two-thirds support from the party outside parliament .", 
                "in the circumstances that we are talking about you are quite right in saying that the parliamentary party is supreme in the decision it takes .", 
                "but any parliamentary party will obviously have to take into account a number of issues and it will take into account political realities above all else .", 
                "therefore i entirely accept your point that any futher clarity that could be given , for instance by the federal executive on this matter , would be of benefit to the new parliamentary party .", 
                "sal brinton , the lib dem president , said she thought that it would soon become clear in coalition talks if there was a big gap between the views of mps and the views of the party as a whole .", 
                "but she said the rule was there for a purpose ; the party insisted on the two-thirds threshold because going into coalition was a big decision which should not just be approved by a narrow majority , she said .", 
                "danny alexander , the chief secretary to the treasury , has said that his view of union leaders has become much more positive since he started working with them in government .", 
                "until i entered government my experience of dealing with trade unions was largely confined to seeing them as an aggressive and hostile campaigning wing of the labour party in my constituency but on entering government i saw the other , and much more important side , to the work of trade unions , patient , careful advocacy of the collective interests of their members .", 
                "when negotiating public sector pensions reform , he found union leaders real allies in his dealings with the tories , he said .", 
                "that 's all from me for today .", 
                "i 'll be blogging from the conference again tomorrow , and also covering george osborne and ed balls ' pre-budget interviews on the andrew marr show .",

                "i do n't think he really expects to be delivering the budget next year .", 
                "alexander 's speech did not raise the rafters - about nine people gave him a standing ovation , but the remaining 200-odd people in the audience remained firmly seated - but it includes some noteworthy lines .", 
                "here are the main points .", 
                "alexander said the lib dems wanted to make tax evasion as socially unacceptable as drink driving .", 
                "as recent weeks have shown yet again , nothing upsets law abiding tax payers more than people who think they can evade paying the tax they owe .", 
                "paying the tax you owe is n't an optional extra it 's a legal requirement .", 
                "quite rightly , benefit fiddling is a crime and a social taboo .", 
                "for too long , tax evasion has been seen by the rich and privileged more like a sport than the crime it is .", 
                "so in our future vision , they 'll be even more measures to crack down hard on the tax dodgers .", 
                "i want to see tax evasion as socially unacceptable as \u0080\u0098drink driver ' .", 
                "i want to see those who aid , abet , facilitate , or encourage tax evasion hit as hard with criminal and financial penalties as the tax evaders themselves .", 
                "that will be in our manifesto too .", 
                "he claimed that the lib dems had delivered the largest tax cuts for working people in living memory .", 
                "over the last 5 years we , the liberal democrats , have delivered the largest tax cuts for working people in living memory .", 
                "just think back to 2010 .",

                "lower taxes for 26 million working people .", 
                "( as the institute for fiscal studies pointed out yesterday , that is only true if you ignore the taxes that have gone up to fund the tax allowance increase .", 
                "i suppose you could also say the coalition has delivered the largest tax rises for working people in living memory . )",

                "the prospect of a britain under a majority conservative government is grim indeed .", 
                "and have n't we all groaned when they use their soulless mantra - long term economic plan .", 
                "the truth is their long term economic plan means long term economic pain for millions of families .", 
                "he said labour were still in denial about their role in the financial crash and that their economic policies amounted to incoherent waffle .", 
                "he said the snp had misjudged all the big calls economically .", 
                "interestingly , it also seems that the mansion tax is no longer the manison tax .",
