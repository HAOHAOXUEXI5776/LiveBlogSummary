                "the main point is that , even if all tariffs on non-eu goods were cut to zero , the overall impact on prices would be very limited .", 
                "the ifs says : simple arithmetic suggests therefore that even cutting all tariffs to zero could only reduce prices overall by 1.2 % at most .", 
                "that assumes the full 4.6 % tariff rate , that firms fully pass through the costs of existing tariffs to households , and that tariff rates are fully reflected in the prices charged by uk and eu firms .", 
                "these are strong assumptions and , in practice , the impact of tariff cuts on retail prices is likely to be less than this .", 
                "a 1.2 % price cut sounds better than nothing .", 
                "but the ifs also points out that it will not compensate for the higher prices consumers are paying because the value of the pound fell sharply after the vote to leave the eu , pushing up the price of imports .", 
                "the ifs says : as a result , cutting all tariffs to zero could reduce prices , in the short run , by a maximum of 1.2 % .", 
                "this compares with the estimated 2.0 % increase in consumer prices that resulted from the depreciation in sterling that occurred in june 2016 .", 
                "and on the today programme this morning paul johnson , the ifs director , said : we know already that the fall in the value of the pound following the brexit vote has increased prices by 2 % .", 
                "if you got rid of all tariffs , it could n't make up for that increase in prices .", 
                "the ifs also points out the after brexit the government would not want to cut eliminate all tariffs anyway .", 
                "cutting all tariffs could harm some parts of domestic industry that 's why nearly all countries maintain at least some tariffs unilateral tariff reductions would also rob the uk of bargaining chips in future trade negotiations , potentially limiting the uk 's ability to obtain greater access to overseas export markets .", 
                "and we could only gain control over these tariffs by leaving the customs union a move which would make trade with the eu , by far our most important trading partner , more expensive .",
