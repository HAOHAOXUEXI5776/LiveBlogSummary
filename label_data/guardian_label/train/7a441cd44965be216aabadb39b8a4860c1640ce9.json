                "that was one of the less revelatory committee hearings we 've had on brexit .", 
                "that may be because the committee was pressed for time , and with the chair trying to let a large number of peers have a say , there was not much time for proper follow-up questions .",

                "davis suggested that , because ministers are now talking about accepting some aspects of eu membership during a post-brexit transitional phase , that was being seen as a watering down of the government 's position .",

                "and it was the transitional period that was leading to mistaken claims that the uk was watering down its stance , he claimed .",

                "he argued that theresa may 's offer to other parties to bring forward policy ideas was creating a very british version of a german grand coalition '' with jeremy corbyn 's labour over brexit : of course it is ludicrously implausible to imagine mr corbyn going to the rose garden and signing up as a deputy prime minister but nonetheless there is a coalition of interest on the big issue of the day and if they are determined to discipline their own parties and force through this hard brexit option -that is the thing that will make him happen .", 
                "as far as my party is concerned that leaves us in the right and potentially in a strong position .", 
                "cable reiterated his belief that brexit may not happen arguing that issues like euratom that people had n't thought of would cause problems .",

                "he said there were 20-25 % of people who shared his party 's values as outward looking , liberal , instinctively supportive of a mixed economy pro business but support public services '' .", 
                "cable argued that his party got almost all those votes in 2010 but since fell well short , saying his priority was to target those voters again by differentiating the lib dems from the tories and labour .", 
                "ten years ' work by david cameron to detoxify the brand has been trashed by what they are now doing , clinging to power , the dup .",

                "and sure , we have recovered , we are walking around , the economy has many elements to the norm - but almost 10 years later we are still attached to a life support system - which is ultra cheap money - without historical precedent .", 
                "on a second brexit vote , cable said : it may well be at the end of the day if there were a second referendum a majority of people would say ok to brexit and that would kill the issue forever .", 
                "on the voters who backed brexit , cable said : i spent most of the referendum campaign in the south - church halls in hampshire and dorset and they were overwhelmingly elderly people who were obsessed with the worry of 80m turks coming to live in their village .",
