                "at 8am , today junior doctors begin the first in a series of three strikes over planned changes to their contract the first walkout by junior doctors in 40 years .", 
                "the dispute between the british medical association , which represents 38,000 of the 45,000 junior doctors in england , and the health secretary , jeremy hunt , has become increasingly embittered and this time , unlike when a previous walkout was planned for 1 december , there has been no last-minute reprieve .", 
                "on monday , nhs england said that 1,425 inpatient operations and procedures had been cancelled as a result of the strike alongside 2,535 outpatient ones .", 
                "it said that 3,400 of the cancellations were today and 654 192 inpatients and 462 day cases are in london .", 
                "the postponed operations amount to about 13 % of the normal daily total of 30,000 .", 
                "across greater manchester , more than half ( 54 % ) of planned surgeries and non-urgent day-cases have been cancelled .", 
                "approximately 11 % outpatient appointments have also been cancelled .", 
                "emergency care is excluded from today 's industrial action but is likely to be affected nevertheless with nhs england saying hospitals would generally be under additional pressure .", 
                "there are believed to be about 100 at least , planned for outside hospitals .", 
                "we will be providing live updates from lines and on how the nhs is coping at a time when increased winter demand has already put a strain on services ."
