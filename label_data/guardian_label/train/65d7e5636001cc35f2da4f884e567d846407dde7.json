                "sir john major , the conservative former prime minister , has used a rare intervention in domestic politics to urge theresa may to allow mps a free vote on the final brexit deal .", 
                "( see 2.39pm . )", 
                "major , whose own premiership was undermined by constant criticism from tory eurosceptics and who campaigned passionately for remain , used a major speech to deliver a damning verdict on the government 's handling of brexit .", 
                "its aims were just not credible '' , he said .", 
                "( see 2.22pm . )", 
                "he said mps should be given a free vote on the final brexit deal , implying that calling a second referendum or rejecting brexit outright should both be options .", 
                "major said that parliamentarians had to consider , not just the will of the people , but their wellbeing too .", 
                "he implied that a soft brexit , involving britain being in the single market like norway , would be the best and most acceptable compromise solution , but he also hinted that he thought there was a case for reversing brexit and staying in the eu for good .", 
                "( see 2.18pm and 2.34pm . )", 
                "since his election defeat in 1997 major has normally been loyal to his party and its leader , but today 's speech has infuriated tory brexiters ( see 5.21pm ) and will embolden his party 's pro-europeans , as well as those ( mostly in the lib dems ) calling for a second referendum .", 
                "but major made it clear that he personally did not favour a second referendum ; he wants parliament to take the final decision .", 
                "( see 2.43pm . )", 
                "and his call for a free vote is likely to be a non-starter .", 
                "may and jeremy corbyn would be most unlikely to agree to such an idea ( which runs counter to the whole tradition of using party as a basis for organising in the commons - something to which party leaders , for obvious reasons , are rather attached . )", 
                "also , major did not seem very clear as to what the free vote would be on .", 
                "( see 2.39pm . )", 
                "he seemed to imply that various options should be considered .", 
                "but parliamentary votes need to be binary .", 
                "when labour offered mps a choice of options on lords reform in 2003 , it was a disaster because all seven options were rejected .", 
                "the eu 's chief negotiator , michel barnier , has conceded that border checks within the uk may be necessary in the future as brussels published a draft withdrawal agreement under which the northern ireland would effectively stay in the single market and customs union after brexit .", 
                "at pmqs theresa may said the draft in its current form was unacceptable .", 
                "in reply to the dup mp david simpson , she said : the draft legal text that the commission has published would , if implemented , undermine the uk common market and threaten the constitutional integrity of the uk by creating a customs and regulatory border down the irish sea , and no uk prime minister could ever agree to it .", 
                "i will be making it crystal clear to president juncker and others that we will never do so .", 
                "we are committed to ensuring that we see no hard border between northern ireland and ireland , but the december text also made it clear that there should continue to be trade between northern ireland and the rest of the united kingdom , as there is today .", 
                "the irish government has said the uk needs to come up with alternative solutions if it will not support the eu 's legal document on brexit .", 
                "speaking in the dail , leo varadkar , the irish prime minister , said : hardline brexiteers and some politicians in northern ireland will say 'no ' and will be angry at what they see today , but just saying 'no ' and being angry is not enough .", 
                "if people do not like what they see today , it is incumbent on them to come up with alternative solutions and to flesh out option a and option b , write it down in a legal form that can be enforced and then we can negotiate on that .", 
                "theresa may has conceded that new eu migrants who come to britain during the brexit transition will have the right to settle permanently in the uk , in a major climbdown over future residency rights .", 
                "boris johnson has faced accusations of cowardice and discourtesy from labour mps after he failed to appear in the commons to answer an urgent question about reports that he privately argued a hard irish border was possible after brexit .", 
                "ministers have rejected a call from mps to immediately suspend the disclosure of confidential nhs patient data to the home office to trace potential immigration offenders despite evidence it is deterring migrants in england from seeking medical help .", 
                "labour will no longer accept donations from the privacy campaigner max mosleyfollowing accusations that he published a leaflet in the 1960s linking immigrants with tuberculosis and leprosy , jeremy corbyn 's spokesman has said .", 
                "that 's all from me for today .",
