                "i am going to leave it you , dear readers , to decide who won the debate , but here are the key arguments and takeaways from penny wong and cory bernardi : wong is of the view it is discriminatory to not allow same-sex couples to marry , and means they are not seen as equal .",

                "we could end up with polygamous marriage , and as an aside wong does not support real equality if she does not support polygamous marriage .",
