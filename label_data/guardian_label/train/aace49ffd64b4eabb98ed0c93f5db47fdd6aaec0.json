                "liz kendall , the shadow health minister , has become the first person to formally announce that she is running for the labour leadership .", 
                "in a well-received interview with andrew neil , she said that labour lost partly because it was too negative , sounding like a moaning man in the pub '' .", 
                "she told the programme : we did n't get people 's trust on the economy , we did n't build a broad enough coalition of voters in different parts of the country and we did n't set out a positive enough alternative for the future .", 
                "it 's not enough to just critique what 's going [ on ] under this government , but actually you 've got to set out something people can believe in that 's going to give them hope and confidence in the future i 've argued for quite a long while that we 've got to set out something positive and not just be the kind of moaning man in the pub .", 
                "asked if she agreed with lord mandelson that it had been a mistake to ditch new labour , she replied : the words new labour mean different things to different people and i think going back to the past is n't what we need .", 
                "we 're going to have to build something genuinely new in the future , but if what he meant by that is we 've got to keep our working class voters and support but also reach out to conservative supporters and middle england , that 's absolutely right .", 
                "that 's just a fact that that 's what you 've got to do to win and i think we lost some of that .", 
                "a labour mp and member of the party 's national executive committee , jon ashworth , has called for the party 's leadership ballot to take place after the autumn conference .", 
                "( see 3.06pm . )", 
                "and paul kenny , the gmb leader , has said the contest should not be rushed .", 
                "( see 2.57pm . )", 
                "lady williams , the former lib dem leader in the lords , has complained that party funding rules allowed big parties like the tories to buy the election .", 
                "speaking on the world this weekend , she said that the election involved the selling of democracy '' because the rules limiting spending in individual constituencies only apply for a limited period before the actual election .", 
                "she said : there was a decapitation strategy on the conservative side , and then also on labour 's side , like for example the extraordinary targeting of simon hughes , long-standing and much beloved member of parliament for bermondsey .", 
                "so i think what one 's looking at is not just the normal swings and balances of politics .", 
                "i think we 're looking at something much worse , which is what i 've seen in the united states as a harvard professor on the subject , namely the selling of democracy .", 
                "the sums that were poured into this election exceed by a very long mark any of the amounts spent in recent elections , a huge mistake when you put in for a fixed-term parliament and did not put in for a much longer period of regulated finance .", 
                "it simply floods out most of the earlier expenditure on elections since , i would say , right back to attlee 's time .", 
                "and it does have an impact .", 
                "douglas carswell , ukip 's only mp , has said that ukip 's future lies in replacing labour .", 
                "speaking on the sunday politics , he said : ukip 's future lies in replacing a corporatist labour party .", 
                "it is significant we came second in 120 seats , many of those seats in the north of england .", 
                "the disaffection people in scotland clearly feel towards the labour party does n't stop at the border .", 
                "it continues all the way down into the old labour heartland .", 
                "i think there is a tremendous future for ukip in displacing the labour party with a sort of radical popular capitalism .", 
                "you are not going to get any real alternative from the remains of keir hardie 's party .", 
                "i 'm convinced as a free marketer there is a case for the free market , the case for popular capitalism , has never been easier to make - the problem is the corporatist system we have in this country is giving capitalism a bad name .", 
                "there is a huge space in the political ecology for a genuine radical , populist free market alternative that is not in cahoots with big business and corporatism .", 
                "that 's all from me for today .",
