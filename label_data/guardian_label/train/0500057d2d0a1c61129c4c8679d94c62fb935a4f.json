                "in 1972 pell said he became aware of allegations monsignor john day had been sexually abusing children .", 
                "but he was also aware day had denied the allegations .", 
                "the latter half of pell 's evidence on monday morning was dominated by interrogation over his knowledge of offending by christian brothers at st alipius primary school and st patrick 's college in ballarat in the early 1970s .", 
                "it was , pell said , common knowledge that staff swimming naked with young boys had occurred .", 
                "pell said the incident was unusual , and an imprudent act but no improprieties were every alleged to me .", 
                "he agreed that sexual offending at the school 's was known to a significant number of people in the community .",
