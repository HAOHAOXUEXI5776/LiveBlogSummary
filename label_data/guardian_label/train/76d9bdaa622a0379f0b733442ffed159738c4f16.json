                "the consensus view , that centrist emmanuel macron would beat le pen in the second round in early may , is looking shaky .", 
                "with right-winger francois fillon and communist-backed jean-luc melenchon both gaining ground , it 's hard to say exactly who 'll claim the prized top two places on sunday .", 
                "the prospect of le pen and melenchon contesting the run-off is causing some jitters in the city .", 
                "as correspondent angelique chrisafis reports from paris , tension is mounting among macron 's team too : the independent centrist , who is running in his first election , had been seen as a frontrunner but faces a gruelling final few days before the first-round presidential vote this sunday .", 
                "styling himself as a pro-europe progressive , he went from dark-horse outsider to favourite three months ago .", 
                "but as polls narrow and a third of the electorate remains undecided , the race has become increasingly uncertain .", 
                "macron 's supporters concede that the last few days of campaigning will be tough and unpredictable .", 
                "although polls have shown he could win a second round runoff on 7 may , macron first has to make it to the final round - and that is not by any means guaranteed .", 
                "the new president , '' said one butcher as he posed for a selfie with macron at the market .",

                "that shock decision sent the pound to a six month high last night , but also wiped \u00a3 46bn off the ftse 100 .", 
                "the city 's snap reaction is that theresa may will claim a large majority , strengthening her hand in the brexit talks , and removing the chance of being derailed by either pro-remain mps or hard-line eurosceptics .", 
                "that could cut the chances of her final deal being rejected by parliament .", 
                "but it does n't necessarily mean britain gets a better deal .", 
                "as our financial editor nils pratley says , the brexit talks will still be tough : if delivering a successful '' brexit involves making a few pragmatic compromises - which is surely the lesson from the initial skirmishes with the eu negotiators - you ca n't blame may for seeking cover from the hard-liners in her own party .", 
                "and kicking out the next election until 2022 seems a smart political move : it would allow time for a three-year transitional phase before uk voters go back to the polls , which could take the edge off any economic shock at the moment of brexit in 2019 .", 
                "so , yes , it was fair for investors to take some comfort in the idea that a market-friendly soft '' brexit is now easier to imagine .",
