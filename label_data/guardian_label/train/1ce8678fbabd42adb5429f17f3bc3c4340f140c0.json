                "meanwhile , average hourly earnings growth is still very subdued and the near-term momentum in core pce inflation has been very weak .", 
                "with the us dollar continuing to rise on a trade weighted basis , and downside risks to global growth emanating from emerging markets increasing , inflation is unlikely to move up to its 2 % target quickly enough to justify tightening policy .", 
                "indeed , a premature rate rise would damage the recovery as well as the fed 's inflation credibility .", 
                "recent advocates for this view have been charles evans from the chicago fed and eric rosengren from the boston fed , the two most dovish members of the committee .", 
                "a centrist would take a different tack .",

                "along with the still high levels of business and consumer sentiment , they would recommend looking through some of the near-term weakness in the hard data , arguing that it was likely to be mainly due to the temporary effects of bad weather , or the fact that in the short-term lower oil prices constrains investment more than it boosts other components of gdp .", 
                "on the foreign front , they would be mindful of the rise in the dollar , but also observe that growth has been improving in europe and japan , underpinned by significant monetary easing so what might fed chair janet yellen do ?", 
                "i think that she will find the arguments to remove the patient language compelling .", 
                "i also suspect that she will be comforted by the strength of the improvement in the labour market , and will not yet be alarmed by the downside surprises to some of the key hard data in recent months .", 
                "that said , she also takes the inflation side of the fed 's mandate seriously and will not like the optics of tightening policy at a time when core pce inflation is declining .", 
                "she will recognise that the ongoing rise in the dollar means that core goods price inflation will probably weaken further .", 
                "thus , while she will want to keep a june increase on the table , she will want to see more evidence that forward looking inflation indicators are moving in the right direction before pulling the trigger .",
