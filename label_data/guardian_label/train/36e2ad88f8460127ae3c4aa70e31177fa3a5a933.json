                "mps on the commons treasury committee have cast doubt on george osborne 's claim to have halved the \u00a3 1.7bn budget bill that the eu demanded in october .", 
                "osborne told the committee that his claim was justified because initially it was not clear that the british budget rebate would apply to the \u00a3 1.7bn sum .", 
                "but andrew tyrie , the conservative mp who chairs the committee , said , although osborne did well to negotiate an interest-free delay before britain had to pay up , the size of the bill did n't change a scrap '' because the rebate was never in doubt .", 
                "he told osborne : actually getting a delay , an interest-free delay , is a considerable achievement , and worth something .", 
                "but that strong message , i ca n't help feeling , has been somewhat distorted by a claim that we got 50 % back of this extra payment when it seems clear , as soon as you start looking at the rules , that money was coming anyway i 'm not sure that the deal you said you brought back was quite as good as the one that in fact was achieved by those negotiations .", 
                "other mps on the committee were also sceptical of osborne 's claims , and one conservative , steve baker , suggested that osborne 's claim could make people less likely to believe the government when it did secure a good deal from brussels .", 
                "osborne has said that , if labour votes for the government 's charter for budget responsibility but refuses to accepts osborne 's spending cuts , it will have to explain what taxes would have to go up to fund the \u00a3 30bn savings the charter requires .", 
                "osborne has defended his decision to aim for a \u00a3 23bn surplus in 209-20 .", 
                "a report has said he controversial system for assessing people for the personal independence payment ( pip ) gives a disjointed experience '' for claimants , with many experiencing very long delays '' .", 
                "as the press assocation reports , in his first independent review of the scheme , former senior civil servant paul gray said it was too early to draw conclusions about the scheme 's effectiveness but he called for improvements in communication with claimants and the way evidence is collected .", 
                "the document was published as the latest quarterly figures showed 208,000 pip claims were being paid at the end of october , a 95 % increase on the figure for july , but charities said thousands of ill or disabled people were still awaiting assessment .", 
                "the gray report said : the current pip process gives a disjointed experience for claimants .", 
                "some short term improvements are needed , for example to communications including decision letters .", 
                "in the longer term , there should be a more integrated , digitally enabled claims process under common branding that would improve claimant experience and effectiveness .", 
                "the british parliament 's intelligence and security committee ( isc ) has started to question intelligence agencies over whether they requested redactions in the explosive us senate report on cia torture .", 
                "that 's all from me for today .",
