                "sanctions experts said the new measures appeared to be in line with the obama administration 's approach of incrementally expanding sanctions as procurement and influence networks are uncovered , but a senior trump administration official said the decision to impose the new sanctions had been triggered by the 29 january iranian test of a medium-range ballistic missile .", 
                "the sanctions were also declared to be in retaliation for a houthi attack on a saudi warship on 31 january .",

                "the people and companies targeted in the new sanctions list are suspected of being parts of networks that import dual-use items that have been used in iran 's nuclear programme , or transfer funds abroad for iran 's revolutionary guards to foreign armed groups .", 
                "the measures do not reimpose any sanctions that were lifted as a result of the 2015 nuclear agreement with iran .", 
                "it is an appropriate response and consistent with the approach that the obama administration took in dealing with missiles and terror , said elizabeth rosenberg , a former senior sanctions adviser at the treasury department .",

                "i would n't have expected a president clinton to act any differently .", 
                "us officials said that the missile test was inconsistent with un security council resolution 2231 , which endorsed the 2015 nuclear deal and calls on iran not to develop or test missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons but does not ban such activity outright .", 
                "the iranian defence minister , hossein dehghan , has insisted that the 29 january test did not violate the resolution and declared : we will not allow foreigners to interfere in our defence affairs .", 
                "a senior administration official insisted on friday that the tested missile was nuclear-capable .", 
                "those are ballistic missiles that can travel a certain distance and carry a certain payload and this ballistic missile falls within that parameter , the official said .", 
                "michael elleman , a missile expert at the international institute for strategic studies , said it was not clear what iran had launched , but said most likely it was a shahab-3 medium-range ballistic missile based on the north korean nodong missile , and which was first tested in 1998 .", 
                "trump 's attempt to shock and awe both allies and adversaries in his first two weeks in office has deepened global uncertainty as trump has taken an abrasive approach to diplomacy from australia to mexico .",

                "it also emerged that more than 100,000 visas may have been revoked as a result of trump 's fiercely contentious ban on travel from seven muslim-majority countries .", 
                "the number was revealed by a government attorney during a lawsuit brought on behalf of two yemeni brothers who arrived at dulles international airport near washington on saturday , only to be put on a return flight to ethiopia .", 
                "but the state department contradicted the attorney 's figure , saying that fewer than 60,000 visas had been cancelled under trump 's order .", 
                "in a highly provocative move last month , trump signed an executive order that affects people holding passports from iran , iraq , libya , somalia , sudan , syria and yemen , and also halts temporarily the entry of refugees into the country .",

                "criticism of the white house 's misrepresentation of the issue intensified after kellyanne conway , counselor to trump , was forced to issue a correction after blaming two iraqi refugees for a massacre that never happened .", 
                "conway cited the fictitious bowling green massacre in an interview in which she backed the travel ban .", 
                "interviewed by chris matthews on msnbc 's hardball programme on thursday evening , conway compared the executive order issued by trump in his first week in the white house to what she described as a six-month ban imposed by his predecessor , barack obama .", 
                "this claim has been debunked by commentators who have pointed out that the 2011 action was a pause on the processing of refugees from iraq after two iraqi nationals were arrested over a failed attempt to send money and weapons to al-qaida in iraq .", 
                "conway told matthews : i bet it 's brand new information to people that president obama had a six-month ban on the iraqi refugee program after two iraqis came here to this country , were radicalised and they were the masterminds behind the bowling green massacre .", 
                "most people do n't know that because it did n't get covered .", 
                "the two iraqi men arrested in 2011 did live in bowling green , kentucky , and arecurrently serving life sentences for federal terrorism offences .",
