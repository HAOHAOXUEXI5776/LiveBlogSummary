            "text": [
                "nigel farage , who we discovered yesterday remains ukip leader , has made an interesting intervention in his party 's new leadership contest .", 
                "writing in today 's telegraph , he says the party should a leader best able to win over labour voters .", 
                "there are some other lines in the article too .", 
                "here is a summary .", 
                "farage says ukip should focus on gaining votes from labour and a leader best able to do this .", 
                "over the last couple of years we have impacted the labour vote in a way that very few commentators predicted .", 
                "it was in many traditional labour constituencies that a surprisingly large number of brexit votes were delivered on june 23 .", 
                "in areas like the midlands , the north of england and wales a large number of life-long labour voters opted for brexit .", 
                "they have now been cast aside by their own party denounced as racists by diane abbott and told by mr corbyn that there should be no limits on the number of people coming to britain .", 
                "i believe that ukip can talk to these people , that the party must now target this old labour vote and choose a leader fit for that purpose .", 
                "as my colleague rowena mason writes , there are five potential candidates for the ukip leadership .", 
                "farage 's comments suggest he wants the party to either paul nuttall , the former deputy leader who has spoken repeatedly about the need for ukip to chase labour votes , or steven woolfe .", 
                "both are meps for the north west of england .", 
                "he claimed nearly every line in theresa may 's conservative conference speech yesterday echoed what he had said in his own speeches .", 
                "this showed how much politics had changed , he said .", 
                "to listen to theresa may 's first speech to the tory party conference as prime minister is to marvel at the seismic change in british politics in 2016 .", 
                "ukip has not just pushed for , gained and helped to win a national referendum ; more than that , we have changed the entire national debate .", 
                "indeed , the centre of gravity has shifted so much that nearly every line in mrs may 's speech echoed my own at ukip conferences over the years .", 
                "he rejected claims that ukip no longer had a purpose in politics .", 
                "ukip had to ensure the government delivered on brexit , he said .", 
                "i accept there will be many tories cheering mrs may 's words today .", 
                "some of them will have voted ukip in the 2014 european elections .", 
                "the danger that she now faces is one of raised expectations on the eu , immigration and grammar schools .", 
                "if she delivers , her position will be unassailable in 2020 .", 
                "but if she falters , if brexit is not seen to have been delivered , then there will be a deep wave of tory disappointment .", 
                "it is worth remembering that as home secretary she talked tough on immigration and utterly failed to deliver .", 
                "either way , it is vital for the 17.4 million brexit voters that we have a strong ukip voice to challenge the government throughout this journey to our nation 's independence outside of the eu .", 
                "if by the time of the next election we do not have our british passports back and have not reclaimed our territorial fishing waters , then the june 2016 referendum will be unfinished business .", 
                "he said if theresa may failed to deliver , ukip could go into the 2020 general election in a stronger position than at any point in its history .", 
                "he joked about the fact that he was technically still ukip leader , because diane james 's election as leader was never ratified by the electoral commission .", 
                "i feel rather like an escapee who has been recaptured , but no matter , he said .", 
                "he said he would remain as ukip leader until a new one was elected .", 
                "he would not be standing himself , he said .", 
                "nigel farage with diane james , who resigned after 18 days as leader , triggering a new leadership contest .",
