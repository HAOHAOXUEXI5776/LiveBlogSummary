                "at its december meeting the ecb decided to extend the programme by nine months to december 2017 but cut the monthly amount of bonds bought from \u0082\u00ac80bn to \u0082\u00ac60bn , but there were some differences of opinion according to the just-released minutes .",

                "and it meant that if the recovery faltered the decision could be reversed .", 
                "the minutes said : at the same time , if the outlook became less favourable , or if financial conditions became inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment of the inflation path , the governing council could return to a pace of \u0082\u00ac80 billion per month .", 
                "so although the change was eventually implemented , some members remained opposed : a few members could not support either of the two options that had been proposed , while welcoming the scaling-down of purchases and other elements of the proposals , in view of their well-known general scepticism regarding the app [ asset purchase programme ] and public debt purchases in particular .",
