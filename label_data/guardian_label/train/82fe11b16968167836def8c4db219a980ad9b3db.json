                "david cameron has said that calling islamic state islamic state is offensive '' to many muslims .", 
                "he was speaking in response to a question from the snp leader at westminster , angus robertson , who said that the time has come in the english-speaking world to stop using islamic state , isis or isil '' and that instead government and the media should use the term da'esh .", 
                "in response , cameron went slightly further then he did when he raised this issue on the today programme this morning .", 
                "( see 9.16am . )", 
                "he said islamic state was an offensive term .", 
                "i agree with the honourable gentleman on the use of the term islamic state .", 
                "i think this is seen as particularly offensive to many muslims who see , as i see , not a state but a barbaric regime of terrorism and oppression that takes delight in murder and oppressing women and murdering people because they 're gay .", 
                "so i raised this with the bbc this morning .", 
                "i personally think that using the term isil or 'so called ' would be better than what they currently do .", 
                "i do n't think we 'll move them all the way to da'esh , so i think saying isil is probably better than islamic state because it is neither , in my view , islamic or a state .", 
                "he announced that there will be a national one minute 's silence on friday at 12pm to honour those killed in tunisia .", 
                "he said that there would be a major training exercise in london over the next two days to test britain 's preparedness for a serious terrorist attack .", 
                "downing street later said the initiative had been planned in the wake of the charlie hebdo murders in paris .", 
                "he said that it was thought the killer in tunisa could be part of an isil-inspired network '' .", 
                "tunisian security forces were investigating possible accomplices , he said .", 
                "harriet harman , labour 's acting leader , mocked cameron over the apparent vagueness of his eu renegotiation demands .", 
                "she said : of course negotiations are sensitive but it 's evident that even the people you are negotiating with are not entirely clear what you are negotiating for .", 
                "but nor are the british people you are negotiating on behalf of .", 
                "in his statement cameron said he was looking for substantive reform '' in four areas : sovereignty , fairness , immigration and fairness .", 
                "he explained : first on sovereignty , britain will not support being part of an ever-closer union or being dragged into a state called europe .", 
                "that may be for others , but it will never be for britain , and it is time to recognise that specifically .", 
                "we want national parliaments to be able to work together to have more power , not less .", 
                "second on fairness .", 
                "as the eurozone integrates further , the eu has got to be flexible enough to make sure the interests of both those inside and outside the eurozone are fairly balanced .", 
                "put simply , the single currency is not for all but the single market and the european union as a whole must work for all .", 
                "third on immigration , we need to tackle the welfare incentives that attract so many people from across the eu to seek work in britain .", 
                "and finally , alongside all these , we need to make the eu a source of growth , jobs , innovation and success rather than stagnation .", 
                "that means signing trade deals and completing the single market - such as in digital , where the council made progress towards a roaming agreement that could cut the cost of mobile phone bills for businesses and tourists alike .", 
                "that 's all from me for today .",

                "joshua rozenberg , the legal commentator , has written an excellent article for comment is free on the legal issues that led to the crown prosecution service reversing its original decision and deciding it will now prosecute lord janner .", 
                "he says that the only difference between alison saunders , the director of public prosecutions who originally decided janner should not face trial , and david perry qc , who effectively reversed this when he reviewed her decision , was over whether or not a trial of facts would be in the public interest .", 
                "but this is a decision saunders should be taking , not perry , he says .",

                "there is no disagreement about the likely outcome - which will probably still be an absolute discharge if the case gets that far .", 
                "but perry appears to have taken the view that the decision-making process - and the evidence of janner 's dementia - need to be put to a court for all the world to see .", 
                "in his view , the long-awaited and much-delayed goddard child abuse inquiry is no substitute for an adjudication by the courts .",

                "perry has often been briefed to advise on whether there is sufficient evidence to justify bringing specific charges .", 
                "but decisions on whether a specific prosecution would be in the public interest are normally taken in house by cps lawyers .", 
                "so saunders has been forced by her own policies to subcontract a judgment that she was better equipped to make .",

                "it will be interesting to see whether the courts allow the case to proceed as far as a trial of the facts .", 
                "janner 's lawyers are likely to argue that this would be an abuse of process .", 
                "and the courts may stop the case if it concludes that the former mp is unfit to plead .", 
                "whatever happens , it is highly unlikely that janner will ever be seen in court - not even at the hearing currently listed for 7 august ."
