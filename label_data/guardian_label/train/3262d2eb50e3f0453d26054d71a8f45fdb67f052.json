                "donald trump has been roundly denounced by mps from all parties in a debate in the british parliament .", 
                "but most of those mps who spoke were critical of the call in a petition signed by 575,000 people for trump to be banned from the uk because of his proposal for muslims to be prevented from entering the us and the debate , which took place in an annex outside the main commons chamber , ended without a vote .", 
                "one of the functions of a parliament is allow a nation to let off steam and effectively that is what happened this afternoon .", 
                "many of the speeches were passionate , and the best from someone in favour of trump being banned probably came from jack dromey , a labour shadow home office minister ( although not on this occasion presenting the official labour party view ) .", 
                "dromey said trump would fuel extremism if he came to the uk .", 
                "isis needs donald trump and donald trump need isis , he claimed .", 
                "but most mps argued that a ban would be disproportionate and counter-productive , and there were particularly good speeches on this side from labour 's naz shah and from the conservatives sir edward leigh , victoria atkins and kwarsi kwarteng .", 
                "the government is firmly opposed to a ban and , summing up , the home office minister james brokenshire said that the us was britain 's most important partner .", 
                "it is in the uk 's interests that we engage all presidential candidates , democratic and republican , even though we may disagree profoundly on important issues .", 
                "where there are clear differences of opinion , the most effective way to influence our america partners is through a frank and open exchange of views , in taking on those arguments .", 
                "and today 's robust debate has , i think , provided a platform to do just that .", 
                "but this seemed a touch panglossian .", 
                "the debate did illustrate just how feared and extreme trump is as a presidential candidate , although any british mps who think that diatribes against him in the house of commons will hold him back are probably misguided .", 
                "some mps seemed to question the merits of having the debate at all .", 
                "paul flynn 's opening speech was unfocused and rather rambling , but he made a very perceptive point when he questioned what the debate would actually achieve .", 
                "we may already be in error in giving [ trump ] far too much attention , he said .",

                "there probably wo n't be any vote at all , and even if there is , it will be on a procedural matter ( that this house has considered the matter etc ) , not on a ban .", 
                "and , third , even if mps did vote to ban trump , it would not happen because the government is against the idea .", 
                "so why is the debate taking place ?", 
                "because the house of commons has a procedure that ensures online petitions that attract more than 100,000 signatures get debated in parliament .", 
                "at the last count , almost 575,000 people had signed the one saying trump should be banned from the uk .", 
                "technically mps will also be debating a separate petition saying banning trump would be totally illogical but that has only attracted 43,000 signatures .", 
                "in practical terms , then , this is a bit of a non-event .", 
                "but symbolically , for what it says about the polarisation of opinion in the us and what relations between washington and the rest of the world would be like in the event of trump becoming president , this is a big moment .", 
                "british politicians follow american politics quite closely but the senior ones almost never express an opinion in public about the us presidential elections because that is deemed as inappropriate .", 
                "yet , from david cameron downwards , they have been happy to condemn trump 's comments about muslims , and this afternoon parliament has set time aside to allow mps to do so formally .", 
                "this has never happened before in modern times in relation to a leading presidential candidate and it shows just how extreme and unpalatable trump is to the british political establishment .", 
                "here is our preview story .", 
                "mps to debate banning donald trump from uk in wake of petition read more and here is video footage of paul flynn , the backbench labour mp who will speak first in this afternoon 's debate , explaining what he is going to say .", 
                "if you want to follow me or contact me on twitter , i 'm on @ andrewsparrow .", 
                "i try to monitor the comments btl but normally i find it impossible to read them all .", 
                "if you have a direct question , do include andrew in it somewhere and i 'm more likely to find it .", 
                "i do try to answer direct questions , although sometimes i miss them or do n't have time .", 
                "alternatively you could post a question to me on twitter ."
