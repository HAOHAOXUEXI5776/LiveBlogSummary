                "downing street accused rail workers and other workers on strike of causing untold misery '' and showing contempt '' for ordinary people .", 
                "asked about the strikes affecting southern rail , the post office and british airways , the prime minister 's spokesman condemned them in unusually strong terms .", 
                "he told journalists .", 
                "what the prime minister thinks is that the strikes are wrong and that they are causing untold misery to hundreds of thousands of people .", 
                "there are hundreds of thousands of people having their lives disrupted on a massively unwarranted scale by these strikes if [ these strikes ] have anything in common , it is shared contempt for ordinary people trying to go about their daily lives [ the unions ' ] actions are clearly designed to bring about maximum damage and disruption during the festive period .", 
                "asked about the possibility of toughening up strike legislation , the spokesman said : nothing will be ruled out . ''", 
                "but he also pointed out that the government has just passed a trade union act that is coming into force next year which will impose new thresholds for strikes .", 
                "and , when asked if may was actively looking at the possibility of new legislation , he said her focus now was on getting the current strikes settled .", 
                "michael fallon , the defence secretary , will make a statement to mps about defence exports this afternoon .", 
                "number 10 would not say what fallon will be announce , but the spokesman suggested that it was linked to today 's guardian story saying ministers have seen government analysis indicating that uk-made cluster munitions were used by the saudi-led coalition in the current conflict in yemen .", 
                "the statement will come after theresa may 's on the eu summit and liz truss 's on the birmingham prison riot , meaning that it will not start until around 6pm .", 
                "number 10 ruled out negotiating a separate brexit deal for scotland .", 
                "tomorrow the scottish government will publish plans for further devolution to scotland that it says would allow scotland to remain in the single market after brexit while the rest of the uk left .", 
                "but the prime minister 's spokesman said the government was opposed to scotland getting its own deal .", 
                "he said : we are committed to leaving the european union and getting a deal that works for the uk as a whole we are of the opinion that we will get the best deal for the uk if the uk is unified in its response the referendum decision was taken by the uk as a whole .", 
                "we will leave the european union as a whole .", 
                "downing street said that liam fox , the international trade secretary , was right to float the idea of britain remaining partly in the customs union as a possible brexit outcome .", 
                "the spokesman said that fox 's comments in an interview with andrew marr yesterday ( see 9.19am ) simply reflected what david davis , the brexit secretary , has said about customs union membership not being a binary choice '' and about a spectrum of options '' being available .", 
                "( this is noteworthy because in the past some of fox 's brexit comments , like this one , or this one , have been disowned by number 10 . )", 
                "number 10 refused to say whether may thinks eu countries will try to delay offering the uk a brexit transition deal so as to encourage british banks to move to the continent .", 
                "this claim is made in today 's financial times splash which says : british chancellor philip hammond said this month that he wanted to discuss an interim deal early on in the negotiations '' to reassure the city of london that there would be no regulatory cliff-edge in march 2019 , the date set for britain 's exit from the union .", 
                "but the first priority of michel barnier , chief eu negotiator , is to sort out the terms of the divorce .", 
                "this means britain must offer assurances on issues such as the rights of eu expats and paying an exit bill of up to \u20ac60bn before a deal on a soft landing '' is possible .", 
                "senior eu diplomats admit the timetable also reflects a cold calculation of interests : delaying agreement on a transition would spur companies to move some of their business to the eu to cope with the danger of a hard exit .", 
                "british officials fear brussels may hold out for a transitional deal so long that many banks will have already taken crucial decisions to leave the uk .", 
                "asked about this story , the prime minister 's spokesman said britain would be going into the negotiations in a spirit of goodwill '' .", 
                "asked if may was worried that eu negotiators would hold up a transitional deal out of self interest , he replied : it is not for me to second-guess the motives of our [ eu ] colleagues . ''", 
                "neil henderson ( @ hendopolis ) ft : fears eu delays on brexit talks will spur exodus of banks to eurozone # tomorrowspaperstoday # bbcpapers britain is holding a round of talks with argentina this week through the framework of the new south atlantic dialogue .",

                "thursday 's summit was a relatively dull one , and britain 's departure from the eu was n't officially on the agenda , but brexit is the black hole of british politics , sucking in everything else through its immense gravitational pull , and this afternoon 's statement may well end up being a brexit q & a .",

                "but he went on : what i think is more difficult to contemplate is the idea that you have cars inside but some sort of widgets outside .", 
                "the idea is that cars which we care about , aerospace which we care about , financial services which we care about , would n't it be great if they were in the customs union .", 
                "would that be legal under the wto ( world trade organisation ) ?", 
                "i doubt , even if we got away with it i do n't think the eu side would be prepared to do it - why would they allow us to cherry- here is the agenda for the day .",
