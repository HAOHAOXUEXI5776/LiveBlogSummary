                "sometimes claims included inaccuracies an early message after the november 2015 attacks in paris included a bombing , which did n't happen , among the various attacks launched by its cell but this seems more due to operational issues than a desire to brag , deny , obfuscate or invent .",

                "it also claimed responsibility for the westminster attack in london in march , though again , there is nothing to indicate anyone from the organisation was in touch with khalid massood , the extremist who drove a car into pedestrians and stabbed a police officer outside parliament .",

                "the manchester claim has some inaccuracies and gaps : it appears to indicate that several explosive devices were left at the arena rather than a single one being set off by the bomber as a suicide attack ; and , unusually , the nom de guerre of the attacker is not given .", 
                "the former confusion may indicate that a planned operation went awry , with perhaps the bomber setting off the explosives early by accident .", 
                "the latter omission is harder to explain if isis was deeply involved in the attack .", 
                "in recent years , analysts have looked at the timing of claims .", 
                "if they were issued quickly and included some telling operational detail that would only be known to conspirators then that indicated isis had prior knowledge of the attack .",

                "in several cases , isis provided proof of its deep involvement by publishing pre-recorded videos of attackers , though some of these appear to have reached the group only as the attack was under way .",

                "what we have n't had yet is isis claiming an attack that has absolutely nothing to do with their agenda and ideology , which is important in working out who was responsible for this tragedy .",
