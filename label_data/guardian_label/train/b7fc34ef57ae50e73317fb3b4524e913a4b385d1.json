                "hungarian riot police fired teargas and water cannon over the border with serbia , after frustrated crowds , who had gathered there in their thousands when hungary closed its border on tuesday , tried to burst through a gate that connects the two countries .", 
                "hungary 's actions were met with fury by the serbian government , which said its northern neighbours had no right to fire into serbian territory .", 
                "tensions boiled over after thousands of refugees fleeing wars in syria , iraq and afghanistan began arriving at the horgo\u00e5\u00a1 border crossing between serbia and hungary , in the hours after budapest finally sealed it following months of threats to do so .", 
                "but to many refugees , whose understanding of how to navigate europe is largely gleaned from the more than 170,000 people who had successfully transited through hungary since the start of the year , the move came as a shock .", 
                "frustrations were then amplified further when a handful of syrians who were subsequently allowed into hungary to claim asylum had their applications rejected within minutes , seemingly without a proper assessment of their individual cases and backgrounds .", 
                "the tipping point came after an iraqi refugee , one of 60 who was caught trying to breach the new border fence in separate incidents on tuesday , was convicted in a specially convened hungarian court .", 
                "he was the first to be prosecuted under controversial new hungarian laws enacted this week that criminalise the act of crossing the fence ."
