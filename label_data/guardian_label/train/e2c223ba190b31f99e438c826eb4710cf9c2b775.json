                "but according to fairfax , political strategists for both major parties believe the coalition is on track to lose about 12 seats at the july 2 poll , which would return the turnbull government , albeit with a reduced second-term majority .", 
                "the prime minister 's home state of nsw has emerged as the weakest link for the coalition and the state where the most seats could change hands , but the alp 's push to claim as many as 11 queensland seats of the 21 required for labor to form government is flagging .",

                "in a similar vein , the australian reports that shorten 's unrelenting attack on the coalition 's proposed business tax cuts is driving a deep wedge between the opposition and corporate australia .", 
                "as the opposition leader yesterday declared he would not be dictated to by business , four of the nation 's most respected business leaders called for a higher standard of political debate , questioning labor 's divisive election tactics .", 
                "former business council of australia president graham bradley warned that labor 's recent policies gave few in business confidence the party had learned its lesson from the mining and carbon tax debacles .", 
                "wesfarmers and woodside chairman michael chaney lamented the scaremongering and divisive approach that 's taken in modern political campaigns that was pitting battlers versus well-off , rich versus poor , haves versus have-nots , rather than working to achieve a greater pie for all .", 
                "on the campaign trail bill shorten will campaign in queensland for a second day in a row .", 
                "guardian australia 's political editor , lenore taylor , writes that he will announce that $ 1bn from the turnbull government 's $ 5bn northern australia infrastructure facility will be repurpose for tourism projects in the north under labor .",

                "the campaign you should be watching with shorten again in queensland lets take a look at the seat of petrie north of brisbane , a bellwether seat currently held by the lnp 's luke howarth by a margin of 0.5 % .", 
                "according to fairfax : luke howarth defeated now-queensland attorney-general yvette d'ath to claim the seat in 2013 .", 
                "it 's the coalition 's second-most marginal seat in australia and will be one of the first to fall should there be a swing to labor .", 
                "the electorate stretches north to burpengary , east to redcliffe , south to aspley and west to north lakes .", 
                "howarth has performed well locally , but it 's hard to see petrie 's dissatisfaction with the rudd-gillard-rudd era flowing through another electoral cycle .",
