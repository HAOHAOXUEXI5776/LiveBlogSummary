                "here is a full summary of the key points from damian green 's interviews this morning .", 
                "green , the first secretary of state , said britain could remain subject to european court of justice rulings during a transitional period after brexit .", 
                "( see 9.01am . )", 
                "he said appealing to other parties to work with the government on policy was just a grown-up way of doing politics '' .", 
                "we 're saying that politicians of all parties , it 's not just addressed to jeremy corbyn , but that there are big issues facing this country , obviously brexit is the overwhelming one , but there 's counter-terrorism , there 's workers ' rights - the thing that 's very much in the news today with the matthew taylor report - issues like the industrial strategy .", 
                "and politicians of all parties are invited to contribute their ideas and that 's a grown-up way of doing politics .", 
                "i think a lot of your listeners would think actually if politicians just said why do n't we do this about a particular national issue rather than just sit in the trenches and shell each other , then we might actually have better government and that 's what the prime minister is talking about tomorrow .", 
                "but in his today interview green said little to suggest that that theresa may 's appeal for cross-party cooperation ( see 9.21am ) will make much difference .", 
                "it was put to him that there was a majority in the commons for increasing public sector pay , or reducing tuition fees , or adopting a more jobs-first approach to brexit , but on all three issues he played down the prospect of working with the opposition to develop new policy .", 
                "green said the government would not reintroduce plans to increase national insurance contributions for the self-employed .", 
                "philip hammond , the chancellor , proposed this in his spring budget .", 
                "the plan would have raised \u00a3 2bn over four years , but he dropped it after complaints that it broke the tory 2015 manifesto promise not to increase nics .", 
                "asked if the government would try to introduce the nics increase again , he said : we wo n't be revisiting that the house of commons has already spoken on that so we wo n't be revisiting that .", 
                "he said there was no credible plot '' against theresa may in existence .", 
                "asked about stories in the sunday papers about tory mps plotting to oust her , he replied : i 'm saying that there is no credible plot going on .", 
                "there is nothing like that going on .", 
                "the prime minister is determined to carry on to lead the party and the country for many years to come and the overwhelming majority of conservative mps are behind her in that .", 
                "he dismissed complaints from meps that eu nationals living in the uk would have their rights reduced under the government 's plans for them post brexit .", 
                "in a joint article , the leaders of groups representing three quarters of meps have strongly criticised the government 's post-brexit offer to eu nationals living in the uk .", 
                "asked what he would say to them , green replied : i would say 'read our proposal ' .", 
                "our proposal is precisely that - that somebody who is here now will keep the rights that they already have and we hope and expect that british citizens living in other eu countries will keep the rights that they already have now .", 
                "he dismissed the prospect of may deciding to quit of her own accord over the summer .", 
                "she would carry on , he insisted .", 
                "she thinks not just that it 's her duty but that she has a programme for britain that encompasses not just a good brexit deal but also a domestic agenda that will spread prosperity around this country , make this a fairer society , tackle some of the injustices that we still have in our society , and that fire burns within her as strongly as ever .",
