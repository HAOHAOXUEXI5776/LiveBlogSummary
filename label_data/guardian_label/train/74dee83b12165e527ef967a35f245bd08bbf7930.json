                "the speech everyone remembers is the outstanding one he gave the day before the referendum vote .", 
                "it is probably a myth to think that that speech alone swayed a lot of votes , but it was a refined version of a stump speech he had been giving for several weeks , which probably did influence many voters , and what is certainly true is that brown played a vital role articulating a vision of a future for scotland in the uk , culminating in the vow '' .", 
                "for a few weeks in the autumn of 2014 he was back shaping events , acting like a shadow prime minister .", 
                "and now he is at it again .", 
                "in scotland brown 's argument was that the uk government could not just say no to independence ; it had to offer alternative , positive vision for the future .", 
                "with the eu referendum he 's adopting exactly the same approach , arguing for a remain vote not on the basis of the status quo , but on the basis of what the eu could be like in the future .", 
                "he set this out in a major speech this morning in the european parliament .", 
                "he said : in a few days ' time the focus of the referendum will shift from the current battle for the hearts and minds of britain 's 11m conservatives to an even larger group - britain 's 14m voters , 9m of them labour , who are not right-of centre - and to the danger that many of them will not vote remain but simply remain at home .", 
                "while more instinctively pro-european , this group 's concerns are not the same as the conservatives .", 
                "they do not think the status quo is to their benefit , they want to know how their lives can improve and they need to hear a positive message of how europe can deliver for them in the future .", 
                "to win in the scottish referendum we had to do much more than elaborate the negative consequences from the breakup of britain .", 
                "we had to set out a positive reform agenda , which eventually led to a new constitutional settlement .", 
                "fortunately there is an evolving agenda for the 2017 uk presidency of the european union which can make a reformed europe work better for britain and show how britain can lead in europe .", 
                "brown then set out a six-point agenda for reform of the eu .", 
                "1 - 500,000 new jobs for britain brown said these could be created by extending the single market .", 
                "economies of scale , lower production , transaction and distribution costs and easier access to finance could deliver - according to one estimate - 500,000 new jobs in the next decade and will also create the wealth that allows us to invest in our public services , especially the nhs .", 
                "2 - lower energy bills and more energy security brown said energy bills could be cut by creating a european energy and environmental union .", 
                "britain benefits from greater competition in energy markets , enhanced interconnections between states and , most of all , as the evolving north sea offshore grid shows , from new ways of using - and not wasting - our massive but intermittent wind and wave power .", 
                "the bigger the cross-european pooling of energy , the greater efficiency we achieve in the use of wind and wave .", 
                "3 - action against tax havens brown said europe needed to take action together to recover some of the revenue lost from having an estimated \u20ac1 trillion in european wealth in offshore tax havens .", 
                "4 - action against terrorism brown said europe needed to work together on ambitious strategy to tackle the causes of terrorism '' .", 
                "5 - help for communities affected by immigration brown said there should be a dedicated eu fund to help communities affected by immigration .", 
                "we should also champion the creation of a migration challenges and support fund - a european solidarity fund - that helps communities in which health care , schools and public services are under pressure because of sharp population changes .", 
                "we know that one of the greatest grievances of the public is that inadequate provision is being made where the nhs is under severe strain and where school enrolments are not met by enhanced teacher provision .", 
                "a dedicated eu fund would help address this issue .", 
                "6 - stronger protection for workers brown called for more eu regulations to protect workers .", 
                "finally , britain should propose stronger measures at the european level to protect workers hit by zero hours and casual contracts and in particular british workers undercut by exploitative employers in other european countries or operating underground in the uk .", 
                "action by the european union can prevent countries from engaging in a dog-eat-dog race to the bottom , under which the good employer is undercut by the bad and the bad by the worst .", 
                "it remains to be seen how much impact brown 's intervention will have in the campaign .", 
                "he was very influential in scotland , but in scotland he remains a highly respected figure .", 
                "in the uk as a whole , as he discovered in 2010 , his standing is rather lower .", 
                "and in 2014 there was a limit to the extent to which the real prime minister could get involved , because cameron recognised his appeal to scottish voters was minimal .", 
                "in the eu referendum cameron is front and centre , and less likely to cede space to his predecessor .", 
                "but for anyone unhappy about the relentless pessimism of the remain campaign , brown has provided an antidote .",

            "text": [
                "paul johnson , director of the ifs , was on the today programme this morning talking about its brexit report .", 
                "here are the main points from the interview .", 
                "johnson rejected vote leave 's claims that the ifs is biased because it receives funding from the eu .", 
                "he said : it 's true we get about 10 % of our income from something called the european research council , which is an independent , arms-length body which funds world class academic research in countries as diverse as norway and israel which are well outside of the european union .", 
                "that funds some of the more academic end of the research that we do , and certainly does n't impact on this kind of work .", 
                "but more importantly , for the last 30 years the ifs has really built its reputation on the independence and integrity of our work .", 
                "actually there is no sum of money from anywhere in the world which would influence what we said , because if it did then the point of the ifs and the reasons that you are referring to earlier , that we are listened to after budgets and so on , would simply be lost .", 
                "he dismissed vote leave 's claim that eu membership is costing the uk \u00a3 350m a week .", 
                "the \u00a3 350m a week is our full gross contribution to the eu before we get our rebate back , the rebate that mrs thatcher famously negotiated back in the 1980s , and before we take account of the money that we get back to pay to our farmers and so on .", 
                "to have that \u00a3 350m after we left the eu you would have to assume something rather bizarre , which is that we 'd left , we stopped paying contributions and our current partners nevertheless continued to pay us a rebate on contributions that we were n't making .", 
                "that 's where you get \u00a3 350m from .", 
                "and then in addition , there 's another \u00a3 100m or so , a bit less than that , which we get back to pay to farmers and so on which we could decide to spend on something entirely different but probably most of that , or certainly some of it , would continue to go in the same direction .", 
                "he said the gain to be had from not having to contribute to the eu would be cancelled out by the amount the government would lose from lower growth and lower tax revenues .", 
                "you 're absolutely right - \u00a3 8bn [ the net uk contribution to the eu ] is more than worth having , it 's about 1 % of everything that we spend at the moment .", 
                "the problem is that what really matters for the public finances going forward is the size of the economy .", 
                "now if the economy were to be about half a percent smaller than it otherwise would have been going forward then you lose that \u00a3 8bn , because you get less in the way of tax revenues in .", 
                "he said it was impossible to have a better trading relationship with the eu than the one already in place .", 
                "i 've taken the quotes from politicshome .",

                "in the long run , lower gdp would likely mean lower cash levels of public spending .", 
                "to put this in context , dealing with the public finance effect would require at least an additional one or two years of 'austerity ' - spending cuts or tax rises - at the same rate as we have experienced recently to get the public finances back to balance ( should that remain the government 's priority ) .",
