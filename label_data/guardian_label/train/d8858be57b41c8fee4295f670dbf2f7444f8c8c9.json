                "pressed whether the measures did n't send out a message of panic , he rejected that suggestion , and said there was no evidence to suggest that easing monetary policy made things worse .", 
                "i ca n't think of one instance where monetary easing was bad for confidence .", 
                "the surprise package sent the pound down yesterday ( it slumped 2 cents against the dollar ) and shares soaring .", 
                "most asian stock markets rose , with the hang seng in hong kong up 1.3 % .", 
                "european stock markets have opened higher today , with london 's ftse 100 index up 0.6 % , to 6782.10 in early trading .",

                "on \u0080\u0098super thursday , ' the bank cut interest rates to a new record low of 0.25 % from 0.5 % and hinted they could fall further although governor mark carney insisted that rates would not go negative .", 
                "he also unveiled additional funds for banks to help them pass on the base rate cut to households and businesses , along with more government and corporate bond purchases by the bank for cash , again to stimulate lending and drive borrowing costs lower .", 
                "the bank slashed its growth forecast for the uk for next year by an unprecedented amount .",

                "read our full story here .", 
                "business organisations and many city economists applauded the surprise package but some people were critical .", 
                "kate barker , a former bank of england rate-setter , warned ahead of yesterday 's meeting , writing in the times ( \u00e2\u00a3 ) , that cutting interest rates would do more harm than good , and would fail to boost household or business spending .",

                "the contrast between what the mpc did yesterday and what they did in july was quite stark and the fact that the additional qe measures found dissent from three policymakers does appear to suggest some division on the mpc .", 
                "if a company does n't feel compelled to borrow money to invest when base rates are at 0.5 % , why would it feel compelled to do so when base rates are at 0.25 % ?", 
                "the problem in the uk is n't availability or cheapness of credit but demand for it , and that demand is only likely to come when the uk government reacts to the slowdown in the economy when it delivers its autumn statement later this year .",
