                "although he stressed that he was not pre-judging what the inquiry would say , and that he was just setting out what is currently known , he went through eight possible explanations and explained which were credible , and which were much less helpful .", 
                "the best explanation seems to be lazy labour '' - or differential turnout , which meant that labour supporters were disproportionately less likely to vote .",

                "this idea of lazy labour '' - we have to have something to appeal to the media narrative - has been put forward to suggest that labour supporters were less likely to turn out to vote .", 
                "it speaks to what we know about the demographic profile of labour supporters : young , low-income , working class demographics , who are less likely to turn out to on voting day .", 
                "and there is some initial support for this from jon mellon and chris prosser of the british election study team who showed [ labour supporters were considerably less likely to turn out ] .",

                "the labour pollster james morris suggested that his internal polls produced more accurate results because they put questions about voting intention at the end , after questions about issues , forcing respondents to think about what was at stake before choosing a party .",
