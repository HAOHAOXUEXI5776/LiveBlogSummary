                "ministers have suffered a big defeat in the house of lords as peers have voted in favour of an amendment forcing the government to publish income-related figures for child poverty .", 
                "the amendment was tabled by the bishop of duham and backed strongly by labour peers and others .", 
                "it undermines a key part of the welfare bill , which is intended to abolish income-related child poverty targets and replace them with ones measuring life chances '' instead .", 
                "david gauke , the treasury minister , has told mps that he could not say what effective rate of tax google were paying .", 
                "replying to an urgent commons question about google 's deal to pay \u00a3 130m owed in taxes to hmrc , gauke said it was wrong to assume this was equivalent to a 3 % tax rage .", 
                "that figure was misleading , he told mps .", 
                "in terms of the 3 % figure which you mentioned , that is the very reason why i drew attention to the way that corporation tax is worked out .", 
                "[ tax is paid ] not on the basis of the profits relating to sales in a particular country , it is on the basis of the economic activity and assets held in a country and there are severe dangers were we to move in the direction of it being based on profits relating to sales there is no lower special rate for google or any other taxpayer in this country .", 
                "but when challenged by labour 's diana johnson if he would say what effective rate google was paying , he replied : no .", 
                "the position is because of taxpayer confidentiality .", 
                "the point i was making in the course of my remarks was that to look at profits from sales in the united kingdom is not a way in which one can calculate it .", 
                "the tax rate is currently 20 % .", 
                "that applies to everybody , but in terms of the effective tax rate that depends on the particular circumstances of any business .", 
                "the commons treasury committee has launched an inquiry into tax policy and the tax base .", 
                "in the commons andrew tyrie , the committee chair , said he thought fundamental reform of the corporate tax base probably now needs to be considered '' .", 
                "in a statement later he said : the complexity of tax law is turning what should be a straightforward principle - that everybody should pay the correct amount of tax - in to a piece of elastic .", 
                "for corporation tax , for instance , the problem is exacerbated by the globalisation of economic activity and any liability to tax that accompanies it .", 
                "a corporation 's duty to shareholders will be to minimise its tax liability .", 
                "it should be the duty of those making tax policy to find better ways to limit the elasticity .",

                "there is a lot the government could be doing .",

                "telling mps there were parallels with the kindertransport , he told mps : there are children out there who are at risk and i would urge the government to look carefully about this .", 
                "after all this is the 25th of january - a month ago we were celebrating that great christian festival of children and i hope that that spirit lingers beyond boxing day .",

                "lord parkinson obituary read more in a tribute to him david cameron said : [ parkinson ] was the first big political figure that i ever worked for and got to know .", 
                "he was a man of huge ability .", 
                "he was passionate that what he was doing and the team of ministers that he worked with was about transforming britain in the 1980s by improving industrial relations , by reforming the trade unions , by making sure that business was in the private sector , by encouraging entrepreneurship .", 
                "he was someone i really enjoyed working with a great deal .", 
                "he was part of a great political generation that did really extraordinary things for our country .",

                "the british government is lobbying to change the definition of overseas development aid ( oda ) to include more forms of defence and security spending , prompting concerns that the uk aid programme could be used to plug holes in the budgets of other government departments ."
