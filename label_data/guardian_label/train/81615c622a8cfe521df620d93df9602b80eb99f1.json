                "this is significant because this is the one demand where getting what he wants will prove most difficult , and the text of the letter suggests he is minded to be flexible .", 
                "number 10 are briefing this too .", 
                "see 11.11am .", 
                "this is what the letter says : as i have said previously , we can reduce the flow of people coming from within the eu by reducing the draw that our welfare system can exert across europe .", 
                "so we have proposed that people coming to britain from the eu must live here and contribute for four years before they qualify for inwork benefits or social housing .", 
                "and that we should end the practice of sending child benefit overseas .", 
                "i understand how difficult some of these issues are for other member states and i look forward to dicussing these proposals further so we can find a solution that deals with this issue .", 
                "cameron says that he wants legally binding principles that safeguard the operation of the union .", 
                "he spelt them out in his letter , as the first of his four principles for reform , under the heading economic governance .", 
                "he has called for measures to boost competitiveness and cut the regulatory buden on business .", 
                "in his letter cameron sums up these , his second set of aims , under the heading competitiveness .", 
                "he has called for measures to preserve national sovereignty .", 
                "these are summed up as his third demand under the heading sovereignty in the letter .", 
                "here 's an extract .", 
                "first , i want to end britain 's obligation to work towards an ever closer union as set out in the treaty .", 
                "it is very important to make clear that this commitment will no longer apply to the united kingdom .", 
                "i want to do this in a formal , legally-binding and irreversible way .", 
                "second , while the european parliament plays an important role , i want to enhance the role of national parliaments , by proposing a new arrangement where groups of national parliaments , acting together , can stop unwanted legislative proposals .", 
                "the precise threshold of national parliaments required will be a matter for the negotiation .", 
                "third , i want to see the eu 's commitments to subsidiarity fully implemented , with clear proposals to achieve that .", 
                "as the dutch have said , the ambition should be europe where necessary , national where possible .", 
                "on ever closer union , it is worth pointing out that the european union has effectively already conceded that it is willing to give way on this .", 
                "it did so last year , in the little-noticed paragraph 27 of the communique issued after the summit in june .", 
                "he has said that net eu migration to the uk is unsustainable .", 
                "in his speech , and in his letter , he said immigration - his fourth area of concern - was a particular problem for britain .", 
                "and he said other eu countries had an interest in cutting the level of migration from poor countries to rich countries because the poor countries were losing skilled workers .", 
                "in his letter he said : the uk believes in an open economy .", 
                "but we have got to be able to cope with all the pressures that free movement can bring - on our schools , our hospitals and our public services .", 
                "right now , the pressures are too great .", 
                "the issue is one of scale and speed .", 
                "unlike some other member states , britain 's population is already expanding .", 
                "our population is set to reach over 70 million in the next decades and we are forecast to become the most populous country in the eu by 2050 .", 
                "at the same time , our net migration is running at over 300,000 a year .", 
                "that is not sustainable .", 
                "we have taken lots of steps to control immigration from outside the eu .", 
                "but we need to be able to exert greater control on arrivals from inside the eu too .", 
                "britain has always been an open , trading nation , and we do not want to change that .", 
                "but we do want to find arrangements to allow a member state like the uk to restore a sense of fairness to our immigration system and to reduce the current very high level of population flows from within the eu into the uk .", 
                "these have been unplanned and are much higher than forecast - far higher than anything the eu 's founding fathers ever envisaged .", 
                "these very substantial flows of population have , of course , also had a significant impact on a number of member states , many of whose most highly qualified citizens have departed en masse .", 
                "so this is a shared challenge .", 
                "he has said he is not proposing precise means , or detailed legal proposals , for bringing the reforms we seek into effect .", 
                "that is a matter for the negotiation , not least as there may , in each case , be different ways of achieving the same result .", 
                "he has said that he wants to reform our relationship with the european court of human rights by scrapping labour 's human rights act and introducing a new british bill of rights .", 
                "this was in the speech , not the letter , because the echr is not an eu body .", 
                "he has said he wants to use uk law to limit the impact of the eu charter of fundamental rights .", 
                "again , this was in the speech but not the letter .", 
                "here is an extract from the speech .", 
                "we will enshrine in our domestic law that the eu charter of fundamental rights does not create any new rights .", 
                "we will make it explicit to our courts that they can not use the eu charter as the basis for any new legal challenge citing spurious new human rights grounds .", 
                "we will also examine whether we can go one step further.we need to examine the way that germany and other eu nations uphold their constitution and sovereignty .", 
                "for example , the constitutional court in germany retains the right to review whether essential constitutional freedoms are respected when powers are transferred to europe .", 
                "and it also reserves the right to review legal acts by european institutions and courts to check that they remain within the scope of the eu 's powers or whether they have overstepped the mark .",
