                "us 'pushed uk into war too early ' , says ambassador sir jeremy greenstock , the uk 's ambassador to the un in 2003 , has told the bbc that pressure from the us propelled britain into military action before tony blair had wanted to : i felt that at the time , the british felt it at the time , i think the prime minister felt it at the time , that the americans pushed us into going into military action too early .", 
                "greenstock said senior figures in the us thought a further un resolution was a waste of time '' : the americans were n't genuine about it - but the prime minister was genuine about it because he thought there was a chance that saddam could be made to back down before we had to use military force .", 
                "and george bush for a while agreed with him .", 
                "but other people behind george bush did n't agree with him and thought it was a waste of time .", 
                "chilcot : the front pages nick sutton ( @ suttonnick ) a flavour of the # chilcot # tomorrowspaperstoday # bbcpapers no doubt at all about the key conclusions from yesterday : chilcot 's damning assertion that the uk chose to join the invasion of iraq before the peaceful options for disarmament had been exhausted '' and blair 's response : i express more sorrow , regret and apology than you can ever know or believe i believe we made the right decision and the world is better and safer .", 
                "what to read : the report with a report so vast , conclusions so wide-ranging , and reaction so expansive , i wo n't try to recap it all here , but will instead point you in the direction of the key distillations of what we learned from chilcot on wednesday .", 
                "the key points of the report : the failures of intelligence and of the people involved in making the decision to go to war .", 
                "the letters written by blair to then us president george bush , including the now instantly infamous memo : i will be with you , whatever . ''",

                "what to read : comment the guardian view : a country ruined , trust shattered , a reputation trashed '' : the defining sting was conveyed in just six words penned by tony blair himself , in a letter to mr bush in july 2002 - 'i will be with you , whatever ' .", 
                "here , in essence , we have the private promise from which every abuse of public process would flow , as well as that pervasive , poisonous sense that the government was not playing it straight .", 
                "the prime minister was not bone-headed , his letters to the president warned of deep doubts on the part of both mps and the public , and shrewdly anticipated great difficulty in whipping europe into line .", 
                "but he negated the value of all this insight , and fatally compromised his own preference for constructing a un-blessed route to war , by preceding it all with the bald vow that washington could count on him .", 
                "'it is n't about a lie ' : tony blair on iraq from 2001 to 2016 jonathan freedland : blair 's iraq war legacy leaves him damned for all time '' : some will say that none of this is really new , that chilcot simply repeated everything the critics had said about this war from the beginning .", 
                "but that means a lot .", 
                "this was the voice of the establishment , not a placard at a demo or a trenchant guardian column .",

                "for those who stood against the war , including the families of those who lost their lives , that represents belated vindication .", 
                "for blair it means a verdict that damns him for the ages .", 
                "former un weapons inspector hans blix : blair told me the intelligence was clear '' : blair and other leaders misrepresented reality , urging a war over the faulty they had created .", 
                "i do not see evidence of bad faith , but i do see a disastrous failure of judgment .", 
                "reg keys , whose soldier son tom died in iraq , says the report is proof he died in vain : chilcot was not a court of law and it was not in his remit to look at the legality of the iraq war .", 
                "but as far as i am concerned this inquiry was judge and jury .", 
                "tony blair , the man who misled parliament and manufactured and massaged the intelligence underpinning the decision to send our troops to war , stands morally convicted .", 
                "he is guilty as charged .",

                "for the mix of mourners staring into the middle distance , desperate relatives wailing for help , forensic officers crouched near puddles and others who stood bewildered by the scale of destruction , it would merely tell them what they already knew : that the war and its aftermath were both grave mistakes .", 
                "the few who had seen brief reports from london on iraqi television shrugged and pointed at the damage , when asked what they made of what was effectively britain 's mea culpa .", 
                "'this is the reason for all this chaos , ' said bassam jaber abayati , a karrada local .", 
                "'they should have known better .",
