                "good evening !", 
                "if you 're joining us tonight , that only means one thing : you 're as excited as we are about the first democratic presidential debate since the new hampshire primary highlighted major fault lines within the party !", 
                "( well , that , or you 've already caught up on both american crime and american crime story , the ostensible similarities and crucial differences between which are actually a pretty good metaphor for this democratic campaign cycle , if you squint at them . )", 
                "we were going to do some boring diptych of hillary clinton and bernie sanders , but look at these cookies they 're serving at the debate !", 
                "they 're darling !", 
                "young/reuters this debate was originally intended to be the first face-to-face meeting between former secretary of state hillary clinton and vermont senator bernie sanders since the iowa caucus ( victor : clinton ) and the new hampshire primary ( victory : sanders ) , until pressure from grassroots liberals upset with the democratic national committee pushed for more debates - and for debates that were n't scheduled on holiday weekends .", 
                "( speaking as one of the ink-stained scribes who documents these debates for posterity and who would occasionally like to go home and feed his goldfish , we curse those squeaky wheels for their gumption but applaud them for their fervor . )", 
                "before we get into the he-said , she-said , let 's establish the whos , the whats , the wheres , the whens and , if at all possible , the hows of tonight 's debate .", 
                "who 's debating/moderating/hosting ?", 
                "it 's not a crowded field tonight : just clinton and sanders , whose two hours ' traffic on our stage will be moderated by gwen ifill and judy woodruff , co-anchors and co-managing editors of pbs newshour .", 
                "pbs will host the debate , which will be simulcast by cnn and promoted with a partnership with facebook .", 
                "yes , that means that facebook-submitted questions will be asked of the candidates , and that the more thirsty debatewatchers amongst you ( and us ) will argue over which questioner is the cutest .", 
                "what number debate is this ?", 
                "this is the sixth .", 
                "( sigh . )", 
                "where is the debate being held ?", 
                "why , in the beautiful helen bader concert hall on the main campus of the university of wisconsin-milwaukee in milwaukee , wisconsin !", 
                "the concert hall contains 760 seats , an orchestra pit and was originally a synagogue .", 
                "when is the debate ?", 
                "the debate will begin at nine p.m. eastern standard time , and is expected to last two hours , although if ifill and woodruff take a cue from msnbc 's brian williams , they 'll just tell the audience that it 's a 90-minute debate and cackle malevolently as those at home slowly realize that they 're going to have to pay their babysitter time and a half .", 
                "how 's this gon na go ?", 
                "aggressively , we think !", 
                "the last democratic debate was arguably the most intense and policy-focused of the 2016 election cycle , with high-minded arguments about the nature of progressivism punctuated by accusations of smearing from both sides .", 
                "clinton maintains a much easier path to the nomination , particularly ahead of a slew of southern states that might not take so kindly to sanders ' yankee socialism , but the vermont senator 's success in new hampshire laid bare some serious demographic challenges facing the clinton campaign , particularly with young people , liberals and women .", 
                "we 'll be liveblogging the whole thing , so sit back , relax , pop some corn , read our non-debate campaign liveblog from earlier today for context , and get ready for a democratic g\u00e3\u00b6tterd\u00e3\u00a4mmerung of epic proportions ."
