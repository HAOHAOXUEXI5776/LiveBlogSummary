                "johnson said , if you consider tax and benefit changes introduced by the coalition , the poorest have seen the biggest proportionate losses '' .", 
                "but if you look at all the changes introduced since the financial crash ( ie , including the 50p top rate of tax and other labour measures ) , the richest have been hit hardest '' .", 
                "he said middle earners had been the most protected .", 
                "as far as tax and benefit changes are concerned , benefit cuts have hit low income working age people .", 
                "tax increases have hit those on the highest incomes much the hardest .", 
                "people on middle and upper middle incomes have been remarkably insulated on average from tax and benefit changes .", 
                "he said household incomes would probably be higher in 2015 than in 2010 .", 
                "average household incomes have just about regained their pre-recession levels .", 
                "they are finally rising and probably will be higher in 2015 than they were in 2010 , and possibly higher than their 2009 peak .", 
                "but that still represents by far the slowest recovery in incomes in modern history .", 
                "ed miliband claimed people were \u00a3 1,600 worse off and osborne claimed people were \u00a3 900 better off because miliband was talking about gross earnings , while osborne was talking about net incomes , he said .", 
                "he said incomes were a better measures , and miliband 's figures only went up to april 2014 .", 
                "but he also said osborne 's claims involved an element of forecasting .", 
                "mr osborne is relying on forecasts of income through to the end of 2015 .", 
                "all of the real increase since 2010 is in the forecast .", 
                "it occurs in the last year , in 2015 .", 
                "there is no actual increase in the data we have so far .", 
                "johnson said inequality had fallen a little '' over this parliament if you assume everyone faces the same rate of inflation .", 
                "but if you adjust for differential inflation ( ie , the way inflation affects some groups more than others ) , inequality in 2014-15 is very similar '' to its level in 2007-08 , he said .", 
                "he said osborne ought to tell the voters how he was planning to achieve his \u00a3 12bn welfare cuts .", 
                "it is now almost two years since he announced his intention of cutting welfare spending by \u00a3 12bn .", 
                "since then the main announcement has been the plan not to cut anything from the main pensioner benefits .", 
                "we have been told about no more than \u00a3 2bn of the planned cuts to working age benefits .", 
                "and remember apparently the plan '' is to have those \u00a3 12bn of cuts in place by 2017-18 .", 
                "it is time we knew more about what they might actually involve the chancellor argues that because he is committed to \u00a3 12bn of welfare cuts and \u00a3 5bn of anti tax avoidance measures the required cuts to public service spending are much more modest .", 
                "but if he really wants us to believe that then he needs to be more explicit about how he actually thinks he can cut welfare spending and raise substantial additional sums from clamping down on tax avoidance .", 
                "johnson said the plans for help to buy isas and the extra money for mental health services in the budget were unfunded .", 
                "he said whitehall departments would have to plan for dramatically differing '' spending scenarios after the election .", 
                "he said , as a reformer , osborne would be remembered most for his changes to pensions .", 
                "with further changes to the taxation of annuities it is in changing the structure of the taxation of savings and pensions that he has been most radical over the past five years .", 
                "this is possibly the one area of lasting structural change in the tax system for which he will be remembered .",

                "our latest estimates suggest that labour would be able to meet its fiscal targets with no cuts at all after 2015-16 .",

                "here are the key points from nick clegg 's call clegg phone-in .", 
                "clegg said that britain and the rest of the world should recognise the palestinian state if binyamin netanyahu , the israeli prime minister , continued to rule out the two-state solution .", 
                "he said that netanyahu 's new stance , which he unveiled at the end of his election campaign , was extremely worrying '' .", 
                "clegg also said that he disagreed on this with david cameron , who has congratulated netanyahu on his re-election and who used a speech last night to say he was looking forward to working with him .", 
                "the house of commons did vote to recognise palestine last year , after labour mps pushed for a vote , but ministers abstained and the government chose to ignore the vote .", 
                "but now the situation has changed , clegg said .", 
                "i actually share president obama 's views much more than david cameron 's .", 
                "i think it is extremely worrying .", 
                "it can not be more alarming to have seen binyamin netanyahu , in the latter stages of the election campaign in israel , do something that no leading israeli politician has ever done , which is to rule out the prospect of a two-state solution .", 
                "the whole push for peace , for decades now , has been premised on the point that at some point the israeli nation and a palestinian state can be created to live in peaceful co-existence with each other .", 
                "it is an astonishing thing that he should have departed from that long , long tradition .", 
                "i think it is quite right that the white house has expressed serious misgivings about that .", 
                "and i have to say to you , if binyamin netanyahu now unilaterally has decided to rule out the prospect of a palestinian state , then i think it is inevitable that the british parliament , as it voted to a few months ago , should rule a palestinian state in .", 
                "in other words , that we should in response - and it would be in response to extreme provocation from netanyahu - act to recognise a palestinian state .", 
                "it can not be right , given that this is the crucible of so much violence and division across so many communities , that one man , in what i assume was a desperate attempt to curry some votes , should basically tear up the basic tramlines on which a peace deal is likely to occur i very much hope , fervently hope , that [ this turns out to ] be breathless rhetoric that he is now going to row back from .", 
                "if he carries out his threat to rule out a two-state solution , and expand illegal settlements , then i think the world , including the british parliament , would have no option , inevitably , but to recognise the palestinian state .", 
                "he said he welcomed the latest plans from broadcasters for one seven-party debate , a question time session involving cameron , clegg and ed miliband , a challenger '' parties debate and jeremy paxman interviews with cameron and miliband .", 
                "this was not ideal but better than nothing , he said .", 
                "i just want something to happen . ''", 
                "he said that conservative spending plans for the next parliament would nobble '' the working-age poor .", 
                "the conservatives are departing quite radically [ from the coalition 's approach to spending ] , lurching away from the approach which we 've taken over the last half a decade .", 
                "over the last five years , we have basically taken a mixture of tax increases and spending reductions , welfare reductions , action on tax avoidance , to start balancing the books .", 
                "that 's allowed us to halve the deficit as a proportion of our nation 's wealth .", 
                "the conservatives announced last autumn that they are going to lurch away from that and only nobble the working-age poor and only the working-age poor will make additional sacrifices to balance the books .", 
                "i do n't think that 's fair , i do n't think it 's right to ask for \u00a3 1,500 off the 8m poorest families in this country , which is what the conservatives want to do .", 
                "he said that he had given up smoking and was now vaping .",
