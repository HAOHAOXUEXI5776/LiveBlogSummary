                "the debate is expected within the next few weeks .", 
                "but thornberry said a main gate '' vote ( giving final approval to trident renewal ) was not necessary , and that they government would only be holding the vote to embarrass labour .", 
                "in those circumstances , and given that the commons voted on trident in 2007 , abstaining would be justified , she implied .", 
                "i think it is important to note that the tories are talking about this as being a main gate decision , a decision at which there is a no point of return in relation to trident .", 
                "and that is untrue .", 
                "their own review says that they will not be having a main gate vote .", 
                "so , if they do ask for a vote , it will be a vote on principle .", 
                "we had a vote on principle in 2007 .", 
                "there will be many people who are in favour of trident who will be asking the question , what on earth have the tories been doing since 2007 that we now need to have another vote in principle ? ''", 
                "if they are not playing games with us , why do n't they get on with that ?", 
                "she suggested that she would not be willing to authorise the use of nuclear weapons herself .", 
                "this is what she said when nick robinson asked if she would be willing to press the nuclear button .", 
                "if nuclear weapons need to be threatened , then they have failed .", 
                "everybody says that .", 
                "the whole point about nuclear weapons is that you do n't use them .", 
                "and in order for them to work at all , you have to be able to say with confidence , i have a big stick , my stick is larger than your stick '' , and both sides need to be confident that that threat is a real one .", 
                "she suggested that she thought it would be possible for labour 's defence review to produce a trident policy the party could get behind .", 
                "this is contrary to what andy burnham was saying on the programme earlier .",

                "in other words , it was not just a case of deciding whether to order new trident submarines with nuclear weapons , or to give up the nuclear deterrent , she said .", 
                "i had been challenged and told that it was either trident or nothing , that it was a binary option .", 
                "and our view is that it is not necessarily a binary option .", 
                "we do need to look at all the possibilities .",

                "this is what she said when robinson asked her to explain the comment she made to the plp last night about how trident could one day become as obsolete as the spitfire .", 
                "there are questions to be asked about trident .", 
                "there are forthcoming generations of drones that can work underseas .", 
                "at the moment they have two problems ; one is communications , and the other is battery life .", 
                "but i was explaining to the plp that i had actually met one of the young turks who at the moment is developing these drones , and they are very hopeful that in the next 10 years or so that actually the seas will no longer be opaque .", 
                "the idea of the trident replacement is that it can hide in the sea .", 
                "if technology is moving faster than that , then it may well be that trident will not be able to hide .", 
                "and if that 's right , then if we are to bet everything on mutually assured destruction , we have to be assured that it is going to work .", 
                "and if it ca n't hide any more , that is a problem .", 
                "and it is right for the opposition , before voting for a commitment which would cost , according to crispin blunt [ the tory chair of the commons foreign affairs committee ] \u00a3 168bn , we have to make sure that it works .", 
                "when robinson told her that lord west , the former head of the navy and former labour security minister , had rung the programme to say this argument was nonsense '' , thornberry replied : alan and i have had this discussion .", 
                "and he knows as well that the chinese and the russians and the americans are pouring billions into this technology in order to be able to find submarines .", 
                "they would not be pouring that money in if they did not think there was a realistic chance of being able to get somewhere .",
