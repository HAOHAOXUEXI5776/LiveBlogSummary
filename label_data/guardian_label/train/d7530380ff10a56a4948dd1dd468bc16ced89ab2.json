            "text": [
                "we got an interesting question this week from a reader , directed at frances ryan , who had most recently written about a potential paralympic star forced to pull out due to cuts in disability support .", 
                "they asked : what can be done to challenge and change the current culture of treating disabled people so poorly ?", 
                "here is ryan 's response : i think there 's two threads here .", 
                "firstly , challenging the government who are creating policy and in turn , exacerbating the culture .", 
                "secondly , challenging the culture itself .", 
                "that first one probably feels a particularly insurmountable challenge right now but focusing on tangible hope is key .", 
                "we can oppose the policy by writing to targeted mps and lords when this stuff comes up ( look at personal independence payments .", 
                "it can work . )", 
                "and crucially we can give practical help to people going through the assessments by organizing ( see groups like fight back and disabled people against cuts ) ; whether that 's sharing tips for assessments or advocacy to help win on appeal .", 
                "equally , changing the demonizing culture is a huge task but there are small things we can do : from challenging anti-disability and/or anti-benefit rhetoric when we hear it in the office or the pub , to telling our own disability stories through grassroots art .", 
                "the campaign stop funding hate offers a way to directly jolt right wing papers and their hateful rhetoric by lobbying their advertisers .",
