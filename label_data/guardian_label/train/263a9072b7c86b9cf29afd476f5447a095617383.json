                "he started by reminding the country of his record so far : i have always believed in governing with respect that 's why in the last parliament , we devolved power to scotland and wales and gave the people of scotland a referendum on whether to stay within the uk .", 
                "and then turned to what he will do next : in this parliament i will stay true to my word and implement as fast as i can the devolution that all parties agreed for wales , scotland and northern ireland .", 
                "he gave made a particularly inflated promise for scotland - not quite full fiscal autonomy but increased power over taxes was in there : in scotland , our plans are to create the strongest devolved government anywhere in the world with important powers over taxation .", 
                "but was clear not to forget england : and no constitutional settlement would be complete if it did not offer also fairness to england .", 
                "an in-out referendum on the eu is on cameron reeled off a list of pledges for the next five years and emphatically underlined the commitment that will likely dominate political debate for the next two years : and yes we will deliver that in-out referendum on our future in europe .",
