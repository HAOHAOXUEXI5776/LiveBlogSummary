                "first , the \u00a3 30bn cut the tories claim they are going to make after the election is not for the whole parliament , but for the first two full years - 2016/17 and 2017/18 - only .", 
                "if we look at their own spending forecasts over the full period - up to 2019-20 - the actual minimum planned reduction in public spending is \u00a3 37bn .", 
                "but that does not take into account other areas where spending is due to rise over the next parliament , or where commitments have been made to cut tax .", 
                "to achieve those planned spending increases and promised tax cuts , the scale of spending cuts in other areas must increase even beyond \u00a3 37bn to meet the treasury 's targets on the deficit .", 
                "so second , we look at planned increase in spending on pensions and social security which is forecast to rise from \u00a3 218bn in 2015-16 to \u00a3 241bn in 2019-20 .", 
                "that takes the scale of the cuts required in other areas to \u00a3 55bn .", 
                "third , capital spending is also forecast to rise .", 
                "that will require even bigger cuts to day-to-day spending to meet the chancellor 's deficit target , taking the total up to \u00a3 59bn .", 
                "a figure confirmed by the ifs in their 2015 green budget .", 
                "fourth , the commitment to maintain spending on overseas development assistance ( oda ) at 0.7 per cent of gross national income adds a further \u00a3 1bn to the cuts required elsewhere , because - to maintain that commitment - oda spending must rise slightly faster than inflation .", 
                "fifth and finally , the tories have also committed to make a number of tax cuts at some stage over the next parliament .", 
                "unlike labour 's plans , these tory tax promises are totally unfunded and they have not specified when these will come in .", 
                "the only stipulation the tories have made is that , in order not to disrupt the treasury 's stated plans on the deficit , they should be paid for from additional cuts in spending .", 
                "our calculations take the cautious assumption that they will be introduced in the final full year of the next parliament .", 
                "that would cost \u00a3 10bn a year according to the house of commons library .", 
                "putting these five hidden factors together , we can see that - in order to keep all their commitments on spending , tax and the deficit - the tories would in the next five years need to make spending cuts which add up to a staggering total of \u00a3 70bn .",
