                "by 2041 , scotland will have 1.32m pensioners , it said , but the number of working scots would rise by just 1 % .",

                "under that scenario , scotland 's wage-earning population would fall by 3 % .", 
                "the nrs made clear these figures were illustrative and not official data ( a distinction the scottish government 's press release did not highlight ) but fiona hyslop , the scottish culture and external affairs secretary , said they underlined the critical importance of maintaining inward migration to scotland .
