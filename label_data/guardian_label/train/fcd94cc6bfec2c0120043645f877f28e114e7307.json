                "but , even though rudd did not really go any further in criticising trump than number 10 yesterday , she expressed her disapproval with conviction .", 
                "theresa may always sounds nervous saying anything remotely disobliging about trump , but rudd sounded as though she meant it .", 
                "she also dropped hints to mps that she , personally , would like to go further .", 
                "here are the main points .", 
                "rudd seemed to confirm that trump 's state visit has effectively been postponed until further notice .", 
                "this is not especially surprising , because it has already been revealed that trump does not want to visit the uk until he can be sure of a warm welcome .", 
                "many mps said the visit should be cancelled altogether .", 
                "in response , rudd repeatedly used the same formula .", 
                "she said : an invitation for the visit has been extended and accepted , but the dates and the precise arrangements have yet to be agreed .", 
                "but she made a point of thanking the mps who asked these questions , implying that she was at least sympathetic .", 
                "and she adopted the same response to the labour mp kevin brennan who suggested that , given the queen 's age , the royal wedding next year and the birth of another great-grandchild on the way , the government should use these as reasons for announcing the postponement of the visit , for three years .", 
                "some mps called for trump to be banned from the uk in the light of his decision to retweet far-right , islamophobic propaganda .", 
                "chris bryant , a former labour foreign office minister , even suggested trump should be arrested if he came to the uk .", 
                "bryant said : i say to the home secretary , it is no good saying \u0080\u0098we 've been robust ' .",

                "you can not stand up to this kind of action , you can not stand up to horrible racism , or pretend to do so , and invite the man in through the front door .", 
                "in the past , and quite rightly , the prime minister when she was home secretary said homophobes and racists who will stir up hatred in this country will not be allowed in this country and if they come to this country , they will be arrested .", 
                "that is what should happen in this case and the home secretary knows it .", 
                "just say it .",

                "not only has the commander-in-tweet done this , he has defended it , publicly chastising the british prime minister for her comments .", 
                "putting aside the question of a state visit , should he even be allowed to enter our country , because unprecedented actions require unprecedented responses .", 
                "khalid mahmood , a labour foreign affairs spokesman , also suggested that , if a muslim leader was promoting hatred in the way trump was , he would be banned from the uk .", 
                "rudd brushed aside calls for trump to be excluded from the country , but she said the government had expressed absolute clarity in terms of its criticisms of trump .", 
                "rudd suggested that trump should give up twitter .", 
                "in response to a question from the tory mp peter bone , who suggested the world would be a better place if trump deleted his twitter account , rudd replied : it 's interesting to note [ bone 's ] advice regarding twitter accounts - i 'm sure many of us might share his view .", 
                "and when the tory mp tim loughton said that if twitter was serious about fighting hate crime online , rudd replied : i am sure that the chief executive of twitter will have heard the interesting suggestions from [ loughton ] and we will leave it to them to decide what action to take .", 
                "some mps suggested twitter and social media were bad for democracy .", 
                "the most striking interventions on this theme came from yvette cooper , the labour chair of the commons home affairs committee , and philip hollobone , a conservative .", 
                "cooper said : britain first gets is succour from spreading its poison and its extremism online .", 
                "that is how it works and the president of the united states has just given it a rocket boost in promoting hatred in our communities .", 
                "online is where the new battle for democracy is being fought and the prime minister has rightly challenged putin 's russia for what she described as seeking to weaponise information , to plant fake stories , in an attempt to sow discord we know from the plaque behind us [ commemorating jo cox ] and from our own history where the spread of extremism leads .", 
                "and hollobone said : for politicians , tweeting encourages the transmission of half-formed ideas , instead of listening to the developed arguments of others .", 
                "it prompts a culture of instant reaction instead of considered thought .", 
                "and it provokes people to immediate outrage instead of pauseful reflection .", 
                "rudd agreed with hollobone about it being important for politicians to pause and reflect before posting tweets .", 
                "john bercow , the commons speaker , took the unusual step of denouncing trump himself .", 
                "the speaker does not normally intervene in debates , or express any view on what mps are discussing .", 
                "but at the start of proceedings bercow explained why he was keen to allow the urgent question .", 
                "he said : i thought the house would want urgently to express support for the victims of racism and bigotry and to denounce their purveyors .", 
                "rudd was unable to say if the government has asked trump to take down his tweets .", 
                "when asked by the labour mp liz mcinnes if anyone had asked for the tweets to be taken down , rudd said she would have to get back to mcinnes with an answer .",

                "describing britain firs as an extremist organisation which seeks to divide communities through their use of hateful narratives which spread lies and stoke tensions , she said : president donald trump was wrong to retweet videos posted by the far-right group britain first .",
