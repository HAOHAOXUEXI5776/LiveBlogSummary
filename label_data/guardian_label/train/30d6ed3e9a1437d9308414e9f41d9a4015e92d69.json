                "on thursday , the abs issued a statement which said : the abs assures australians that there will be no personal identifiers on the survey form and all materials will be destroyed by the abs at the end of processing .", 
                "australian bureau of statistics statement as it appeared on 10 august on friday the abs amended the statement , which retains the assurance to destroy all material but removes the promise that there will be no personal identifiers .", 
                "i 've contacted the abs to ask why this promise has been removed , and what information will be collected about an individual other than their yes/no vote .",

                "it affects trust in government if i want to have my say but i am concerned about my vote being linked to me and used against me in some way the more people fear that , the more likely they are to not vote at all or to change their answers to what they think the government wants to hear .",

                "i have been told the original versions of the citizenship act 1977 ( nz ) provided for citizenship by descent to lapse if a birth overseas was not registered within a specified period .", 
                "however , i understand the lapsing provision was repealed after complaints , and citizenship restored to those whose citizenship had lapsed by amending acts passed in 2000 and 2001 .", 
                "these are the various links for those citizen journos who want to pursue this .",

                "( he entered parliament in the senate in 2005 . )", 
                "joyce said his parents had never registered his birth and his citizenship by descent .", 
                "in which case , it would have lapsed when he was a young man .", 
                "but the amendments of 2000-01 would have restored his citizenship by descent with effect from the date his citizenship had originally lapsed .", 
                "in other words , under current nz citizenship law , it may be that he is and always has been a new zealand citizen ."
