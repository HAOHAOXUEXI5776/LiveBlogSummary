                "peter dutton , last night , on sky news for many people , they wo n't be numerate or literate in their own language , let alone english , and this is a difficulty because the greens are very close to the cfmeu , as obviously the labor party is , and their affiliations with the union movement obviously are well known .", 
                "now , these people would be taking australian jobs , there 's no question about that , and for many of them that would be unemployed , they would languish in unemployment queues and on medicare and the rest of it .", 
                "so , there would be a huge cost , and there 's no sense in sugar-coating that , that 's the scenario .", 
                "now , we have a managed program at the moment , it 's 13,750 a year that we bring in through the refugee program , but we do n't bring people and we will not settle people who come off boats .", 
                "now , one of the little known policies that labor has put forward in this election campaign is that they want to double that number from 13,750 up to over 27,000 people .", 
                "now , that 's to try and buy off the left and hope in a campaign that they would n't break out the way in which we 've seen now more than 25 candidates do , that have broken out against labor 's policy .", 
                "but , as i say , there 's no sense pretending , paul , that if you said , \u0080\u0098look , we 're going to be super generous and take 50,000 and that will stop people smugglers putting people on boats ' , it 's a nonsense , because we know that there are hundreds of thousands frankly who would trek down through malaysia into indonesia that otherwise would have seen the door open in europe and would now see the door open to our country , and it would be an absolute green light .", 
                "and , you know , paul , i think in the run up to this election people want first and foremost from their leader , from a prospective prime minister , they want somebody with strength of character .", 
                "they want somebody that has the ability to keep their families and our community safe , and i think bill shorten has failed that test .", 
                "he 's demonstrated that he does n't have the mettle to stand up to his own backbench let alone to people smugglers and terrorists that would seek to do us harm that might seek to cross our borders , and i think malcolm turnbull demonstrated again today that he has the ability , the absolute determination to make sure that we keep our borders secure , and if we do that , we can keep our community safe .",

                "for more than 600 days , there has not been one successful people smuggling operation bringing unauthorised arrivals to australia .", 
                "he has done an outstanding job as immigration minister .",

                "what the labor party is proposing to do , as you know , is to double the refugee intake .", 
                "that is presumably a gesture to the greens who want to quadruple it .", 
                "but they have made no estimation of what the additional cost would be .",

                "nor have they considered whether we have the capacity in our settlement services to ensure those additional refugees are settled here .", 
                "to conclude on this point , we should never forget this - our success as a multicultural nation , our success depends upon secure borders .", 
                "australians accept this high level of refugee intake , this large humanitarian program because they know that their government keeps their borders secure .",
