                "here are the main points from david cameron 's appearance on question time .", 
                "cameron appeared to concede that remain was failing to persuade people in the campaign when he said that voters were finding the arguments perhaps quite confusing '' .", 
                "he made the point when asked why leave was in the lead .", 
                "he went on : i 've got four days to go .", 
                "i want to do better at getting this argument across .", 
                "he insisted that there was no silver bullet '' when it came to dealing with immigration .", 
                "and he defended the idea of getting net migration below 100,000 , although he described that as an ambition '' , not a target .", 
                "he summoned up the spirit of churchill to make the case against quitting the eu .", 
                "responding to a man in the audience who compared him to a 21st-century neville chamberlain waving a piece of paper in the air and saying to the public 'i have this promise ' '' ( a reference to cameron 's renegotiation ) , he said : if we choose to leave , we can leave but let 's be clear if we do leave we are walking out the door , we are quitting , we are giving up on this organisation which even if we leave will have a huge effect on our lives , our children , on our opportunities , on our businesses .", 
                "i do n't think britain at the end is a quitter .", 
                "i think we stay and fight .", 
                "that is what we should do .", 
                "that is what made our country great and that 's how it will be great in the future .", 
                "at my office i sit two yards away from the cabinet room where winston churchill decided in may 1940 to fight on against hitler - the best and greatest decision anyone has made in our country .", 
                "he did n't want to be alone , he wanted to be fighting with the french and with the poles and with the others but he did n't quit .", 
                "he did n't quit on europe , he did n't quit on european democracy , he did n't quit on european freedom .", 
                "we want to fight for those things today .", 
                "you ca n't win , you ca n't fight , if you are not in the room .", 
                "you ca n't win a football match if you are not on the pitch .", 
                "he came close to saying he would veto turkey joining the eu if it were to happen while he was prime minister .", 
                "he said : i 'm not going to be prime minister in three decades ' time .", 
                "if this was going to happen in the next couple of years i would not support it , but it is not going to .", 
                "but he said there was no need to give a cast-iron promise to veto turkey joining because it was not going to happen for decades .", 
                "accusing leave of not telling the truth about this , he said : i think this is the biggest red herring in this whole referendum debate .", 
                "i ca n't find a single expert anywhere in the country or in europe that thinks that turkey is going to join in the next three decades i feel strongly about this .", 
                "people are getting through their letter boxes leaflets from leave saying basically turkey is going to join the eu - not true .", 
                "but he also said that it was in britain 's interests to encourage turkey to think it could join the eu eventually because britain wanted it to be western-facing '' .", 
                "he said that it was impossible to know now why jo cox was killed , but that it was important to fight intolerance .", 
                "i think the most important thing for the politicians is to remember what [ cox ] was all about , which was service , community , tolerance .", 
                "these are values we should all try to live by and promote , in order to remember her .", 
                "i do n't think we know why exactly this happened or what the motivation was and we have to wait for the police investigation before we do that .", 
                "but i think what we do know is wherever we see intolerance , hatred , division , we should try and drive it out of our communities , out of our public life .", 
                "we have to be careful that debates can be passionate but we have to make sure that they are not based on those things .", 
                "he said leaving the eu would be irreversible .", 
                "i do believe it 's irreversible if we vote to leave , i do n't think there 's any prospect of rejoining .", 
                "if we were trying to rejoin we would have to join the single currency , we would have to join the schengen no-borders zone , give up the british rebate - so i would see no prospect of us rejoining .", 
                "this is a final decision .", 
                "you ca n't jump out of the aeroplane and then try to scramble back into the cockpit .", 
                "he defended his decision to say islamic state would welcome the uk leaving the eu .", 
                "i think the terrorists that want to do us harm want the west to be divided .", 
                "they do n't want britain and france and belgium and germany to work together to defeat terrorism .", 
                "they 'd like to see us separate from each other .", 
                "he defended george osborne 's claim that brexit would mean an emergency budget would be necessary this year .", 
                "that 's all from me for tonight .",
