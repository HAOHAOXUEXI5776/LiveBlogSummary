                "the construction of the olympic park was a powerful illustration of the way in which immigrants undercut uk workers through their willingness to endure family-unfriendly living conditions .", 
                "visiting job centres in east london at the time i met both skilled and unskilled workers who struggled to get work on the site .", 
                "when i asked why they said that people from eastern europe , often living in bedsits , without uk housing and family costs , hugely underbid them for their work .", 
                "since then those stories have been borne out by the facts .", 
                "despite the all the statements about the olympic park helping british workers , we now know that nearly half of all the jobs on the site went to foreign nationals the downward pressure on wages is a trend will only get worse if we continue to have open borders with the eu - and would get most difficult in a recession .", 
                "a bank of england study in december 2015 concluded : 'the biggest effect is in the semi/unskilled services sector , where a 10 percentage point rise in the proportion of immigrants is associated with a 2 percent reduction in pay ' .", 
                "this significantly affects british workers - especially those on low wages .", 
                "he said immigration made it harder for people to buy a home .",

                "we are going to see increasing divides between people who have a home of their own and those who are , to coin a phrase , at the back of a queue - a lengthening queue - to ever get on the housing ladder .",
