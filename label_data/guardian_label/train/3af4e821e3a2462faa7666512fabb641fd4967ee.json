                "here are the key points from monday 's article 50 committee stage debate .", 
                "ministers have comfortably seen off four opposition attempts to amend the article 50 bill .", 
                "further votes are due later on tuesday and on wednesday , but the fact that the government never came close to being defeated will raise theresa may 's hopes of getting the bill through the commons without any amendments to it being added .", 
                "( this is important because ministers believe the lords will be less likely to tinker with the bill if mps have left it unchanged . )", 
                "two labour amendments , on parliamentary oversight and consulting devolved bodies , were defeated by majorities of 49 and 57 respectively , an snp one on consulting with scotland was defeated by a majority of 270 , and a plaid cymru one calling for a report on the impact of brexit on wales was defeated by a majority of 63 .", 
                "kenneth clarke , the former chancellor , and other some other senior conservatives said the government should guarantee now that eu nationals living in the uk will not lose any of their rights after brexit .", 
                "the government does not want to promise this until britons living in other eu countries get their rights guaranteed .", 
                "but clarke told mps : if we just cleared the position of our eu nationals now , it would put the utmost pressure on every other country to clarify the thing as well .", 
                "no one is going to take any reprisals against our british nationals .", 
                "three other tories made the same argument : andrew tyrie , the chair of the treasury committee ( see 7.11pm ) , heidi allen ( see 7.20pm ) and sarah wollaston , the chair of the health committee ( see 8.10pm . )", 
                "mps did not vote on this topic tonight , but these interventions suggest ministers will face a rebellion on wednesday when a vote on this topic is expected to take place .", 
                "david jones , the brexit minister , said giving a unilateral guarantee to eu nationals living in the uk would mean a prolonged period of stressful uncertainty '' for britons living in other eu countries .", 
                "( see 8.45pm . )", 
                "echoing what theresa may said in her statement to mps earlier ( see 4.43pm ) , jones said the government wanted eu nationals living in the uk to get their rights guaranteed when britons on the continent get similar assurances .", 
                "in a separate speech the conservative richard fuller said germany 's angela merkel was to blame for the fact that a deal has not already been struck .", 
                "he said : i understand that it was mrs merkel who said no to a deal .", 
                "so where are our voices talking about pressuring the german government to make an agreement on that ?", 
                "i 've heard plenty of speeches today talking about donald trump and how we feel terrible about his policies .", 
                "well here 's something that affects british citizens in another country and not a word from anyone on that issue .", 
                "fuller said that while he was one of five tory mps to back a labour motion last year calling for the government to guarantee the rights of eu nationals in britain , he would not support any amendments to that effect now .", 
                "that was because theresa may had made this a priority , he said .", 
                "mark harper , the conservative former chief whip , was accused of filibustering .", 
                "he made two lengthy speeches at the start of both sections of the debate , leading to labour mps accusing him of trying to reduce the time available for opposition mps to promote their amendments .",

                "this is what tories mean by democratic participation and this is from labour 's maria eagle .", 
                "maria eagle mp ( @ meaglemp ) tory ministers have got filibustering backbencher to use up what little time there is for amendments to # article50bill snp mps also complained angrily that only two of their mps were called in the three-hour section of the debate specifically allocated for amendments relating to the devolved legislatures .", 
                "the conservative mp alberto costa said that his party should abandon its target to get net migration below 100,000 because no competent british government '' would implement a policy so damaging to the economy .", 
                "( see 8.32pm . )", 
                "the conservative mp anna soubry indicated that she was willing to vote against the government unless it gave mps a proper vote on the brexit outcome .", 
                "she said she backed the proposal in nc110 , an amendment tabled by labour 's chris leslie which would stop the government signing a brexit treaty with the european commission until mps and peers have agreed it .", 
                "she said : i have made it very clear that i very much hope that the government will see the good sense as has been put forward in much of the wording of new clause 110 and some sort of compromise and sense can be achieved .", 
                "but i make it very clear : in the absence of that i will find myself perhaps with no alternative but to go against my government , the last thing i want to do .", 
                "but soubry , who is one of may 's strongest tory critics on brexit , said that she disagreed with calls for eu nationals in the uk to have their rights guaranteed now because she trusted may on this issue .",

                "the former shadow foreign secretary said that the conservative party 's annual conference was an absolute disaster '' because senior politicians portrayed an image of the uk that was insular and aggressive towards foreigners .", 
                "indicating that such language could influence future negotiations with the eu , he also said making pronouncements about what the government would achieve from its discussions would harden attitudes towards the uk among european politicians and officials .", 
                "benn , speaking at the institute for government 's headquarters in central london , said that ministers had damaged the uk 's reputation .", 
                "when i reflect upon a certain week in birmingham in the autumn , where people of a particular political party gathered and made speeches , i thought that was a disastrous week for britain 's reputation in the world .", 
                "absolutely disastrous , '' he said .", 
                "because to produce headlines saying 'crackdown on foreign students ' - when i last checked i was n't aware that foreign students were a problem that we need to crack down upon , it is ridiculous to have them in the net migration target - or saying that doctors who have brought their skills come to this country can stay in the interim while we train more of our own doctor , it sent a message at that point that we are closing in on ourselves as a nation .", 
                "that 's not what who we are it is not what britain is .", 
                "we will thrive in the future by being a welcoming country , '' he said .", 
                "ministers should also stop claiming they will achieve certain goals from the negotiations before they begin because it will only harden the opinions of those britain is negotiating with , benn said .", 
                "the second difficulty has been people sitting there saying 'we are going to get the following ' - well the 27 are thinking 'we will see about that ' it would be prudent to change the tone , '' he said ."
