                "here is a summary .", 
                "starmer said that labour would ensure that britain does not just implement existing eu laws guaranteeing worker rights and environmental standards too , but future ones too .", 
                "he made this clear when he said labour would replace the conservatives ' great repeal bill with an eu rights and protections bill .",

                "this marks a key dividing line with the conservatives , and it would help a labour government negotiate a deal guaranteeing good access to the single market , because the eu would not have to worry about the uk cutting standards post brexit to make its economy more competitive .", 
                "but such an assurance would also make it harder for a labour government to explain what was the point in the uk leaving the eu in the first place .",

                "this does mark another dividing line with theresa may ; the conservatives are taking the uk out of the single market because may believes that regaining control of immigration must take priority , and this is incompatible with single market membership , because countries have to accept free movement to be in the single market .",
