                "greg dyke , chairman of the football association , has told mps that he will consider whether england could try to recover the money spent on bidding for the 2018 world cup in the light of an interview given by sepp blatter saying there was an agreement before the vote to give it to russia .", 
                "giving evidence to the commons culture committee , dyke said : we will look in detail at what mr blatter says .", 
                "i suspect the response [ from him ] will be 'i was misquoted ' , but if he says that then i think there is something to investigate .",
