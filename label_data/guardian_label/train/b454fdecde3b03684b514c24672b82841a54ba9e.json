                "as the guardian reports , 76 mps - mostly , but not exclusively , tory pro-leave campaigners - have signed a letter to the bbc complaining about its brexit coverage .", 
                "they are particularly angry about what they dub despite brexit '' coverage , by which they seem to mean reporting that pre-supposes brexit will damage the economy .", 
                "( growth and employment figures have been positive since last june , and claims that a leave vote would trigger an immediate downturn turned out to be wrong , but it remains the case that most economists think that when the uk does leave the eu there will be a hit to growth in the short and medium term . )", 
                "here is an extract from the letter containing the mps ' key arguments .", 
                "we know many leave-voting constituents have felt their view have been unfairly represented .", 
                "this phenomenon is weakening the bbc 's bond with the 52 % who voted leave and all who wish to make a success of the decision made .", 
                "in particular , the corporation 's focus on 'regretful ' leave voters , despite there being no polling shift towards remain since the referendum , has led some to believe it is putting its preconceptions before the facts .", 
                "meanwhile the posturing and private opinions of eu figures are too often presented as facts , without the vital context that they are talking tough ahead of the exit negotiations .", 
                "it particularly pains us to see how much of the economic good news we 've had since june has been skewed by bbc coverage which seems unable to break out of pre-referendum pessimism and accept new facts .", 
                "some of the signatories of this letter shared many of the concerns about theeconomic impact of brexit , but all are delighted to find forecasts of immediate economic harm were at best misplaced .", 
                "so-called 'despite brexit ' reporting may be expected of a partisan press , but licence fee-payers have the right to expect better coverage also shapes international perceptions of the uk : we fear that , by misrepresenting our country either as xenophobic or regretful of the leave vote , the bbc will undermine our efforts to carve out a new , global role for this country .", 
                "here is the guardian 's story about it .", 
                "you can read the full text of the letter here , on the website of julian knight , the conservative mp and former bbc and independent journalist who coordinated it .", 
                "he voted remain.is 'failing in its duty to be impartial over brexit ' read more in response tom watson , labour 's deputy leader and the shadow culture secretary , has urged the government to stand up for the bbc .", 
                "in a statement he said : the bbc is one of the world 's finest news broadcasters and we should all value its impartiality , integrity and balanced coverage .", 
                "it is the bbc 's job to report the facts , not to be a cheerleader for any cause or party .", 
                "all politicians sometimes dislike the way some stories are covered , but we should never seek to interfere with the independence of the bbc by publicly accusing it of bias and making implicit threats about its future .", 
                "theresa may and karen bradley must make clear their commitment to the independence of the bbc and distance themselves from attacks on it by politicians who have an agenda the bbc does not and should not share .",
