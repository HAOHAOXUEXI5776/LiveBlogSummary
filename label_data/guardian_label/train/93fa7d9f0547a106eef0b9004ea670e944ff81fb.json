                "the european central bank 's governing council is meeting in frankfurt to set monetary policy , and we 're all expecting a new dose of stimulus measures .", 
                "with inflation at just 0.1 % , unemployment still over 10 % and bank lending disappointing , draghi has plenty of excuses to ease monetary policy further .", 
                "economists expect the ecb to extend its quantitative easing programme ; it could commit to buy more government bonds each month , or run the programme for longer .", 
                "it is also expected to hit banks with sharper negative interest rates ; that would encourage them to stop leaving money in the ecb 's vaults .", 
                "the interest rate decision comes at 12.45pm gmt ( 1.45pm frankfurt time ) , followed by mario draghi 's press conference 45 minutes later .", 
                "there is a danger that the markets could be disappointed by the ecb 's news , simply because investors are united in expecting new stimulus measures .", 
                "more easing is 'priced in ' , in city jargon .", 
                "but draghi rarely lets us down , so he could well unleash some fireworks in his press conference .", 
                "also coming up today unions in greece have called a general strike , to protest against the government 's pension cuts .", 
                "new surveys of europe 's service sector are released this morning by markit .", 
                "the european commission is to open a state aid investigation into suspected sweetheart tax arrangements enjoyed by mcdonald 's in luxembourg .", 
                "and janet yellen , head of the federal reserve , is testifying to the joint economic committee of the us congress , from 3pm gmt .",
