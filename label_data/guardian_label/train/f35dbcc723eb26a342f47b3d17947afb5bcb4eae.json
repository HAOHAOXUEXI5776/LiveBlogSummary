                "this budget will be remembered for the sugar tax - which not only caught pundits by surprise ( not least because they had made the mistake of believing briefing to the effect that it was off the table ) but also allowed george osborne to indulge his inner big state interventionist - but it did not feel like a big , transformative one .", 
                "lifetime isas could potentially have a significant effect on the pensions industry , because osborne is giving 20-somethings an alternative to saving in a pension , but it is equally possible that they will be abolished a few years down the line because they prove too expensive ( like child trust funds ) .", 
                "the business rate cuts will make a difference to small shopkeepers , some of the devolutionary measures were probably welcome ( unless you work in a council education department , where every school an academy could put you out of a job ) , but generally , as budgets go , this was nearer the routine end of the scale than the historic .", 
                "in a budget which involves a modest fiscal tightening this year osborne also managed to announce proper tax cuts ; a rise in the basic rate tax allowance , worth almost \u00e2\u00a3 2bn by 2020 , an increase in the higher rate allowance worth \u00e2\u00a3 600m by 2020 , and a cut in capital gains tax , worth \u00e2\u00a3 735m by 2020 , that will mainly benefit shareholders .", 
                "osborne does not produce the transparent distributional analysis that he did in the last parliament - he explains why here ( pdf ) - but presumably the institute for fiscal studies will enlighten us tomorrow .", 
                "there are already claims that the top 10 % of households will get a third of the benefit from the income tax cuts .", 
                "meanwhile the disabled will lose \u00e2\u00a3 1.3bn by 2020 from the cuts to the personal independence payment .", 
                "the big story is probably in the overall economic figures which , overall , are grim for the chancellor ; there is a \u00e2\u00a3 55bn black hole in his finances .", 
                "as the resolution foudnation 's torsten bell says , osborne has discovered that what the sofa gives , the sofa can take away .",

                "in a cheeky move , the office for budget responsibility has even tweeted his current scorecard : one out of three .",
