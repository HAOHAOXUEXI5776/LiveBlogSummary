                "benn said leaving the eu would not reduce immigration significantly '' .", 
                "immigration into britain will continue whether we stay or go , as the leave campaign have now admitted .",

                "and anyone who thinks that voting leave will bring the numbers down significantly will in time be bitterly disappointed .", 
                "free movement is part of the deal and the reason why so many people have come here from other eu countries is because jobs are available .", 
                "jobs that need doing and jobs that , if it had not been for this migration , employers would have been shouting about because of the difficulty they were having in filling them .", 
                "vacancies for doctors , nurses , lecturers , factory workers , chefs and waiters , receptionists , scientists and cleaners .", 
                "he suggested britain needed to keep net migration relatively high because of the growing need for carers .", 
                "just reflect for a moment on the greatest social challenge that confronts us ; the demographic time bomb that will see the number of people aged 65 and over rise by nearly five million over the next two decades .", 
                "already , one in five of our care workers come from outside the united kingdom - from europe and the rest of the world - and we will need more carers as more people need looking after .", 
                "when my father came towards the end of his life , most of the people who cared for him with such patience and gentleness had brought their care from abroad to this country .", 
                "and in the years ahead , it will be our turn to be looked after .", 
                "and as well as providing that care , we will need to pay for it , which is why it is utterly irresponsible to advocate a course of action that will lead to a weaker , less strong and less prosperous economy .", 
                "this would damage our public services and make it more difficult to deal with , as we must , the pressures that immigration brings .", 
                "benn did not quite say it , but his implied message was : vote brexit , but only if you 're willing to provide the care for your ageing parents yourself .", 
                "he implied that if leave really wanted to cut immigration , they would have to crash the economy .",

                "well , we can influence the level , but not in the way the leave campaigners think they can .",

                "he said britain had always influenced the world by looking outwards .",
