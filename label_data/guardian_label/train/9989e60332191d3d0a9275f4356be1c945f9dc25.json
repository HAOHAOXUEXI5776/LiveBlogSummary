                "today is a-level results day , when tens of thousands of teenagers around the country will find out the grades that will determine whether they go to university and where .", 
                "as soon as they manage to drag themselves out of bed , sixth-formers across britain will be anxiously awaiting their results , though email and remote log-ins have replaced the traditional envelope from this year .", 
                "students have complained of extra stress from sitting new , untested qualifications this summer for which many felt ill prepared , with no past papers , no mark schemes and no clarity about grade boundaries .", 
                "many complained that the changes had been rushed , with teachers and students struggling to master new syllabuses , hindered by few sparse materials and out-of-date textbooks .", 
                "the pressure was compounded by the fact that the new qualifications are solely assessed on end-of-year exams , rather than coursework and as-levels halfway through .", 
                "ministers and teachers will also be watching the results closely , in particular for changes in the share of a and a grades , which has fallen in the past five years .", 
                "the proportion of top grades awarded in 2011 was 27 % , but by last year that slid to 25.8 % .", 
                "nevertheless , sally collier , england 's chief exam regulator , has pledged that a-level grades will be fair .", 
                "ofqual uses a calculation known as comparable outcomes '' to link a-level grades to results achieved by the same pupils at gcse , to guard against grade inflation and to ensure that the grades of each year group reflect its ability overall .", 
                "the changes have seen new formats for a-levels in 13 subjects and the decoupling of as-levels as an integral part of two-year a-level courses .", 
                "the reformed exams include many popular subjects , such as english , history , physics , biology , chemistry and psychology .", 
                "but others , including maths , will not be examined in their new form for the first time until next year ."
