                "here are the main points from david davis 's commons statement on brexit .", 
                "davis dismissed calls for mps to have a vote on the government 's brexit negotiating terms .", 
                "the former labour leader ed miliband and the former lib dem leader and former deputy prime minister nick clegg were among those arguing that parliament should be consulted .", 
                "miliband said : there is clearly a mandate for brexit from this referendum but there is no mandate for the particular form of brexit .", 
                "and clegg said : on the basis of what constitutional principle do you believe that the prime minister can now arrogate to herself the exclusive right to interpret what brexit means , impose it upon the country , rather than protect the rightful role of scrutiny and approval of this house ?", 
                "some tory mps made the same point .", 
                "but davis argued that those arguing for the commons to decide negotiating terms can not tell the difference between accountability and micro-management '' .", 
                "he said that mps would get plenty of chances to debate the issue .", 
                "but , dismissing calls for mps to be given a binding vote on the brexit negotiations , he said that it was important for the government to be able to negotiate what it thought was in the national interest without being constrained by having to declare full details of its negotiating position to mps .", 
                "speaking for labour , the shadow brexit secretary sir keir starmer said mps should get a vote on the basic terms '' of the renegotiation .", 
                "davis refused to commit the government to publishing a white paper on the brexit negotiations .", 
                "he proposed one in an article he wrote as a backbencher in july , shortly before he was appointed to the cabinet , but , despite being asked repeatedly , refused to commit the government to publishing such document .", 
                "he claimed that the terms hard '' and soft '' brexit were designed to deceive '' and not meaningful in any way '' .", 
                "he hinted that the government might accept a transitional trade deal with the eu if it could not agree a final one within two years .", 
                "labour 's hilary benn said a transitional deal might be necessary to stop the uk having to trade with the eu on world trade organisation terms if , after two years , a permanent trade deal has not been finalised .", 
                "benn asked if davis agreed .", 
                "davis said he did not expect this to happen .", 
                "but he went on : i 'm not going to offer a view .", 
                "i will just simply say this ; we are going to do everything possible to protect , enhance and maximise the opportunities for british business .", 
                "and he can draw his conclusion .", 
                "he said that the government could not stop the pound going up and down during the brexit process .", 
                "in response to a question from labour 's emma reynolds about why the pound dropped to a 30-year low after the conservative conference , he replied : i recommend you read a book called flash boys because part of that fall , the major part of that fall was the flash crash as a result of that .", 
                "otherwise , there are lots and lots of speculative comments that will drive the pound down and up and down and up in the next two-and-a-half years and there 's little we can do about that .", 
                "he said there would be no downside to brexit and only considerable upsides '' if the government got what it wanted .", 
                "the government had four goals , he said .", 
                "one is to regain control of our borders .", 
                "another is to get back control of our laws .", 
                "the one i did not list was our aim to keep our justice and security arrangements at least as strong as they are .", 
                "finally , and most importantly in this context , the united kingdom must aim to maintain the best possible open access to european markets and vice versa .", 
                "if we can achieve all that , there will be no downside to brexit at all , and considerable upsides .", 
                "he said he expected eu leaders to compromise during the brexit talks .", 
                "what they were saying now was not what they would be saying in the future , he said .", 
                "see 5.22pm .", 
                "he tried to reassure eu nationals living in the uk that they would be allowed to stay , saying most of them would have the legal right to remain anyway .", 
                "in terms of the individuals who are european migrants here and british citizens abroad , my intention and the intention of the government , is to do everything possible to underwrite their position , to guarantee their position , at the same time as we underwrite the similar position of british migrants abroad i do n't think people should worry people unnecessarily , get people concerned .", 
                "bear in mind five out of six migrants either have or will have ilr , indefinite leave to remain , by the time we depart the union .", 
                "he refused to commit the government to retaining single market membership .", 
                "asked about this , he said : the single market , of course , is one description of the way the european union operates but there are plenty of people who have access to the single market , some of them tariff-free , who make a great success of that access and it 's the success we are aiming for .", 
                "that 's all from me for tonight .", 
                "thanks for the comments .", 
                "update : i have updated one of the paragraphs above to include the full quote where david davis was talking about no downside to brexit to make it clear that he was saying this on the assumption the government got what it wanted ."
