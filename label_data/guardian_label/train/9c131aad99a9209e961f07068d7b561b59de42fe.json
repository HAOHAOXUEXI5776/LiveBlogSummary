                "kenton for the guardian mike thorne says : i enjoyed your observations on wagner on start the week : i 'm not trying to diss w , who was an ambivalent figure at best .", 
                "do you think as shown at the end of die maestersinger he was interested in german nationalism , or was that about a preferred type of german art ?", 
                "guardian contributor simoncallowwebchat 30 january 2017 2:03pm i think it 's quite important with wagner to distinguish between german nationalism as espoused by the new german reich , from wagner 's conception of a cultural phenomenon , which is a fundamental kind of teutonic conception of life .", 
                "which is semi-mystical , and almost anthropological , with its roots as wagner conceived of it , in pre-history .", 
                "whether this is an attractive or real thing or not is obviously a matter for discussion , but it 's a different thing from a specific nationalism of a kind that wagner was increasingly prevalent in the 19th century across europe and beyond .", 
                "wagner was intellectually an extraordinary mix of influences , he was never as far as i know a marxist - he certainly read feuerbach .", 
                "and his vision at least until he discovered schopenhauer , was libertarian and anarchist in the sense that he believed that authority was an inherent ill and the people and the the people 's will was paramount , and the sooner that authoritarian structures were dismantled , the sooner humankind would live productively .", 
                "it is an anarchist view , technically , although he did n't want to throw bombs at people ( though he was briefly involved in that ) - it involved trust in your fellow humans , and that the law will fall away eventually , because people will live happily together if they are not oppressed .", 
                "in wagner 's case it becomes more complex because he believes the people can only be true to themselves if they 're true to their roots , the roots of their own community , their own tribe .", 
                "he felt a tribe is conceived very differently from a nation - an entity that has profound connections to its own traditions , language , culture .", 
                "this can not simply be acquired , because if you come from the outside , you can never be an authentic member of the community .", 
                "and he believes that people are at their best expressing themselves culturally , in music or literature or art , and anyone who comes from the outside and tries to engage with those activities will not be authentic .", 
                "that 's the story of thinking he was engaging in , and he did it by plunging into anthropological studies , the rituals of his tribe the teutons , and entertained some fanciful notions that they were the aristocracy of the globe .", 
                "you can see where his thinking and hitler 's merge , but hitler 's was a political and militaristic , authoritarian and centralised organisation .", 
                "the maestersinger is an aberration in wagner 's work - he proclaimed it absurd and demeaning to de psychologically complex human beings in a realistic way onstage , what one had to do was connect to myths and archetypes , whereas the setting of die maestersinger is bourgeois .", 
                "he realises it with great affection and detail , and breaks all his own rules about not writing arias or duets or ensembles .", 
                "he writes in fact the most opera-like opera he wrote .", 
                "it contains a great deal of sometimes abstruse philosophising , but in the end of the piece he does indeed celebrate german art .", 
                "it 's a source of now huge embarrassment to germans themselves .", 
                "in the production by his granddaughter i saw a few years ago , it was relentlessly attacked in the production , this notion of german art , but the music that expresses it is as tender and lyrical and affirmative as can be - there 's nothing militant about it .", 
                "but it sticks in our craw to even hear the words spoken , because of all the associations with the third reich .", 
                "there 's no point in me defending him - it 's important to explain his thinking though , and not tar everything with one brush .", 
                "`` wagner was a nazi ! ''", 
                "- he was n't at all , though some of his views were extremely unpalatable .", 
                "which relates to this idea of the inauthenticity of outsiders - to him , jews were rootless outsiders who came into his culture , and having no culture of their own as he saw it , simply imitated the culture they found .", 
                "and extraordinarily the person he attacked was mendelssohn , though i defy anything to find anything jewish about his work , except a sonata with a jewish melody .", 
                "but wagner insisted he was a fraud , his music shallow , and a cheap imitation to a form he could n't write - because he was n't german .", 
                "and that 's where this little anthem to german art becomes uncomfortable .", 
                "but in answer to your question - it is n't about german nationalism as bismarck or hitler understood it - it 's about a dream of the german soul , which as i said , has itself a very bad name .", 
                "but i suppose here in britain we do n't think about britishness until very recently - but we 're starting to bureaucratise that .", 
                "we do have some sense of what it means too , as with elgar , which we think could only be written by an english composer .", 
                "it 's a complicated situation .", 
                "you 'll find very little nationalistic music in wagner , no folk tunes ."

                "it 's unlike anything he shot before , in some areas , parts of it are satirical on other filmmakers like antonioni whose work he despised , and in some ways it has a possibly autobiographical dimension in that the central character , jake hannaford , is a legendary filmmaker stuck with his current film , and has an immensely complicated relationship to its leading man .", 
                "this is played by no less a person that john huston , and one of the fascinations of the material is that huston and welles were strangely similar characters in hollywood , but their careers were absolutely different .",
