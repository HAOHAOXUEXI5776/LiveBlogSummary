                "the fifth year anniversary of the sandy hook elementary school shooting last december passed quietly , with congressional republicans refusing to pass new gun control laws , and instead pushing for a law that would weaken gun restrictions nationwide and make it easier to carry a concealed weapon across state lines .",
