                "last night the labour party issued some extracts from jeremy corbyn 's speech at labour 's local election campaign launch .", 
                "he was quoted as saying : how can you not be angry and demand major change when life expectancy in britain for pensioners and those aged 45 is falling ?", 
                "the press notice repeated the point about life expectancy falling another three times .",

                "but this morning , as he delivered his speech , corbyn said it was mcloughlin who had made a mistake .", 
                "the labour leader told his audience : whether the conservative party chair can face the facts or not , life expectancy has actually fallen - by a year for 65-year-old women and 6 months for 65-year-old men - since 2013 .", 
                "analysis so , who 's right ?", 
                "is life expectancy falling ?", 
                "unusually in a row about data , the conservatives and labour are both using the same source material .", 
                "they have both referred reporters to a report from the institute and faculty of actuaries ' continuous mortality investigation ( cmi ) .", 
                "the cmi is constantly revising life expectancy data ( because actuaries need to know long people will live , not least so the pensions industry can plan ) and at the end of last month it released its latest mortality projections model - cmi 2016 '' .", 
                "a working paper summarising cmi 2016 says that the rate at which life expectancy is improving is slowing down .", 
                "the crucial paragraph , which labour referred me to when i asked for the evidence to back up what corbyn was saying , says that , as a result of the rate of improvement slowing down , forecasts for life expectancy are now lower than they were .", 
                "the model suggests that mortality improvements peaked some time ago with the highest improvements being seen in 2004 for males and 2006 for females .", 
                "consequently the direction of travel '' of mortality improvements is negative .", 
                "the combination of lower initial mortality improvements and amended projection assumptions leads to lower life expectancies than in all previous versions of the model .", 
                "compared to cmi 2015 , life expectancies at age 65 are 1.3 % lower for males and 2.0 % lower for females in cmi 2016 , and falls in life expectancy are greater at the oldest ages .", 
                "the bbc reported this under the headline : pensioners ' life expectancy falls back '' .", 
                "and the independent published the story under the headline : uk life expectancy among pensioners drops for first time in decades . ''",

                "but the institute and faculty of actuaries has also sent me the press release it issued to mark the publication of cmi 2016 .", 
                "and this explicitly says that , although life expectancy is not improving as quickly as it was , it is still going up .", 
                "it says : recent population data has highlighted that , since 2011 , the rate at which mortality is improving has been slower than in previous years .", 
                "however , mortality is expected to continue to improve and there is significant uncertainty as to whether this will be at a slower rate than experienced in the first decade of this century .", 
                "conclusion on a narrow point , corbyn can defend what he is saying : life expectancy forecasts ( at least , the cmi 's ) are going down .", 
                "but that is not the same as saying life expectancy is going down .",
