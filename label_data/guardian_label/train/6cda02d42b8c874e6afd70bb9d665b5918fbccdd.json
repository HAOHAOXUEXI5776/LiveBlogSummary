                "let 's walk through carefully what we learned over the past several hours .", 
                "under cross examination from counsel assisting , jeremy stoljar , here is what labor leader bill shorten told the trade union royal commission on wednesday : a labour hire firm kicked in to pay the wages of his campaign director for the federal seat of maribynong in 2007 but the $ 40,000 donation had only been declared to the australian electoral commission on july 6 .", 
                "the wages of the campaign director were also topped up by the australian workers union .", 
                "that was only declared on july 6 .", 
                "shorten said a full declaration was made once the omission had come to his attention , and once his legal team had been able to gather the relevant facts about the arrangement .", 
                "he made the point that amendments to the electoral returns are commonplace , which is correct .", 
                "shorten was accused by stoljar of using his position at the awu for personal gain a comment the labor leader dismissed categorically .", 
                "he told the royal commission it was entirely possible to separate personal interests and relationships from the duty of a trade union official to look after the interests of workers .", 
                "the afternoon was spent largely on a workplace agreement covering workers at cleanevent .", 
                "shorten said he was not fully across the fine print of the agreement , but he was guided in assuming it was adequate by advice from awu officials , and by a positive vote by the workers at cleanevent .", 
                "by the end of the afternoon , shorten acknowledged that the awu 's statutory declaration to the industrial commission about the cleanevent deal may not have contained facts it should have contained , and he reasoned this placed him in exactly the same position as the industrial relations commission .", 
                "both shorten and the irc relied on advice to clear the deal .", 
                "there was more , but those were the main points .",
