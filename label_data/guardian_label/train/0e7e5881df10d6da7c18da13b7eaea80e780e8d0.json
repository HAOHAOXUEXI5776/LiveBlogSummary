                "from guardian us opinion editor megan carpentier : texas senator ted cruz learned the hard way that playing to the audience in the house might not play well with the debate moderators , when he used his time on a substantive question about his economic policies particularly on the debt limit to insult the cnbc reporters asking some hard-hitting questions of all the candidates .", 
                "cruz who eventually got 30 seconds to answer the question decided to use his initial time to earn kudos from the audience for noting that none of the members of the media moderating the debate would be voting in the republican primary and so , he alleged , they should be nicer to the candidates .", 
                "( in fairness to cruz , the debate which started off with a pro-forma interview question about each candidate 's weakness , turned heated quickly as moderators sought to contrast candidates ' positions with economic realities and actual , you know , math . )", 
                "but while cruz earned a round of applause from an audience that is , by now , completely accustomed to republicans shrieking about the mainstream media 's liberal bias , to viewers at home , asking carson to explain how he 'd plug the deficit by converting all taxes to tithes and then following up when he could n't answer the question is supposed to be a debate moderator 's job .",
