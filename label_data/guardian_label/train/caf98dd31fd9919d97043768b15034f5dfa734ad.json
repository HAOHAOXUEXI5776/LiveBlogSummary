                "we also produce evidence that lower-quality service provision in the national health service is associated with the success of vote leave our regressions allow for a counterfactual analysis .", 
                "we find that relatively modest reductions in fiscal cuts at the local authority level ( less than \u00a3 50 per person ) may have been sufficient to lead to the opposite referendum outcome , pushing the vote leave share below 50 percent .", 
                "the overall reductions in fiscal cuts would have amounted to less than \u00a3 3 billion in total for the uk .",

                "but they say reducing immigration from eastern europe may not have affected the result .", 
                "a reduction in migration from eastern europe , which could have been achieved by opting to phase in freedom of movement in 2004 ( which much of the rest of europe did ) , could have also reduced the margin of victory for the leave campaign , but would have been unlikely to overturn the referendum result we also find strong evidence that the growth rate of migrants from the 12 eu accession countries that joined the eu in 2004 and 2007 is tightly linked to the vote leave share .", 
                "this stands in contrast to migrant growth from the eu 15 countries or elsewhere in the world .", 
                "we therefore conclude that migration from predominantly eastern european countries has had a distinct effect on voters .", 
                "however , we can not identify the precise mechanism - whether the effect on voters is mainly economic through competition in the labour and housing markets , or rather in terms of changing social conditions .",

                "however , despite significant popular support for ukip , the party is essentially not represented in the national parliament , implying that a significant share of voters lack formal access to the political system through representation of their views .", 
                "at the same time , the strong popular support has rightfully attracted media attention .", 
                "but it has come with no obligation for far-right politicians to assume roles of responsibility towards their electorate by exercising executive power we argue that the 'westminster bubble ' is key to understanding the voting outcome .", 
                "the under-representation of anti-eu parties in the british parliament is likely a crucial contributing factor to the lack of attention paid in the political process to struggling areas , especially in england and wales .", 
                "as a result of the first-past-the-post voting system , ukip currently only has one member of parliament in the house of commons out of over 600 , despite the fact that ukip came first in the most recent european parliament elections .", 
                "ukip representatives are therefore hardly in positions of political responsibility and thus largely escape media scrutiny .", 
                "it may therefore be appropriate to consider ways of introducing more proportional representation into british politics .", 
                "but , remember , just because something gets published by academics , that does not mean it is necessarily correct .",

                "as the authors write , geographic variation in the size of the fiscal cuts captures the underlying baseline degree of demand for benefits : the places with highest demand for benefits were naturally more affected in other words : cuts were more severe in poorer areas .", 
                "if poorer areas were more likely to vote leave , then anything which is associated with poorer areas will also ( probably but not necessarily ) end up being associated with the leave vote , and might therefore emerge as a predictor of the leave vote purely in virtue of this connection .",
