                "i wrote that book when i was in my late 20s and early 30s , and i think i had stumbled across something that was important then , but is even more important now , given everything that has happened with networks since i wrote it .",

                "in the mid-90s when i was writing that book , this was not a particularly widespread practice ; most people wrote about technology as product reviews ( `` i give this new version of microsoft word three and a half mice ! '' )", 
                "so i was , in writing interface culture and i was not the only person writing this way but there were a lot less of us trying to make the case that software had to be conceptualised through a much wider lens .",
