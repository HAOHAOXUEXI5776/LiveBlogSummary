                "david cameron has used a commons statement to attempt to close down the controversy about his family finances and his involvement in an offshore fund .", 
                "he told mps that he accepted his handling of his issue last week had been flawed , but he claimed that his decision at the weekend to publish information from his tax returns for the last six years was unprecedented '' .", 
                "he spoke about his finances in some detail but sidestepped certain questions - most notably one from jeremy corbyn about whether any of the shares worth \u00a3 70,000 sold by cameron in 2010 ( in addition to the blairmore holdings shares ) were held offshore .", 
                "number 10 has refused to say they confirm they were onshore .", 
                "( see 12.49pm . )", 
                "jeremy corbyn gave a spirited response accusing cameron of failing to address wider issues of inequality , but cameron received strong support from his mps and by the end it looked as if he had pulled off a reasonably competent damage limitation exercise .", 
                "cameron told mps that , although he was calling for prime ministers , chancellors and their official opposition counterparts to publish their tax information , he did not believe it was right to enforce transparency on mps or public figures more generally .", 
                "i think there is a strong case for the prime minister and the leader of the opposition , and for the chancellor and shadow chancellor , because they are people who are or who wish to be responsible for the nation 's finances .", 
                "as for mps , we already have robust rules on members ' interests and their declaration and i believe that is the model we should continue to follow .", 
                "we should think carefully before abandoning completely all taxpayer confidentiality in this house as some have suggested .", 
                "if this were to come in for mps , people would also ask for a similar approach for those who ask us questions , those who run large public services , or lead local government , or indeed those who edit the news programmes or newspapers .", 
                "i think this would be a very big step for our country , it certainly should n't take place without a long and thoughtful debate and it is not the approach that i would recommend .", 
                "cameron said the allegations about his late father having been engaged in tax avoidance were deeply hurtful and profoundly untrue '' .", 
                "he said he was proud of his father : i know he was a hard-working man and a wonderful dad and i 'm proud of everything he did to build a business and provide for his family .", 
                "he said organisations like the bbc and the guardian have money invested offshore in funds like the one set up by his father .", 
                "describing blairmore holdings , he said : this investment fund was set up overseas in the first place because it was going to be trading predominantly in dollar securities .", 
                "so like very many other commercial investment funds it made sense to be set up inside one of the main centres of dollar trading .", 
                "there are thousands of these investment funds , and many millions of people in britain who own shares , many of whom hold them through investment funds or unit trusts .", 
                "such funds , including those listed outside the uk , are included in the pension funds of local government , most of britain 's largest companies , and indeed even some trade unions .", 
                "even a quick look shows that the bbc , the mirror group , guardian newspapers , and to one council entirely at random - islington - all have these sorts of overseas investments .", 
                "this is an entirely standard practice and it is not to avoid tax .", 
                "he said did not respond to the allegations about his investments earlier because he was angry about what was being said about his father .", 
                "i accept all of the criticisms for not responding more quickly to these issues last week but as i said i was angry about the way my father 's memory was being traduced .", 
                "corbyn said cameron did not appreciate how angry members of the public were about tax avoidance .", 
                "responding to cameron , corbyn said : may i thank you for the advance sight of your statement , it is absolutely a masterclass in the art of distraction .", 
                "i 'm sure you will join me in welcoming the outstanding journalism that has gone into exposing the scandal of destructive global tax avoidance revealed by the panama papers .", 
                "what they have driven home is what many people have increasingly felt - there is now one rule for the super-rich and another for the rest .", 
                "i 'm honestly not sure that you fully appreciate the anger that is out there over this injustice .", 
                "corbyn also published his own tax return .", 
                "labour confirmed he paid a \u00a3 100 fine because he submitted it late .", 
                "the labour mp dennis skinner was suspended from the chamber for calling cameron dodgy dave '' .", 
                "he asked cameron : does the prime minister recall that at the time after he became prime minister under the coalition and at the time when he was dividing the nation between strivers and scroungers , i asked him a very important question about the windfall he received when he wrote off the mortgage of the premises in notting hill , and i said to him he did n't write off the mortgage of the one taxpayers were helping to pay for at oxford .", 
                "i did n't receive a proper answer then .", 
                "maybe dodgy dave will answer it now .", 
                "john bercow , the speaker , asked skinner to withdraw the word dodgy '' ( it is against parliamentary rules to use an insult like that in the chamber ) and he suspended skinner for the rest of the day when skinner refused .", 
                "cameron never answered the question .", 
                "george osborne has released a summary of his tax return for last year showing he earned almost \u00a3 200,000 by topping up his chancellor 's salary with rental income and dividends from his family 's wallpaper firm .", 
                "sir alan duncan , the conservative former minister and former oil trader , said the commons could end up being stuffed full of low-achievers '' if mps had to publish their tax returns .", 
                "he asked cameron : should n't the prime minister 's critics really just snap out of the synthetic indignation and admit that their real point is that they hate anyone who has got a hint of wealth in them ?", 
                "may i support the prime minister in fending off those who are attacking him , particularly in thinking of this place , because if he does n't , we risk seeing a house of commons which is stuffed full of low-achievers who hate enterprise , hate people who look after their own family and know absolutely nothing about the outside world .", 
                "cameron said he did not want to discourage people with a successful careers from becoming mps .", 
                "update : duncan has just issued a clarification on twitter .", 
                "alan duncan ( @ alanduncanmp ) seems i could have been a little clearer in parliament today .", 
                "success is of course not always the same as wealth ( 1/2 ) alan duncan ( @ alanduncanmp ) my point was that we should n't discourage people who 've done well in business from entering parliament by sniping at wealth per se ( 2/2 ) cameron effectively withdrew his criticism of the comedian jimmy carr over his involvement with a tax avoidance scheme .", 
                "four years ago cameron said what carr was doing was morally wrong '' .", 
                "today he said : what i 've said before , and i 'm very happy to say again , is there are some practices of very aggressive tax avoidance that i think do merit proper questions and then legislative action .", 
                "and to be fair to jimmy carr , as soon as it was pointed out that he was in a scheme to artificially reduce his income he immediately changed his arrangements .", 
                "he made that very clear and i pay tribute to him for doing that .",
