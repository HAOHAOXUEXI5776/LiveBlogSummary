                "here is a summary .", 
                "some 48 labour mps defied the party whip and opposed the welfare bill at its second reading .", 
                "labour sources consoled themselves by saying that the rebellion was in line with expectations , and no bigger than some other rebellions that took place during ed miliband 's leadership , but the rebellion is a snub to harriet harman , who argued that it was important for the party to abstain on the bill as a whole to show that it understood public concerns about the high cost of welfare spending .", 
                "some 47 labour mps actually voted against the bill , and a 48th acted as a teller for the noes .", 
                "andy burnham , the favourite in the labour leadership contest , has said the party will vote against the bill at its third reading if he becomes labour leader and if the government does not make major changes '' to the bill .", 
                "he made this point in a letter to mps , and he has just posted something very similar on facebook .", 
                "the snp have claimed that tonight 's vote shows that they are the real and effective opposition to the tory government '' .", 
                "overall , it has been a terrific night for the tories , and for george osborne in particular .", 
                "the chancellor did some choice stirring this morning , using a guardian article to urge labour mps to vote with the government , and if that was intended to embolden labour rebels , it probably worked .", 
                "labour are entitled to say that the party has had bigger rebellions before .", 
                "but harrriet harman wanted to use a labour abstention to show that the party was changing its stance on welfare , but instead her tactic backfired , because all the focus tonight has been on the labour split .", 
                "if she had committed labour to voting against the bill from the start , this would have been less of an issue .", 
                "burnham has not had a great night either .", 
                "although he claims some credit for persuading harman to table an amendment saying the bill should not be getting a second reading , he ended up , confusingly , saying that he was both abstaining on the bill ( see 4.02pm - because he was abstaining on the main vote ) and voting against it ( see 9.55pm - because he was voting for the amendment , which said the bill should not get a second reading . )", 
                "yvette cooper , his main rival , also voted the same way , but she did not set herself up as a major opponent of the bill , and is less open to the charge of swithering .", 
                "given the size of the labour rebellion , and given what burnham has been saying about the need for major changes '' to the bill , it seems quite likely that , by the time mps get to vote on the bill 's third reading , the labour leader will be either burnham or cooper and the party as a whole will be voting against the bill ( because the new leader will not want another split ) .", 
                "no doubt that would please osborne too .", 
                "that 's all from me .", 
                "thanks for the comments ."

                "my colleague patrick butler has filed a story today on new research from shelter showing that unemployed families will not be able to afford to live in large parts of england under the new , lower benefit cap in the welfare bill being debated tonight.he explains more here : the popularity of the principle of the benefit cap is well-known ; what is less commonly acknowledged is that the dire impacts of the benefit cap - homelessness , hunger , poverty , children forced to move school - make voters a lot less comfortable .", 
                "today 's analysis by shelter - mapping the uk to show exactly which areas will become no-go areas for jobless families reliant on housing benefit when the cap is lowered to \u00a3 20,000 ( \u00a3 23k in london ) - is designed to remind voters - and mps voting this evening - that the cap has consequences .", 
                "in particular , the maps show how the lower cap has widened the focus of the policy from large families in expensive high rent areas of central london to include smaller families in supposedly cheaper rent areas of the country such as portsmouth , coventry and luton .", 
                "in places like bristol , for example , it shows that private sector rents are so high - and the cap so tight - that an ordinary two parent , two-child family on benefits can not afford to live anywhere in the city - not even overcrowding into a single bed apartment .", 
                "campaigners suspect that the geographical expansion of the cap may surprise people who thought the point of welfare reform was to stop the state spending thousands in housing benefit on large families in kensington and chelsea - not to make small households in two bed flats in cheap areas of peterborough unable to feed their kids .", 
                "as one charity campaigner told me : in its first iteration the cap did n't really affect that many people .", 
                "now someone who is a single mum in low-rent area [ of provincial england ] may be very surprised to find that they are themselves a 'benefit excess story ' '' .", 
                "to date , the cap has been limited in its effects .", 
                "only around 59,000 households in england were hit by the \u00a3 26,000 cap in the whole of its first two years .", 
                "half of these were in london , meaning that - unlike the bedroom tax - most of the country knew nothing of the effects of what was in theory a national policy .", 
                "charities believe that the expansion of the policy - around 110,000 households will be affected if it comes in next april - and its effects on homelessness and poverty - may start to raise the cap 's profile , bedroom tax-style - and change public attitudes ."
