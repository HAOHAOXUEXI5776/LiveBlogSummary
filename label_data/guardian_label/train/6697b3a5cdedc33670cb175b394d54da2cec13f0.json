                "early friday morning local time from warships in the eastern mediterranean , the united states launched 59 tomahawk missiles at a syrian government airfield near homs , in retaliation for a syrian chemical weapons attack earlier this week that killed dozens of civilians , including children .", 
                "the missiles were the first direct attack against president bashar al-assad over six years of syria 's civil war , after years warnings over humanitarian abuses , including bombing hospitals and the use of the sarin nerve agent and chlorine gas .", 
                "donald trump ordered the attacks on thursday afternoon , en route to a south florida summit with the chinese president , xi jinping .", 
                "the strikes took place at about 7.40pm local time while the presidents had dinner .", 
                "afterward trump told the american people it is in their vital national security interest to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons .", 
                "the pentagon alerted russian military counterparts to minimize the risk of conflict .", 
                "a spokesman said the strike appeared to have severely damaged or destroyed syrian aircraft and reduced their ability to use chemical weapons .", 
                "russian authorities disputed the claim , saying many missiles missed their targets .", 
                "by friday afternoon the base was already launching flights again , according to afp .", 
                "the american ambassador to the un , nikki haley , said the us took a very measured step but we are prepared to do more , should assad use chemical weapons again .", 
                "she added that iran and russia bore heavy responsibility for the chemical attack , either by allowing assad to use such weapons or incompetent oversight of their ally 's obligations .", 
                "the world is waiting for russia to reconsider its misplaced alliance with bashar al-assad , she said .", 
                "the united states will no longer wait .", 
                "a spokesman for vladimir putin said the us had violated international law under a false pretext , and un deputy ambassador , vladimir safronkov , warned extremely serious consequences could follow the strike .", 
                "the prime minister , dmitry medvedev , said the action was unjustified and completely ruined relations .", 
                "russia 's military announced it would bolster assad 's air defenses , but it was not clear whether it would cut off the deconfliction hotline it uses to avoid clashes between us and russian forces .", 
                "assad 's office said the strike was foolish and irresponsible and promised to redouble its efforts against rebels .", 
                "his ambassador to the un , bashar jaafari , claimed on friday that a number of martyrs , including women and children were killed by the attack .", 
                "an unnamed syrian official told the ap that at least seven people were killed and nine wounded .", 
                "jaafari also claimed that the syrian government had no chemical weapons .",

                "hitting one airbase is not enough there are 26 airbases that target civilians , a key figure in the army of islam faction , mohamed alloush , said on twitter .", 
                "the whole world should save the syrian people from the clutches of the killer bashar and his aides .", 
                "the us secretary of state , rex tillerson , said the strikes did not indicate a shift in us policy toward syria , even though a few days earlier american diplomats had said assad 's ouster was no longer a priority .", 
                "the white house press secretary , sean s said the strikes had a limited intent to deter chemical weapons and were of a piece with trump 's so-called america first policy .", 
                "the uk , australia , israel and saudi arabia were among the us allies that voiced support for the strikes , while italy and japan said they understood the action .", 
                "the un coordinator for humanitarian affairs , jens laerke , says it had no sign that us military strikes against the syrian airbase had had any direct consequence on overall aid operations in syria .",
