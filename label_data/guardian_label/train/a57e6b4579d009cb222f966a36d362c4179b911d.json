                "but , as we heard this morning with her response to host gary robertson 's interruptions , or yesterday afternoon with eddie mair 's forensic questioning over un-met nhs targets , she can also become irritated and snappy .", 
                "this may relate to the fact that a lot of these interviews have taken her over very familiar , and thus safe , ground on post-election cooperation with other parties , another independence referendum , and so forth .", 
                "a second and related point : when sturgeon is questioned on territory she feels less secure on , like the economy , a 'blinding with science ' mode is employed , again as we heard this morning .", 
                "robertson rightly asked her about the ifs projections which hole beneath the waterline the snp 's plans for full fiscal responsibility and likewise suggest that the snp 's spending plans would lead to deeper cuts than under labour .", 
                "nicola sturgeon being interviewed by evan davis last night sturgeon first went into detail about why the ifs figures on labour were wrong , and then she came to the point that the snp insisted that they did n't include any revenue from planned changes to tax avoidance which would raise \u00a3 7bn and had also underestimated the party 's borrowing plans .", 
                "the trouble with this kind of interview format is that there 's only a short space of time to cover this ground - come back to sturgeon to ask exactly how that \u00a3 7bn is calculated or what the difference between 1.45 and 1.6 % borrowing really amounts to and the audience at home has gone off to take the kids to school .", 
                "but it also means that sturgeon can quotes these figures with impunity .", 
                "a third point relates mainly to this morning 's interview , but also questions from eddie mair yesterday about precisely how progressive the snp actually is .", 
                "robertson asked sturgeon about labour 's proposed changes to stamp duty - she said that the snp 's land and buildings transaction tax ( the first tax to be raised in scotland for 300 years and a supposedly progressive alternative to stamp duty ) has already exempted 50 % of scottish homeowners .", 
                "she added that this was not a case of following labour , but labour following the snp .",
