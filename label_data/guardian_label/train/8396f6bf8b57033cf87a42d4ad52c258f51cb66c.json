                "that was the third labour leadership hustings in three days .", 
                "one was behind closed doors ( to the parliamentary labour party ) , but i watched saturday 's and today 's .", 
                "the contours of the race are getting clearer .", 
                "there are three frontrunners : andy burnham , the favourite ; yvette cooper , who , like like burnham , is in the continuity/experience tradition ; and liz kendall , the blairite/change/middle england candidate .", 
                "then there is mary creagh , who , like kendall , is a pro-business fresh face , and jeremy corbyn , the leftwinger , but both of those two may have difficulty getting enough nominations to make it onto the ballot paper .", 
                "on saturday the key arguments were between burnham/cooper on the one hand , and kendall on the other .", 
                "creagh did not say anything particularly distinctive , and corbyn , although popular with guardian readers , looked like someone going through the motions , rather than launching a serious bid to become the next labour leader .", 
                "today corbyn still sounded like the token leftwinger .", 
                "but the dynamic between kendall and creagh shifted a little .", 
                "kendall ( who at one point prompted mild booing on saturday ) seems to have softened some of her provocative blairite rhetoric a little , and on europe she has shifted closer to burnham .", 
                "( see below . )", 
                "and creagh has struck out .", 
                "she made a mark today by being the only person to say she would share a platform with david cameron in the pro-eu campaign .", 
                "that might not be enough to get her on the ballot paper , but now she can claim to be the most pro-eu voice in the field .", 
                "earlier i quoted harry cole saying it was a bad day for andy burnham .", 
                "( see 4.37pm . )", 
                "actually , i disagree and , although it is hard to tell watching on a video feed from across the irish sea , my impression was that he came over as well as any of the candidates .", 
                "true , there was some jeering at some point when he refused to answer a yes/no question , but it sounded more jocular than hostile and many observers would take the view that refusing to respond to complicated policy questions in simple yes/no terms is perfectly reasonable .", 
                "in policy terms it is hard to differentiate between cooper and burnham .", 
                "but , in communication terms , he is ahead of her ( and the others ) because he exudes more passion and charisma .", 
                "that came out at several points today when he was able to engage emotionally with the audience better than his rivals ; for example , in his closing statement .", 
                "i went from a merseyside comprehensive to cambridge and then to the cabinet , but i 've never forgotten who i am or where i come from .", 
                "in 2009 i went to anfield as a representative of the last labour government .", 
                "for 20 years a whole city , our city , my city , had been crying injustice , but labour was n't listening , and rightly i felt the force of their anger that day .", 
                "but moments like that make you who you are .", 
                "i took that message back to the cabinet table and i took on the establishment .", 
                "and i hope that will tell you everything you need to know about me .", 
                "here are the key news points .", 
                "burnham said that labour 's manifesto in 2015 was the best the party has had in the last four elections .", 
                "he said : i would say that it is the best manifesto that i have stood on in the four general elections i 've stood for parliament for labour .", 
                "and i says that and pay tribute and give credit to ed miliband .", 
                "i believe he did something important in re-focusing our party on inequality and in putting his finger on the growing casualisation of work , and the damage that does , the insecurity that comes from that , the damage to people 's health and well-being .", 
                "this came when the candidates were asked if the manifesto was too leftwing .", 
                "they all rejected this idea , but burnham was the only candidate to speak up for it enthusiastically , and his comments were striking in the light of the extent to which labour frontbenchers have been disowning large chunks of the manifesto since 7 may .", 
                "burnham was jeered by the audience for failing to give a direct answer when they were asked if they supported lowering the benefits cap from \u00e2\u00a3 26,000 to \u00e2\u00a3 23,000 .", 
                "burnham said that he was not opposed to the principle of a cap but when the mirror journalist kevin maguire , who was chairing the event , repeatedly demanded a straight yes/no answer to the question of whether he favoured a \u00e2\u00a3 23,000 cap , and burnham refused to answer in those terms , members of their audience expressed their anger .", 
                "burnham insisted that it was a complicated issue , and that it depended on what other changes were introduced alongside the cap .", 
                "cooper also refused to give a simple yes/no answer , prompting some audience complaints .", 
                "she said the current policy was unfair .", 
                "corbyn said he would not back the \u00e2\u00a3 23,000 cap , but creagh and kendall both said they were in favour of it .", 
                "creagh became the only candidate to say that she would share a platform with david cameron in a pro-eu campaign .", 
                "she said : yes .", 
                "it 's in britain 's interests .", 
                "we should do the right thing .", 
                "all the other candidates ruled out sharing a platform with cameron .", 
                "at the labour hustings on saturday how labour would campaign in the eu referendum provided a dividing line between kendall and burnham , with kendall saying it would be a profound mistake for labour to boycott the cross-party pro-eu campaign , and burnham saying labour should run its own campaign .", 
                "today kendall was much closer to burnham 's position on this .", 
                "she said she would not share a platform with the prime minister , and she stressed the need for labour to run a strong campaign on europe .", 
                "kendall said labour was under mortal threat .", 
                "in her opening statement she said : we are here at a moment when the labour party , the party formed to represent organised labour , is under mortal threat .", 
                "the scale of our defeat at the election , and the threats we face in future , leave me in no doubt we must change or face irrelevance .", 
                "the candidates have shown they are split over fracking .", 
                "on saturday burnham said that he favoured a moratorium on fracking and he repeated that call today .", 
                "he was backed by corbyn , who said he was opposed to fracking because of the pollution it caused .", 
                "but kendall and creagh both signalled that they were in favour of fracking .", 
                "cooper also said it would be a mistake to rule it out , but she sounded marginally more cautious about it than kendall and creagh .", 
                "burnham strongly defended trade unions and said the labour leadership had not spoken up for them enough in the past .", 
                "it [ union money ] is the cleanest money in politics to organise the donations of ordinary working people , then to fund political parties .", 
                "and to give those people a voice in politics .", 
                "i 'm sorry to say that you have not had labour politicians on the national stage saying that enough in recent years .", 
                "my whole family , my whole background , is in the trade union movement .", 
                "as your leader , that is precisely what i will do because trade unions boost participation in democracy , in politics , they support people at risk of exploitation , they help build civil society .", 
                "he said he wanted to take labour out of the westminster bubble .", 
                "the painful truth is this .", 
                "labour has lost its emotional contact with millions of people they look at us and they do n't see people they can relate to , who speak their language .", 
                "they see a westminster elite talking in a political code .", 
                "well , this is the big change that i 'm going to make as the leader of the labour party .", 
                "i will take labout out of the westminster bubble .", 
                "i will be a leader who people can relate to , whose voice will be able to carry into all the nations and regions of our country .",
