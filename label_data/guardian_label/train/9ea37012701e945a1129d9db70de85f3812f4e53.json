                "whilst i did not support you for the leadership election , i recognised the significant mandate you had won from all sections of the party and was of course proud to be a member of a shadow cabinet that - for the first time ever - had a majority of women .", 
                "i also have huge respect for you personally as someone who has stood by their principles over many years and done so with decency and respect for those with whom you did not agree .", 
                "i therefore thank you for giving me the opportunity to be part of your team .", 
                "since my election as the mp for newcastle north in 2010 , i have worked hard to represent my constituents both in newcastle and in westminster whilst juggling the demands of having young children and living in two different places .", 
                "i am the first to recognise that many parents and carers up and down the country are also balancing work with family life , however , there are three reasons why this situation has become more difficult for me since returning to parliament after the election in may .", 
                "as you know , i had my third child twelve months ago and have spend this past year combining care for him with both a general election campaign and then returning to parliament , including taking on the additional responsibility of a shadow cabinet post .", 
                "the logistics of managing family life in newcastle with my work down in westminster have inevitably become more of a challenge .", 
                "the second is the reality of being a shadow cabinet member .", 
                "whilst this is of course a huge honour and privilege , it is perhaps not generally understood that this precludes an mp from speaking up in parliament on issues outside their brief .", 
                "whilst i have been able to use my position to raise concerns about issues such as corporate criminal liability , serious economic crime , prosecution rates , legal aid , and access to justice , i have found it increasingly difficult not to be able to speak up in the commons about other matters that are of huge importance to my constituents in newcastle north .", 
                "both of these issues are amplified by a third factor - the situation in which the labour party now finds itself .", 
                "as somebody who came into politics with the sole motivation of making life better for my city , my region and , by extension , the country as a whole , i recognised that our electoral defeats in both 2010 and 2015 demanded a genuine and profound response from the labour party .", 
                "i therefore shared your optimism for the 'new kind of politics ' you spoke so compellingly about .",

                "i will post a round-up shortly .", 
                "but first here are the main news points corbyn refused to rule out authorising drone strikes to kill jihadis .", 
                "he sounded quite sceptical ( no one will have come away from the interview feeling that he was itching to pull the trigger ) , but he did sound notably more open to the idea of authorising a strike like the one that killed the britons in august than he has in previous interviews when he has questioned the whole legality of attacks like this .", 
                "this is what he said when asked if he would authorise a drone strike to kill the jihadi in the recent islamic state video showing five hostages being killed .", 
                "i think that 's a hypothetical question .", 
                "you have to look at the sources of the support of isil , you have to look at the way it gets its money , the way it gets its weapons .", 
                "when pressed on this , he went on : i would want to know what the evidence is , what difference it would make by doing that , what the chances were of capturing somebody - i suspect probably very , very low in those circumstances - so action could be taken .", 
                "he said he had still not decided whether labour 's new policy on trident will be decided by a ballot of all party members .", 
                "such a move would bypass the party 's established policy making procedure , which involves the national policy forum drawing up policy and it being confirmed at party conference ( where trade unions , many of which favour trident , have 50 % of the vote ) .", 
                "last week john mcdonnell , the shadow chancellor and a key corbyn ally , suggested party members would take the decision in a ballot .", 
                "corbyn said this was still unresolved .", 
                "he said he wanted members to have a big say '' but that the details were not finalised .", 
                "i want members to have a big say in it .", 
                "whether that comes as a vote of individual members , or a vote at conference , that will be decided .", 
                "i have not made up my mind on that .", 
                "but he suggested he was leaning towards a new procedure .", 
                "my whole election programme was based on the need for ordinary people to be able to participate much more in politics , so that leaders do n't go away and write policy , so that executive groups do n't go off and decide what the policy is , ordinary people do .", 
                "he said labour 's new policy on trident should have supporting the nuclear non-proliferation treaty at its heart .", 
                "it has to start from the basis that we are signed up to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , itself a creation of the 1960s labour government of harold wilson , and that there also has to be a policy of what we do to ensure protection of skills and jobs throughout british industry that are in some part reliant on the whole trident nuclear programme .", 
                "but if we want to live in a nuclear-free world , we have to recognise that we have to make a contribution to it .", 
                "renewing trident , in my view , goes against the fundamental spirit of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty which requires the five declared nuclear weapons states not to renew their weapons systems .", 
                "he said he supported the anti-trident rally being planned for february and did not rule out speaking at it .", 
                "corbyn said that he was not in favour of terrorism of any sort '' and that he did not believe the french government was responsible for the attacks on paris .", 
                "i am absolutely not in favour of terrorism of any sort .", 
                "it is absolutely appalling and disgraceful that civilian life should be taken by random acts of terrorism as happened in paris of course the french government were not responsible for the attacks on the streets of paris any more than any other government was from the west .", 
                "but i would just say , listen very carefully to the analysis that president obama gave of the situation in the middle east when he said we have to think long and hard about the longer-term effects of both the war in afghanistan and the war in iraq , about what that does .", 
                "we have a terrible situation in syria , we have a terrible situation developing in iraq and now sadly getting even worse in afghanistan .", 
                "can we not think very long and hard about what our long-term policies and objectives have to be .", 
                "corbyn said he agreed with what pat mcfadden said about terrorists being responsible for their behaviour .", 
                "but he also said he thought mcfadden 's comments on this in the commons were distorting what corbyn thought .", 
                "he said mcfadden was sacked as shadow europe minister not just because of that , but because of various critical things he had said .", 
                "corbyn said he opposed saddam hussein long before many of those who supported the iraq war .", 
                "i was probably opposed to saddam hussein long before all those people who supported the war decided they were opposed to him .", 
                "he praised hilary benn , the shadow foreign secretary , for his brilliant '' performance attacking the government over its relationship with saudi arabia .", 
                "he said he had had very long discussions with benn during the reshuffle last week during which benn kept his post , but he would not go into details .", 
                "he said british foreign policy should be based on human rights .", 
                "we has a country have got to develop a human rights-based foreign policy .", 
                "he claimed he did not know who briefed journalists that he intended to move benn .", 
                "i 'm not sure where the briefing came from , '' he said .", 
                "corbyn claimed the reshuffle had made his frontbench team more representative of the country and of the parliamentary labour party .", 
                "he particularly highlighted two junior appointments as important : emma lewell-buck taking responsibility for campaigning in the north ; and kate osamor taking on equalities role he said he supported junior doctors ' strike .", 
                "we should recognise that junior doctors are qualified , extremely hard working , deserve to be treated properly , and jeremy hunt should now come to an agreement with them .", 
                "he brushed aside the claim that he is not capable of winning over voters who do not already agree with him .", 
                "somewhere along the line i 've managed to be reelected eight times in my constituency , with very large majorities .", 
                "i started off with a very small majority .", 
                "i managed to receive the support of 250,000 members and supporters of the party during the leadership election .", 
                "i realise that 's not the public .", 
                "but i just say this .", 
                "if we carry on like this in this county , we end up with a more divided britain , we end up with more people sleeping homeless , we end up with more young people in overcrowded accommodation , underachieving at school .",
