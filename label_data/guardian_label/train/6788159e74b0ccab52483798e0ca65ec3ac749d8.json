                "david cameron will try to brush off embarrassing net migration figures on thursday by announcing details of a new immigration bill to be included in the queen 's speech , which will propose a new criminal offence of illegal working that will allow police to seize the wages of anyone employed unlawfully .", 
                "it has been estimated that the backlog of people in britain who have overstayed their visas and whose whereabouts are unknown is around 300,000 , but it is not known how many are working .", 
                "cameron managed to survive the general election even though he once urged voters to kick him out if he failed to bring net migration down to the tens of thousands .", 
                "the last official quarterly net migration figures showed net migration was 298,000 last year , 54,000 higher than when he made the pledge in 2010 .", 
                "cameron promised in the tory manifesto to keep the pledge , although he has also said he would be adding new metrics to test whether migration was being reduced .", 
                "on the today programme this morning saira grant , legal and policy director of the joint council for the welfare of immigrants ( jcwi ) , said that one proposal , extending the cases in which people are deported before appeal , would be extremely detrimental '' .",

                "it makes a very real practical difference , if i may say so , in terms of acting as a deterrent for people who are trying to be here illegally .", 
                "this is n't about revenue raising .", 
                "it is about making it harder for people to be here illegally and it is about setting a very clear deterrent for people who want to stay here illegally .",
