                "as i said earlier , the key fact from theresa may 's statement was a negative : the absence of any fresh tory row about brexit .", 
                "( see 5.54pm . )", 
                "but there was some news in what may and jeremy corbyn had to say .", 
                "here are the key points .", 
                "may confirmed that the uk 's financial offer to the eu was conditional on the government getting a brexit deal .", 
                "she told mps : it is clear in the joint progress report , i have repeated it in my statement just now , that this offer is on the table in the context of us agreeing the partnership for the future , agreeing the next stage and agreeing the partnership for the future .", 
                "if we do n't agree that partnership , then this offer is off the table .", 
                "but the brexit deal she was talking about was the withdrawal agreement .", 
                "this will refer in general terms to a future trade deal , but it wo n't actually be the trade deal .", 
                "may also also said the uk 's final brexit bill payment would be worth between \u00e2\u00a3 35bn and \u00e2\u00a3 39bn .", 
                "may claimed the government still hoped to agree a trade deal by next autumn .", 
                "asked by the tory mp anna soubry if the agreement on trade next autumn would be details of a new trade relationship , or just heads of agreement , may replied : we have always said that we will be working to negotiate our full agreement in terms of the future relationship that we have with the european union .", 
                "of course , legally it wo n't be possible for them to sign up to that agreement until after we have left the european union and we 've become a third county .", 
                "while we are in the eu , it 's not possible to [ be ] a signatory of that agreement .", 
                "but the pieces of work that will now go forward will be the details of the implementation period , the details of the withdrawal agreement , which will have to go through certain parliamentary processes in european member states and also the future relationship that we will have in trade terms and security terms with the european union .", 
                "but the eu does not expect to agree a proper trade deal by the end of next year .", 
                "it just envisages a political declaration covering trade .", 
                "( see 11.08am . )", 
                "may said the transition deal arrangements may not be agreed until march .", 
                "in response to a question from the tory jeremy lefroy about how long it would take , she said she expected work on the transition to start straight after the eu summit this week .", 
                "she went on : there are some details to be sorted out .", 
                "i think the general expectation is that it will be agreed , we 've said as early as possible in the new year , and michel barnier [ the eu 's chief brexit negotiator ] has indicated that could be during the first quarter .", 
                "she indicated that the government was not dropping the amendment to the eu withdrawal bill fixing 29 march 2019 as brexit day .", 
                "some tories have criticised this on the grounds that it might stop the government seeking an extension if the negotiations over-run , and at one point it looked as if the goverment might drop the amendment , which will be put to a vote next week .", 
                "but today may said : we put that amendment down because we believe it 's important that we actually confirm and people have the confidence of knowing the date on which we will be leaving the european union , which is march 29 2019 .", 
                "she said last week 's deal was good news for people who voted leave and for people who voted remain .", 
                "she said : this is good news for people who voted leave , who were worried we were so bogged down in tortuous negotiations it was never going to happen .", 
                "and it is good news for people who voted remain , who were worried we were going to crash out without a deal .", 
                "she flatly denied a claim from labour 's chuka umunna that civil servants have been told not to write memos about the impact of brexit on sections of the economy .", 
                "umunna said : senior civil servants across whitehall have reportedly been instructed from here on not to commit into writing any evaluation they make of the impact of brexit on their industry sectors .",
