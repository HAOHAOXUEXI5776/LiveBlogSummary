                "michael hewson , chief market analyst at cmc markets uk , said : as we head into the final full trading week of 2016 , having come off a decent december so far for european stocks which have seen a number of significant breakouts , the key question as we head into year-end is whether these gains of the past two weeks are likely to be sustained .", 
                "initial impressions look positive , however the elephant in the room remains the italian banking sector after last week 's announcement by italy 's largest bank unicredit to draw a line under its recent problems by announcing a significant recapitalisation plan .", 
                "this week all eyes will return to monte dei paschi di siena who are expected to launch their plans to sell \u20ac5bn of stock in the days leading up to christmas to institutions and retail investors , in the hope that over \u20ac25bn of bad loans can then be sold on , and the bank rescued without having to bail in retail bondholders .", 
                "while the political at the top of italian government has become a little clearer there is no reason that this particular attempted restructuring package is likely to be any more successful than the previous three , given the continued weakness of the italian economy , which is probably why so far there has been so little investor interest .", 
                "there may also be developments in the greek crisis , after lenders objected to the government 's plans to give christmas bonuses to pensioners ."
