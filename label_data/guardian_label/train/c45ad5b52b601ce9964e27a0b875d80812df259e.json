                "his claim is a historical one , based on much-queried empirical methods , but underwriting his narrative of progress is an assessment of human nature that worries we 'll fall into anarchy without a strong state to guide us .", 
                "is this , rather than the idea that we 're becoming less violent , his really dangerous idea ?", 
                "in light of fresh anxieties about the rise of the security state and mass surveillance , it seems much more dangerous to worry over mass anarchy than the overreach of state power .",

                "i put to pinker the idea that because the state has a monopoly on violence , and wields it in increasingly asymmetrical ways ( drone strikes , militarised police , mass surveillance ) , it 's hard for citizens to respond .", 
                "i do n't think that there 's much merit to those points , pinker said .",

                "but one part of human nature , namely the capacity to think up violence-reduction methods , such as governments and the rule of law , can counteract other parts of human nature such as the drive for dominance and revenge .",

                "in what was one of the more provocative fodi talks today , ekman said this was so a male buyer can remain faithful to his wife , who may be infertile , and so a male homosexual couple may keep their gayness intact while fathering a child .",

                "ekman explained that surrogacy began in the us during the 1970s , after abortion was legalised .", 
                "because there was a marked decline in the number of newborns being put up for adoption , infertile , middle class couples turned to international adoption but many white couples did n't want a baby who looked racially different to them .",
