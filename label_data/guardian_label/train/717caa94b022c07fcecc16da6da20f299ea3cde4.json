            "text": [
                "frank field , the labour chair of the commons work and pensions committee , has been speaking at a resolution foundation event this morning .", 
                "it is the one where the thinktank is presenting new research explaining how the treasury could afford to abandon its plans to cut tax credits .", 
                "in his speech , field said george osborne should use the tax credits debacle as an opportunity for serious tax credits reform .", 
                "here are the key points .", 
                "field criticised the treasury for refusing to release proper information about the impact of the proposed tax credit cuts .", 
                "the treasury appears to be operating a policy of non-cooperation .", 
                "every attempt to gain information , every parliamentary question tabled , is batted back with the same tired old response that the answer could only be gained at 'disproportionate cost ' .", 
                "one example is the numbers of low earners who roll on and off tax credits each year .", 
                "the centre for social justice , who have contributed their own proposals to protect low earners as well as their own welfare reform creation , universal credit , say that by 2020 only 9 per cent of people currently on tax credits will still have a live tax credit claim .", 
                "but the treasury 's policy of non-cooperation means we can not say with any certainty how many of today 's tax credit claimants will either have migrated to universal credit or floated off in-work benefits by earning higher wages .", 
                "he said that osborne should avoid trying to mitigate the impact of the tax credit cuts by increasing the tax allowance or the national insurance threshold .", 
                "the chancellor must resist the urge to shower any new money on the whole working population .", 
                "any moves to increase the personal allowance , or increase the national insurance threshold , whilst welcome in themselves as part of a general budget strategy , would not compensate the 3.2m low earners who stand to lose out from his current tax credit reforms .", 
                "their losses would largely remain undiminished by changing the thresholds .", 
                "the only way the chancellor will be able to protect those children in families who currently stand to lose out is by changing his proposals to reform the tax credit system itself .", 
                "field said that , having been forced to conduct a rethink on tax credits , osborne should take the opportunity to introduce serious tax credits reform '' .", 
                "the unholy tax credit muddle offers the chancellor the possibility of becoming a serious welfare reformer .", 
                "the muddle the chancellor is in results from his starting point of aiming simply to save \u00a3 4.4bn .", 
                "the inability of the chancellor to get his tax credit cuts through the house of lords allows him to ask a different question : 'how do i transform the role of tax credits from one that was a general subsidy to low wages to one that will become a benefit to poorer children , underpinned by a national living wage strategy ? '", 
                "he said osborne should transform tax credits into a benefit intended to help low-paid people for children .", 
                "tax credits for workers without children should be phased out by 2020 , field said , although he said that there might have to be some transitional protection '' after that date for people unable to increase the number of hours they work .", 
                "by 2020 the national living wage '' should be \u00a3 9 an hour , he said , and this should be the key measure helping this group .", 
                "instead tax credits should be focused on those with children , he said .", 
                "this move is no silver bullet , but it would kick-start a wider reform programme by bringing tax credits back to their original conception .", 
                "this was to ensure that the money earned by individuals with children , together with child benefit and the tax credits , would afford them a higher standard of living than the childless , and those out of work and dependent on benefits .", 
                "he said that jobcentre staff should actively help claimants focus on increasing their earnings .", 
                "and , to give them an incentive , people should be able to increase their earnings by up to \u00a3 5,000 over 18 months without losing tax credit , he said .", 
                "both for the childless , and for tax credit claimants with children , the department for work and pensions should build up the capacity to offer tax credit claimants the first of what might become a whole series of job coaching support exercises .", 
                "claimants enrolling on this pay progression scheme would be invited into jobcentre plus to discuss how they might increase their earnings over the next few years .", 
                "it would be in the interest of all claimants to engage fully and therefore the interviews need not be made mandatory .", 
                "at these interviews jobcentre plus staff should offer a package of support so that individuals can begin to transform what they earn .", 
                "for some this may be difficult at the current time , and for others it may be impossible , but all working tax credit recipients should be offered the same deal .", 
                "the aim would be for jobcentre plus staff to work with claimants to find new job opportunities paying higher wages , or to negotiate with existing employers to be able to work longer hours in the same firm .", 
                "the incentives should be clear ; raising claimants ' pay by up to \u00a3 5,000 within any 18 month period should be free of any loss in tax credit entitlements .", 
                "the chancellor should therefore extend the time over which this 'income disregard ' would count and reverse the decision to halve this disregard to \u00a3 2,500 .",
