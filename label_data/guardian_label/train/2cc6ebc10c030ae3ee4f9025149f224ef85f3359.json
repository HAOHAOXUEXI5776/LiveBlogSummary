                "sentencing will take place on 6 july judge thokozile masipa said the court would reconvene on wednesday 6 july for her to hand down sentence .", 
                "masipa also allowed an application by chief prosecutor gerrie nel , backed by the steenkamp family , to publish photos of reeva steenkamp 's injuries .", 
                "nel : is n't it time we now finally let the world see what this accused did with four black talon rounds through a door ?", 
                "defence : 'no purpose served ' in sending pistorius to prison in a moment of high drama , and with many people in court in tears , oscar pistorius took off his prostheses and walked across the room , grabbing a desk for support .", 
                "defence counsel barry roux told the judge : i do n't want to overplay vulnerability i do n't want to overplay disability it does n't mean because he 's vulnerable that he can do what he likes .", 
                "that 's not what we say .", 
                "but when we 're entering the field of sentencing , look at that man 's conduct please let 's understand who is this man that you must sentence ?", 
                "oscar pistorius demonstrates walking without his prosthetic legs in court there is no purpose served '' by sending pistorius back to prison , roux argued , and he should instead perform community service : punishment is not meant to break the defendant the accused does not fall into the category of offender who should be removed from society .", 
                "roux said there were serious enemies '' in the case , including the widely-held perception that pistorius had intended to kill steenkamp , and the unwillingness of many people to take into account the circumstances : it was not the man winning gold medals that must be judged it was a 1.5-metre person , standing on his stumps , three o'clock in the morning when it was dark .", 
                "the defence cited the case of rugby player vleis visagie , who accidentally killed his daughter and was not prosecuted : how must you feel when you fire those shots that you should not have , and it 's your own girlfriend ?", 
                "the facts of the case were not set aside by the supreme court , which upgraded the conviction to murder on a legal point , roux said .", 
                "the original five-year sentence relied on those same facts : he was anxious , vulnerable and afraid ; he did not intend to kill steenkamp .", 
                "the decision to broadcast the trial had not benefitted pistorius , roux said : no other accused has ever had to endure this level of publicity , misinformation and character assassination .", 
                "state : '15 years in prison is the minimum ' gerrie nel , for the state , said the judge had no choice under the law but to start with a minimum sentence of 15 years in prison .", 
                "it was not plausible to argue that pistorius was remorseful when he still has no acceptable explanation '' for why he acted as he did , nel said .", 
                "nel said that while the defence talked about pistorius ' suffering , reeva steenkamp disappeared '' .", 
                "she is just as important as the personal circumstances of the accused she can never walk in court .", 
                "nel said the broken man '' in the courtroom was not pistorius but barry steenkamp , reeva 's father , and that his decision to forgive his daughter 's killer was not a reason for leniency : forgiveness has more to do with the person forgiving than with the crime .", 
                "barry steenkamp looks across to oscar pistorius in the dock .", 
                "skuy/ap nel said it was disrespectful to the court , to the victims of this crime , to the deceased '' that pistorius had chosen to give an interview to itv , to be broadcast next week .",

                "she said her family would not get over the killing , and said pistorius ' decision to give an interview to britain 's itv channel was hurtful '' : people say we got the truth , but we did n't .", 
                "oscar 's version changed so many times he never apologised for shooting reeva .",
