                "dozens of protesters staged a sit-in at florida senator marco rubio 's orlando office on monday , demanding action on stricter gun laws and policies to protect lgbt individuals .", 
                "marco rubio /rex/shutterstock the demonstration comes nearly one month after a gay nightclub in the city was the target of the deadliest mass shooting in us history , with 49 people killed and 53 more injured .", 
                "the organizers said the sit-in would continue for 49 hours , one for each of the slain victims in the 12 june massacre .", 
                "it was after the pulse nightclub shooting that rubio , whose presidential campaign ended in march , first signaled he might reconsider his decision not to seek re-election to the senate .", 
                "the senator , who formally entered the race last month , has since drawn criticism from proponents of gun safety reforms and lgbt rights for his record on both issues .", 
                "rubio remains opposed to marriage equality and has voted against measures in the past that would protect lgbt individuals from workplace discrimination .", 
                "the senator is also a staunch supporter of the second amendment and last week celebrated an endorsement from the national rifle association toward his re-election campaign .", 
                "rubio has routinely argued that new gun laws would do little to prevent america 's gun violence epidemic and voted against bills to expand background checks and bar those on the fbi 's terror watch list from purchasing firearms .", 
                "the orlando gunman , omar mateen , was not actively on a watch list but deemed self-radicalized by authorities and investigated by the fbi several years prior .", 
                "in the wake of the orlando attack , rubio voted for republican-backed alternatives to delay firearm sales to those on the terror watch list and require the justice department to prove within 72 hours that there was probable cause to ban the purchase all together .", 
                "senator rubio respects the views of others on these difficult issues , and he welcomes the continued input he is receiving from people across the political spectrum , alex burgos , a spokesman for his senate office , said in a statement on the protest .", 
                "senator rubio and our office continue working around the clock on federal casework to assist victims ' families , survivors and their families , and we stand ready to continue assisting , including lending staff to the victim assistance center as we did for the last few weeks .", 
                "over the past month , senator rubio has supported common sense compromises to make it easier to track individuals who have been on the terror watch list and later try to buy firearms , all while improving due process protections for law abiding americans , he added .", 
                "protestors argued that rubio 's steps were insufficient and vowed to press on even as police indicated they might face arrest if they refused to leave the building upon its closure .", 
                "their demonstration was reminiscent of a sit-in organized by house democrats last month , in which lawmakers occupied the floor of the chamber for 26 hours in the pursuit of a vote on tougher gun restrictions .", 
                "the sit-in at rubio 's office began at roughly 10 a.m. and has been dubbed as # sitinforthe49 on social media .", 
                "in addition to lgbt rights and gun control , protesters also cited police brutality as a prime area of concern .", 
                "photos and videos from the event showed demonstrators singing we shall overcome and reading the names of the orlando victims , whose names they also printed out and placed on the office floor along with red roses .", 
                "patrick murphy , the florida congressman who is likely to be rubio 's democratic opponent in the senate race , threw his support behind the effort .", 
                "this kind of brave demonstration should inspire us all to pass meaningful legislation to prevent future tragedies , murphy said in a statement .", 
                "unfortunately , marco rubio has doubled down on his opposition to commonsense gun violence prevention efforts and has yet to acknowledge that this was a hate crime against the lgbt community .", 
                "it 's clear that floridians have had enough of marco rubio putting his political ambition above the people he is supposed to represent ."
