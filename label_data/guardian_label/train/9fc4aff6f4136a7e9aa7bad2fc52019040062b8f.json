            "text": [
                "lord bridges of headley is not exactly a household name - he 's an old etonian former conservative party official ennobled by david cameron - but he was a brexit minister until june when , after the general election , he resigned without saying why .", 
                "bridges voted remain , and according to one report ( paywall ) he left because he was convinced brexit could n't work .", 
                "but he did not say so himself .", 
                "now he has spoken out , in a speech in the house of lords last night .", 
                "it was his first speech in the chamber since his resignation and , although he was not overtly critical of the government 's stance , you do n't have to be a cryptologist to work out that he thinks theresa may and her team are not handling brexit well .", 
                "ministers are not being honest about the challenges brexit poses , he suggested .", 
                "he told peers : first , an observation : faced with any challenge , one must acknowledge the truth .", 
                "if we are not honest with ourselves , our plans will be built on sand .", 
                "consequently , we will lose the trust of those who look to us for leadership , and those with whom we are negotiating .", 
                "we must be honest about the task we faceits complexity and scale .", 
                "we must be honest about the need to compromise and about the lack of time that we , and europe , have to come to an agreement on our withdrawal .", 
                "bridges stressed the need for a transition , which he suggested should run until the end of 2020 , and he said the uk should continue to pay into the eu budget during this period .", 
                "we should make it clear that we are willing to continue to contribute to the eu budget as we cross the bridgein other words , between march 2019 and the end of 2020 .", 
                "that would help us to address the eu 's concern that our withdrawal blows a hole in its budget .", 
                "we would be honouring commitments we have made for the rest of the eu 's budgetary period ; the eu would then need to justify why we must contribute more than that .", 
                "and he was gently scathing about may 's expressed wish for her government to be defined by something more than brexit .", 
                "he said : the challenge of creating a new partnership touches on every aspect of our lives , as we have been discussing .", 
                "it is a gargantuan task ; so , let us be honest about this too .", 
                "i hear the government talk of not wishing to be defined by brexit .", 
                "brexit is the biggest change this nation has faced since 1945 .", 
                "to say we do not wish to be defined by brexit is like winston churchill saying in 1940 that he did not want his government to be defined by the war .", 
                "such careless talk costs time , as it allows the machinery of government to be distracted from the task at hand .", 
                "as usual , i expect there will be a lot more brexit here before the day is over .", 
                "here is the agenda for the day .",

                "politico europe is covering it on a live blog .", 
                "according to sky 's faisal islam , brexit does not seem to feature .", 
                "faisal islam ( @ faisalislam ) no mention of brexit from juncker , which might appear odd in a speech about the `` state of the eu '' now speeding up trade talks with oz/nz 9am : chris grayling , the transport secretary , gives a speech to a rail summit .",

                "they will vote at around 4pm .", 
                "later there will be a debate on a labour motion saying the government 's latest rise in university tuition fees should be scrapped .", 
                "as usual , i will be covering breaking political news as it happens , as well as bringing you the best reaction , comment and analysis from the web .", 
                "i plan to post a summary after pmqs and another in the afternoon .",
