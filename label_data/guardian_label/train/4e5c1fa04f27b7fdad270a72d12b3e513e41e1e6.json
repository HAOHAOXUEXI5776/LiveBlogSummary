                "the lib dem leader always struggles to get much of a hearing in british politics .", 
                "it gets harder when you have just 12 mps .", 
                "and if your conference speech coincides with boris johnson coming close to the brink of resignation , and president trump talking about totally destroying north korea , you 're not going to grab the headlines .", 
                "even with an empty news schedule , sir vince cable 's first speech would not have made it to the top of the bulletins .", 
                "it contained no significant , newsy announcements , no great personal revelations or stylistic surprises and it did not point the liberal democrats in a fresh direction .", 
                "but a no-news speech is n't necessarily a bad speech .", 
                "there was an inherent seriousness about this that was gratifying , and it was refreshingly free of the slogany guff that usually pollutes party leaders ' speeches .", 
                "if you are at all interested in the lib dems , or centre ground politics , it is worth a read .", 
                "here are the main points .", 
                "cable said he did not want the lib dems to be seen as a single issue party .", 
                "although he devoted a large part of his speech to brexit , and to the lib dems ' determination to be seen as the party of remain '' , he also spoke at length about domestic policy and said that he did not want the lib dems to be defined purely through the prism of europe .", 
                "we are not a single-issue party we 're not ukip in reverse .", 
                "he insisted that the lib dems could form a government and that he could prime minister .", 
                "he first raised this about half way through the speech , saying : our party is not just a coalition partner of the past , we are the government of the future .", 
                "and my role , as your leader , is to be a credible potential prime minister .", 
                "and he finished his speech by saying : i am ready to take our message out to the country , and i ask you to join me on the journey as we , together , take the liberal democrats back to government .", 
                "cable also pointed out that his shadow cabinet contained 10 former ministers , including three former cabinet ministers .", 
                "by contrast , there were only two people who have been anywhere near cabinet '' in jeremy corbyn 's shadow ministerial team , he claimed .", 
                "when it was put to lib dem aides that the idea of cable forming a government after the last election seemed wholly unrealistic , one said that politics has speeded up '' recently and that at one point the idea of emmanuel macron becoming french president would have been equally improbable .", 
                "another said : you can scoff and say it is unlikely .", 
                "but some pretty unlikely things have happened .", 
                "and this [ cable ] is a guy who has a track record of doing some unlikely things .", 
                "he said that he was appointing the former lib dem mp david howarth to look at the case for replacing tuition fees with a graduate tax .", 
                "he suggested that the problem for the lib dems with the coalition 's decision to raise tuition fees to \u00a3 9,000 was not so much the policy as the fact that it broke a pre-election promise .", 
                "( see 3.32pm . )", 
                "he said the current tuition fee policy already operates like a tax .", 
                "but it was not seen as one , he said .", 
                "yet just because the system operates like a tax , we can not escape the fact it is n't seen as one the worry about debt does cause students and their families real concern .", 
                "escalating student loan interest rates add to that concern .", 
                "and many universities are obsessed with getting bums on seats rather than giving students value for money .", 
                "he floated the idea of giving all young people a learning account to pay for university or training .", 
                "this could be funded by higher wealth taxes , he suggested .", 
                "one idea i want to develop with you - with the party - is finding a way to support all young people in future with an endowment or learning account , which they can use at any stage in life , helping to finance further or higher education , either at the post-18 stage or later in life .", 
                "it is a fundamentally liberal idea , handing control to the individual , and i want to explore how it can be sustainably financed through fair taxation of wealth .", 
                "cable did not elaborate on how this might be funded by fair taxation of wealth '' , but he did explore the idea in more detail in a recent speech to the resolution foundation on inequality .", 
                "here is an extract where he identified loopholes in current wealth taxes .", 
                "he said : the present system is a patchwork of different taxes , all flawed in different ways and full of loopholes .", 
                "inheritance tax allowances have grown more generous reflecting house price inflation and there is considerable scope for avoidance through gift before death .", 
                "capital gains tax too has a plethora of reliefs .", 
                "britain has no tax on property values as such and council tax serves as a very unsatisfactory substitute based on ancient property values and not proportional to property or land values .", 
                "one could add various wealth related charges like stamp duty .", 
                "together these taxes raise around \u00a3 50 bn a year of which half is council tax : representing , overall , half of one percent of household net wealth .", 
                "he called for more public investment , saying never in british economic history has it been cheaper for a bold , active government to borrow for productive investment '' .", 
                "he said he wanted higher taxes for foreigners buying property in the uk for investment , and measures to curb absentee second home ownership '' .", 
                "i want to see fierce tax penalties on the acquisition of property for investment purposes , by overseas residents .", 
                "and i want to see rural communities protected from the blight of absentee second home ownership , which devastates local economies and pushes young people away from the places where they grew up .",

                "( see 11.25am . )",
