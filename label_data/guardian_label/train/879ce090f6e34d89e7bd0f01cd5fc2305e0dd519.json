                "here are the main points from the johnson/tillerson press conference .", 
                "boris johnson , the foreign secretary , said the government was actively investigating how the aid budget can be used to help british territories devasted by hurricane irma .", 
                "he was responding to a question about whether he accepted the current assessment , which is that the \u00a3 13bn aid budget can not be used because the territories are too rich to qualify for help under under official international aid criteria .", 
                "johnson said : anybody who has seen the effects of the hurricane , it 's absolutely catastrophic - i 've never seen anything like it .", 
                "it 's destruction which you see in images from the first world war .", 
                "and i think anybody with an ounce of compassion would want to see spending by our government in getting those people back on their feet and indeed on getting those british - and i stress british - overseas territories helped in the long term .", 
                "and of course we are looking now across whitehall at ways in which we can make sure that our aid budget can be used in that way , and i know that priti patel [ the international development secretary ] , all my colleagues , are looking at how we can do that .", 
                "that is absolutely natural and we are on that right now .", 
                "he said the burmese leader aung san suu kyi should use her moral capital '' to stop the massacre of rohingya muslims and to ensure that they are allowed to return to myanmar in safety .", 
                "asked if regretted praising her recently in the light of her inaction over this , he said that 370,000 rohingya had fled the country in desperation .", 
                "he went on : let 's be clear .", 
                "[ aung san suu kyi ] led burma [ myanmar ] after a period of decades of repression by a military junta .", 
                "and i yield to no one in my admiration of what she stood for , and the way she fought for democracy .", 
                "i think many people around the world share that admiration .", 
                "i think it is now vital for her to use that moral capital and that authority to make the point about the suffering of the people of rakhine .", 
                "nobody wants to see a return to military rule in burma .", 
                "nobody wants to see a return of the generals .", 
                "but it is also vital that the civilian government , and that is [ aung san suu kyi ] , for whom , as i say , i have a great deal of admiration , but it is vital for her now to make clear that this is an abomination and that those people will be allowed back to burma and that preparation is being made and that the abuse of their human rights and the killings will stop .", 
                "rex tillerson , the us secretary of state , said america thought iran was in breach of its obligations under the nuclear deal ( the jcpoa - joint comprehensive plan of action ) .", 
                "the trump administration was still reviewing its iran policy , he said , and had not come to a conclusion .", 
                "but he went on : but i think it is worth noting , as the administration continues its review of the jcpoa , president trump has made it clear to those of us who are developing this policy that we must take into account the totality of iranian threats , not just iran 's nuclear capability .", 
                "that is one piece of our posture towards iran .", 
                "and if one revists the preface to the jcpoa , that preface reads that the participants anticipate that full implementation of this jcpoa will positively contribute to regional and international peace and security '' .", 
                "that was one of the expectations of the jcpoa .", 
                "and in our view iran is clearly in default of these expectations of the jcpoa , through their actions to prop up the assad regime , to engage in malicious activities in the region , including cyber activity , aggressively developing ballistic missiles .", 
                "and all of this is in defiance of un security resolution 2231 , thereby threatening , not ensuring , threatening the security of those in the region , as well as the united states itself .",
