                "david davis has promised that british mps and peers will be able to scrutinise , amend and vote on the final brexit agreement through primary legislation in a concession to pro-eu conservative backbenchers .", 
                "although this did not come as a complete surprise - number 10 hinted it was planning this move two weeks ago , and ministers were under pressure to concede because otherwise they were facing a likely defeat on this matter during the eu withdrawal bill 's committee stage - it nevertheless amounts to a potentially significant announcement .", 
                "pro-brexit mps did not seem especially happy about what davis had to say , and the labour party said it was a significant climbdown .", 
                "( see 4.56pm . )", 
                "in theory this means that the house of commons , which probably contains a decisive soft brexit majority , could start rewriting the brexit transition and withdrawal deal if , as planned , it is agreed next autumn .", 
                "but in the commons davis admitted that his promise to implement the withdrawal deal through an act of parliament would only take effect if a deal actually gets agreed .", 
                "if there is no deal , there wo n't be a bill .", 
                "and , as davis admitted in the commons , even if the commons does vote to change the withdrawal deal , there is no guarantee that brussels will agree to its proposals .", 
                "when labour 's clive efford asked davis what would happen if the commons amends the legislation to demand a different sort of withdrawal , davis replied : if he house does that [ votes to change the bill ] , that will be taken i guess by the government as an instruction to go back and speak for them [ to brussels ] .", 
                "whether that will deliver any outcome , i do n't know .", 
                "in private government sources are even blunter , suggesting that there is very little chance of amendments to the bill passed by the commons leading to the eu agreeing to change the terms of a brexit deal already negotiated by the government .",
