                "at 11am this morning , on the first stroke of big ben , the deep boom of a first world war field gun will echo through whitehall , and the heart of a great city will fall silent , an event so unusual that it is invariably a slightly eerie experience , when a single cough in the street or a seagull 's cry overhead can sound as shockingly loud as the inevitable distant siren 's wail .", 
                "this year the ceremony , echoed at thousands of war memorials and churches across the country and overseas , carries an extra freight of emotion , marking the the centenary of the outbreak of the first world war.long before the live television coverage begins at10.30 am , whitehall will be full , with crowds ten deep on the pavements nearest the cenotaph .", 
                "myself and aisha gani will be following the events of the day in britain and overseas , with the help of colleagues already in place in whitehall .", 
                "at least 10,000 people are expected to march past the cenotaph after the official wreath laying , taking adding their own poppy tributes until the monument is surrounded by a carpet of scarlet .", 
                "there are no more veterans of the first world war , and the ranks of the second world war veterans grow thinner every year .", 
                "as well as the official events in churches and at war memorials , the day will be marked by a ceremony at the national arboretum , where the armed forces memorial is inscribed with the 16,000 names who have died on duty or as a result of terrorism since the end of the second world war in 1948 .", 
                "when the monument was created , blank space was left on the portland stone walls , which has been needed as more names are added every year .",
