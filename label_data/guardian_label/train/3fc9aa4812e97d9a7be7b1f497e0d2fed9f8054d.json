                "the final day of the labour conference has been overshadowed by a row over nuclear weapons , after the shadow defence secretary criticised jeremy corbyn for saying he would instruct defence chiefs never to use the trident missiles .", 
                "tom watson , labour 's deputy leader , has said labour will never win another election unless it champions those running micro-businesses .", 
                "in a substantial speech - one of the best of the conference , and much more weighty than the usual end-of-confence knockabout - he said labour would never win an election unless it stood up for people running small businesses .", 
                "5.2 million private sector businesses in the uk , employing more than 25 million people .", 
                "96 per cent of these are micro business , with 0-9 employees .", 
                "that 's a third of all private sector employees in the uk .", 
                "more than 8 million people in 5 million businesses .", 
                "and the proportion 's growing all the time , faster than any other segment of the economy .", 
                "these people are not posh .", 
                "they 're not privileged .", 
                "they 're not greedy or selfish or stupid .", 
                "they work hard , they want to get on , but they also care about their neighbours and the communities we share .", 
                "they 're our people , and we 're their party - or we are nothing .", 
                "if we do n't speak for the 0-9ers , we will never win another election .", 
                "and they need a political voice .", 
                "the tories do n't care about them .", 
                "as john mcdonnell said on monday , the tories are the party of the 1 per cent , the super-privileged who own the land and the money .",

                "they do n't use our schools or hospitals , which feeds their contempt for our public services .", 
                "he also called for more working class labour candidates , saying there were too many former special advisers at the top of the parliamentary party .", 
                "and an even greater waste of our natural talent is the lack of working class labour mps .",

                "simple as that .", 
                "no offence to any individual , but there are too many special advisers at the top of the parliamentary labour party .", 
                "do n't get me wrong , we need special advisers , but we ca n't afford to be a party which only promotes people like that .", 
                "we ca n't afford a shadow cabinet which is monochrome and monocultural .", 
                "our movement and our country are richer and better than that .", 
                "and he called for councillors to be given a bigger role in policy making .", 
                "there should be no important decision made at the national level on which labour councillors are not consulted .", 
                "it 's councillors who actually run services and represent us every day on the front line .",

                "when the original inquiry was set up , this part of it was postponed because of ongoing criminal trials .", 
                "burnham also called for inquiries into police behaviour at orgreave and in the shrewsbury building workers case .", 
                "we do n't know the full extent of the collusion between police and press and that 's why the second inquiry recommended by lord leveson must go ahead .", 
                "we wo n't know the full story of hillsborough until we know what the same police force did to the miners in the aftermath of orgreave .", 
                "and to understand how an anti-trade-union culture developed in parts of the police , we need the full story about the false convictions and imprisonment of building workers in shrewsbury .", 
                "i will make it my personal priority in this job to put the pieces of this jigsaw together - alongside other historical injustices we have seen : the abuse of stop and search powers against black and asian young people ; and particularly child sexual exploitation .", 
                "sadiq khan , labour 's candidate for london mayor , has pledged to turn the election into a referendum on the capital 's housing crisis , calling on his conservative opponent to stand up to the government 's housing bill .",
