                "in a rare intervention in uk politics , and one of the most substantial speeches so far by any participant in the election campaign , blair praised ed miliband for refusing to match tory plans for a referendum and he said the very prospect of withdrawal from the eu would create significant business uncertainty '' .", 
                "if britain did vote to leave , negotiating exit would be horrible '' , and much harder than people expected , he said .", 
                "there is , in my view , also a complete under-estimation of the short term pain of negotiating exit .", 
                "there would be a raft of different treaties , association agreements and partnerships to be dis-entangled and re-negotiated .", 
                "there would be significant business uncertainty in the run-up to a vote but should the vote go the way of exit , then there would be the most intense period of business anxiety , reconsideration of options and instability since the war .", 
                "blair has swallowed any qualms about declaring his full support for ed miliband , saying he agrees with the labour leader that inequality is the central challenge of the times .",

                "radburn/pa ed miliband has said that today 's a & e waiting time figures for england , which are the worst for a decade ( see 10.19am ) , are partly explained by the government 's failure to improve access to gps .", 
                "speaking in bristol this morning he said : we 've just seen figures today published for waiting times in england 's a & e departments which show that the first three months in this year was the worst period since the four-hour a & e target was introduced over a decade ago .", 
                "and one of the reasons for that is it 's got a lot harder to see a gp - a lot harder to see a gp .",

                "as the press association reports , at a press conference osborne asked repeatedly to rule it out and did not , but said that if the tories had wanted to include child benefit in the new welfare system , they would have done so when it was created .", 
                "the institute for fiscal studies ( ifs ) has said that scrapping child benefit and increasing uc for eligible families could save 4.8 billion a year .", 
                "but such a measure would mean that 4.3m families who receive child benefit at the moment but would not be entitled to uc in the future would lose more than \u00a3 1,000 a year , the ifs said .", 
                "at the press conference , mr osborne was asked to rule out rolling child benefit into uc .", 
                "he replied : if you judge us on our approach in this parliament and if we wanted to put child benefit into universal credit , we would have done it when we set up universal credit .",

                "she said : even if the tories are the largest party , i have said we will vote to stop the tory government getting off the ground .", 
                "i have asked ed miliband to confirm that labour will do likewise .",

                "i hope to hear him give that commitment before too much more time elapses because as long as he fails to give that commitment he leaves lingering the sus that labour would rather see the tories get back into power than work with the snp .",

                "at his press conference this morning he said : the labour party only talked about balancing the current , day to day , spending while continuing to borrow to pay for capital spending .",
