                "he accused news organisations of euro-centric bias .", 
                "there 's also been debates over what should and should n't be included by the press .", 
                "several french news organisations have just said that they will no longer publish photos of people responsible for terrorist killings to avoid avoid bestowing posthumous glorification '' .", 
                "in an editorial after the murder of an elderly priest in a church near rouen by two men claiming allegiance to islamic state , le monde argued that all elements of society had to be involved in the struggle against terrorism , and that media organisations had a special role to play .", 
                "then there 's the nature of coverage : research conducted by michael jetter , a professor at the school of economics and finance at universidad eafit in medell\u00edn , colombia , found that sensationalist media coverage of terrorism results in more similar acts .", 
                "many have argued that news organisations are often quick to call all attacks terrorism , whether it 's been proven or not , encouraging fear and inciting hatred .", 
                "others feel the opposite and that we 're too reluctant to use this word .", 
                "so what 's your view on this ?",
