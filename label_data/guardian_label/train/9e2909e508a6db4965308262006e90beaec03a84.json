                "if there had been a clapometer in the room , david lammy would have probably won it .", 
                "a colleague tells me there seemed to be a disproportionate number of lammy supporters in the room , and that may explain why , but he did seem to be the candidate getting the most applause .", 
                "on the minus side , he was the candidate most liable to sound a bit hectoring .", 
                "but , on the plus side , he certainly pushed the right buttons .", 
                "his answers on dirty money '' in the city ( see 8.21pm ) and on the danger posed by rising house prices ( see 8.46pm ) were two of the highlights of the evening .", 
                "to be fair , though , the hustings had many good moments .", 
                "covering labour leadership hustings has become a dreary , soul-destroying affair , not so much because the candidates are saying the same things ( though they are ) , but because they seem nervous about saying anything new , and the chief interest lies in seeing how the two front-runners , andy burnham and yvette cooper , align themselves closest to where they perceive the centre of political gravity in the party to be .", 
                "in this contest , partly because the powers of the mayor are different , the dynamic seems quite different .", 
                "an observer hearing these six for the first time would be hard pressed to place them on an ideological spectrum , and instead the debate was one about practical ideas .", 
                "there are been many labour london mayoral hustings already and the selling points of the candidates are well established .", 
                "tessa jowell would be the olym mayor ; the person with experience , who made the games a success .", 
                "diane abbott 's reference point was ken livingstone , and she would resurrect his approach .", 
                "lammy and sadiq khan both highlight their upbringing , and the fact that they did not come from a privileged background .", 
                "thomas is the co-operative candidate ; he is chair of the co-operative party .", 
                "and christian wolmar is the non-parliamentary expert , the only candidate not to have been an mp .", 
                "all six stuck to these roles tonight , and when polly toynbee and rafael behr said labour supporters had a good choice , they were not just being polite .", 
                "no one is saying that about the party leadership contest .", 
                "overall the tone was friendly , although it was interesting to note the snide asides .", 
                "khan was talking about lammy when he said that he ( khan ) would not build on the green belt , unlike others .", 
                "abbott had a dig at khan , saying , unlike him , she had not changed her mind on heathrow .", 
                "but her sharpest barb was directed at jowell .", 
                "more than once she said that , unlike jowell ( the favourite ) , she had not just worked on stop-and-search for six months ; it had been a lifelong cause .", 
                "from the party 's point of view , the only drawback may have been the tendency of the candidates to agree on too much .", 
                "when wolmar said that he was not impressed by the case for a youth mayor , because the issue of youth disengagement demanded a more substantial approach , he introduced a surprise moment of dissent .", 
                "( see 7.55pm . )", 
                "and spare a thought for my colleague , rafael behr .", 
                "when he suggested that the financial services industry was such a powerful revenue-raiser for the uk that a labour mayor would not simply be able to bash it ( see 8.16pm ) , i feared he might get lynched .", 
                "none of the candidates really engaged with his point .", 
                "but in the full mayoral contest , against a conservative opponent , the successful labour candidate will not be able to avoid this problem so easily ."
