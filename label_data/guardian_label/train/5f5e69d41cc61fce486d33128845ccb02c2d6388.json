                "here are the main points from david davis 's morning interviews .", 
                "davis rejected claims that theresa may 's article 50 letter contained an implicit blackmail threat in relation to security .", 
                "the letter did not amount to blackmail , he said .", 
                "we want a deal .", 
                "that 's the point .", 
                "we want a deal .", 
                "and [ theresa may ] was making the point that it is bad for both of us if we do n't have a deal .", 
                "that , i think , is a perfectly reasonable point to make and not in any sense a threat .", 
                "he said eu leaders found the tone of the letter very positive .", 
                "i spent all of yesterday afternoon on the telephone talking to my opposite numbers in the parliament , in the commission , around all the member states .", 
                "virtually all of them said spontaneously , it 's a very positive letter , the tone was good , and so on .", 
                "he admitted that there would be an argument about the structure of the talks .", 
                "the uk wants the talks covering departure and the talks covering a new trade deal to take place at the same time , while the european commission wants them to happen one after the other .", 
                "there is an area of argument over this .", 
                "which is fine .", 
                "and that will go on .", 
                "davis explained why the uk government wanted the negotiations to take place in parallel .", 
                "the reason we want to see it done in parallel is we think the best way to get a deal is to look at the whole package together .", 
                "and he said the text of article 50 itself backs the government 's case , because it says the departure talks must take into account the future relationship .", 
                "the key sentence says : the union shall negotiate and conclude an agreement with that state [ the one leaving ] , setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal , taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the union .", 
                "he admitted it would take time to bring immigration down .", 
                "the government wanted to do this in a smooth and orderly way , he said .", 
                "asked how long this would take , he initially said it was a matter for the home secretary .", 
                "then he said : not a very long time .", 
                "but it will take time .", 
                "he said the government was serious about wanting to conclude a trade deal with the eu within two years .", 
                "it is absolutely not a joke , he said , in response to claims this timetable is wholly unrealistic .", 
                "davis explained why he thought this was possible .", 
                "it is the only free trade deal in the history of the world in which the country involved is already in a free trade arrangement with the other countries and has got identical product standards .", 
                "one of the things that takes all the time [ in trade deals ] - not all the time , lots of time - is actually getting the standards harmonised .", 
                "we are going to be in exactly the same place .", 
                "he admitted that , over time , the government would want to change the eu rules that apply to the uk .", 
                "the great repeal bill will introduce all eu law into uk law , so that at the point of brexit there is continuity , he said .", 
                "but he said after that the government and parliament would be free to change these laws , taking as long as they wanted .", 
                "many eu laws were good and would be kept , he said .", 
                "but he said there were some people would want to change .", 
                "newnight 's chris cook points out an obvious contradiction between this point , and the point davis was making about why a trade deal could quickly be negotiated .", 
                "chris cook ( @ xtophercook ) david davis rather glides over what eu recognition of our standards might mean for our ability to remove eu law after we 're out .", 
                "davis said he would sum up his mood yesterday as excited for the future of my country .", 
                "david davis leaving number 10 after cabinet yesterday .",
