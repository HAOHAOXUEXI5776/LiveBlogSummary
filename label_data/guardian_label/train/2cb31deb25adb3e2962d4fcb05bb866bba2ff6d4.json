                "dear sue , i am writing to you in your capacity as chair of the broadcasters ' leaders ' debates '' committee .", 
                "as you know , i have had serious concerns about the way in which this has been handled from the start .", 
                "despite the prime minister having been clear about his concern around holding debates in the short campaign , you did not consult us before issuing a press release last october outlining your plans for three debates during that period .", 
                "had you consulted us , we could have also told you that we also did not think it was appropriate to exclude the green party from the process .", 
                "despite all of this , we then entered into negotiations in good faith , during which i made the case for a more representative debates structure , including the greens .", 
                "it is fair to say that the desire to exclude the greens was clear from all other parties present .", 
                "three months later - and again without consultation - you surprised us again by proposing a new seven-party structure , this time not only inviting the greens , but plaid cymru and the snp as well .", 
                "again , this was a flawed proposal - that has resulted in the dup initiating what appears to be legitimate legal action .", 
                "since this proposal has been suggested , there has been chaos .", 
                "in recent weeks , you have avoided letting the parties sit in a room to hammer out proposals , making progress impossible .", 
                "in order to cut through this chaotic situation i am willing to make the following proposal : there should be one 90-minute debate between seven party leaders before the short campaign .", 
                "as well as the prime minister , the leaders of the green party , labour , liberal democrats , plaid cymru , snp and ukip should invited .", 
                "the leader of the dup should be allowed to make his case for why he should be involved .", 
                "if the broadcasters can not agree amongst themselves who hosts the debate , lots should be drawn , though the debate should be freely available to whoever wants to broadcast it .", 
                "in order for it to be organised in time , the debate should take place during the week beginning the 23rd march .", 
                "i will make myself available to negotiate the details .", 
                "having been the editor of numerous broadcast news and current affairs programmes , i know this is ample time to organise a programme .", 
                "this is our final offer , and to be clear , given the fact this has been a deeply unsatisfactory process and we are within a month of the short campaign , the prime minister will not be participating in more than one debate .", 
                "yours sincerely , craig oliver prime minister 's director of communications"
