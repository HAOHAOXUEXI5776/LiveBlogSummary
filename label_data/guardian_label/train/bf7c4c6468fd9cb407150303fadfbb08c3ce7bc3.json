                "a record 80 % -plus of catalan voters cast their ballots in the snap election triggered by prime minister mariano rajoy when madrid took control of the region in october after its illegal referendum and unilateral declaration of independence .", 
                "the unionist citizens finished as the largest single party in parliament , but its 36 seats were not enough to form a majority government with other parties in favour of catalonia remaining a part of spain .", 
                "rajoy 's centre-right people 's party lost nearly three-quarters of its seats , collapsing from 11 to just four .", 
                "pro-independence politicians including carles puigdemont , the ousted regional president currently evading arrest in brussels , lined up to say the vote represented a popular repudiation of article 155 of the spanish constitution , which allowed madrid to take direct control of the region .", 
                "the pro-independence parties did not , however , win the popular vote , failing once again to secure a share of more than 50 % .", 
                "the winning parties will now try to form a coalition , although it is unclear how easy that will be : there are tensions between juntsxcat and the erc , and the cup 's insistence on unilateral independence could make relations with madrid even trickier .", 
                "just restoring self-government and seeking the release of imprisoned leaders may absorb much of the movement 's energy ."
