                "good morning blogans , # politicslive is back for a guest appearance to talk energy policy as the south australian government rolls out its much-vaunted plans to solve that state 's looming crisis .", 
                "as it happened , last night 's storms across central and northern new south wales gave me a taste of south australian life at twilight .", 
                "the power went down , flickered and then went out after a lightning strike to our lines that made me drop the sauce bottle .", 
                "but the nation is facing more serious problems than my lightning strike .", 
                "australia is finally coming to the pointy end of the lack of energy planning over the past decade .", 
                "this week political debate has reached peak energy mode .", 
                "consider the list of events , reports and dire predictions in the past week .", 
                "on thursday , the australian energy market operator warned that australia is facing energy shortages if governments do not carry out national planning as exports continue to dominate the country 's gas supply .", 
                "the aemo report predicts new south wales , victoria and south australia will be impacted from the summer of 2018-19 and warns that the tightening of the domestic gas market will have flow-on effects to the electricity sector unless there is an increase in gas supplies and development .", 
                "take home message : businesses will close because of the shortages .", 
                "on the same day , malcolm turnbull said he would call all the ceos of the major gas companies to ask what they were going to do to ensure they could provide gas to their customers .", 
                "that meeting is tomorrow .", 
                "and still on thursday , the energy and environment minister josh frydenberg again ruled out a domestic gas reservation policy but said he was quite partial to the queensland government 's move to reserve a specific area for domestic production .", 
                "the coalition 's argument has been that a domestic reservation policy - like the us or indonesia or israel - would frighten off investors .", 
                "on monday , the australian competition and consumer commission chair rod sims called on gas companies to support the domestic market so aforementioned businesses do n't close for the want of gas .", 
                "but sims also ruled out a gas reservation on the same grounds as the government .", 
                "scare the investors .", 
                "then the grattan institute warned governments may need to re-regulate electricity prices because a decade of competition had failed to deliver the promised consumer benefits .",

                "while our colleague max opray is in the lock up in south australia , the adelaide advertiser is reporting that the south australian government has closely considered the option of new interconnectors between adelaide and the eastern states and it has also been urged to buy its own power station .", 
                "the advertiser 's peter jean reported last year that : a new electricity interconnector between south australia and the eastern states could be operational by 2021 and would cost between $ 500 million and $ 2.5 billion , power network operator electranet says .", 
                "a government buying a new power station sounds like a radical solution but it should be noted that weatherill and his energy minister tom koutsantonis have not ruled out any options - including a state based carbon price .", 
                "jean reports : people believe that energy is such an essential service that they think the government should still be running it but , if they 're not , it has to be in charge , he told the advertiser .", 
                "that 's really what this is about , taking charge .", 
                "the objective is obviously to make our power supply more reliable ( and ) to put downward pressure on prices , but the other element which is really critical is the jobs question .",
