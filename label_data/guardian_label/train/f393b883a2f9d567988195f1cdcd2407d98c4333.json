                "an early start for the politics live blog today , which for under-pressure priti patel according to some reports could be her last as a member of this cabinet .", 
                "patel , the international development secretary , is in uganda with international trade secretary liam fox .", 
                "but attention is instead on israel , where patel held 12 undisclosed meetings with senior officials including prime minister benjamin netanyahu during an unusually busy family holiday to the country in israel .", 
                "late on tuesday night , it emerged that patel had two further meetings in september without notifying fellow ministers .", 
                "and in 13 of those 14 meetings , she was accompanied by lord polak , a lobbyist and a leading member of conservative friends of israel something the times reported would be a further breach of the ministerial code .", 
                "amid reports this morning that patel 's timetabled events in uganda have been cancelled , the political twitter consensus is that patel is now breakfast toast : robert peston ( @ peston ) so i am hearing that priti patel is likely to be sacked within hours .", 
                "that would be two cabinet ministers gone in a week .", 
                "laura kuenssberg ( @ bbclaurak ) as i understand it - the 2 have n't talked yet , no 10 are not sacking her tonight , but it 's very likely in the morning ( only 90mins of today to go ) however : laura kuenssberg ( @ bbclaurak ) but do n't forget govt so fragile , if there is a way to keep patel that does n't look insane , number 10 might go for it"
