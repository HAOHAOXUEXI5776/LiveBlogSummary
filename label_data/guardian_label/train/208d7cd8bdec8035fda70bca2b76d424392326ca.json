                "that may be true in numerical terms , but when you look at this as a percentage of their trade , you can clearly see that the eu exports a lot more broadly , to a whole host of other markets , and consequently , it is far less dependant on the uk as a market than the uk is on it .", 
                "this will have significant implications for upcoming negotiations ."
