                "not ever .", 
                "ever at all .",

                "partly that 's because the aftermath of the referendum dominated the news agenda over the weekend , but it 's also because senior figures in the party were so engaged with scotland over the last fortnight that they they gave the conference less attention than usual .", 
                "also , compared to the enormity of what was at stake last week , the conference proceedings seemed relatively inconsequential .", 
                "2 - labour is going to need a better answer to the west lothian question .", 
                "going into a general election campaign , parties need robust answers to the tricky questions they are going to face day after day from opponents and the media .", 
                "with david cameron determined to make why should scottish mps vote on english-only laws ? ''", 
                "a key conservative issue , labour will be vulnerable unless it can construct a stronger response than the vague and evasive complicated issue , constitutional convention next autumn '' line that it has been deploying all this week .", 
                "3 - and labour has now realised it has a serious problem in scotland too .", 
                "many mps and activists at the conference travelled from england or wales to scotland to campaign in the referendum and they came back alarmed at how feeble the party 's machine is in some areas .",

                "as jon cruddas acknowledged at a conference fringe , there has been tension in the party between those wanting to fight the election offering bold plans to reshape the economy , and those happier with a more cautious offer and waiting for the government to muck up .", 
                "on balance , the gradualists have seen off the visionaries , although there 's been something of a compromise .", 
                "ed miliband did offer a 10-year prospectus for the future , but his policy proposals fall well short of re-ordering capitalism and his key announcement was a conventional , old-fashioned spending commitment , funded by tax raid on baddies '' ( the rich and cigarette companies ) .",

                "miliband 's focus in his speech on the people who feel the system does not work for them shows that he has some understanding of what is driving ukip support , and speakers at the conference repeatedly attacked the party in very strong terms .", 
                "but labour has not found a reliable strategy for containing ukip , and there are two forthcoming elections - the heywood and middleton by-election and south yorkshire police commissioner by-election - where labour frontrunners are seen as very vulnerable to a ukip challenge .", 
                "7 - miliband is now more confident than ever about not offering an in/out referendum on the eu .",

                "being anti-referendum is one of labour 's best pro-business policies , and the party even gave the airbus boss , robin southwell , a speaking slot on the platform to make that point .", 
                "8 - labour is not confident of winning a clear majority .", 
                "the mood here is far from despondent , but it is hardly upbeat either , and there is considerable uncertainty about what will happen next may .", 
                "9 - but labour is arguably the most unified of all three main political parties .",

                "miliband 's leadership is not an issue ( at least until after the election ) , the unions back the leadership , the new labourites have faded and the only real argument that broke out this week , about english devolution , was muted .", 
                "the tories are far more divided , on issues like scotland and europe , and the lib dems have not resolved where they go after 2015 .",
