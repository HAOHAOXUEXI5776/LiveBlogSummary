                "this has been - in my view unwisely - frozen since the government took office .", 
                "but with the recent collapse in the oil price , an increase of , say , 5p a litre , which would bring in some \u00a3 2 billion a year , has much to be said for it the most important reason for collecting an extra \u00a3 2bn from the petrol tax is that , coupled with the likely strengthening of the public finances , and some further public expenditure savings , it would give mr osborne the scope to cut a penny of the basic rate of income tax .", 
                "the economic benefit would be significant , and the political impact massive , as i discovered when i took a penny off in 1986 - the first such reduction for seven years .", 
                "alas , this is unlikely .", 
                "the practice of negotiating the budget with the liberal democrats , which has caused budget-making to be such a nightmare during this parliament , means that any scope for reducing income tax will be frittered away in a further rise in personal allowances .", 
                "he also says that winter fuel payments should be abolished .", 
                "[ osborne ] could decide that the elderly are aware that they use more fuel in winter , and should not be patronised by being given a winter fuel payment , as if the onset of winter always takes them by surprise .", 
                "this should be done by replacing the winter fuel payment with an equivalent increase in the basic pension - which is , of course , taxable ; thus ending , in the simplest possible way , the nonsense of the rich receiving a tax-free christmas present from the state , and making a modest improvement to the public finances at the same time .", 
                "sadly , i do n't expect to see this desirable reform implemented just yet , but its day will surely come .", 
                "daniel finkelstein in the times ( paywall ) says the budget wo n't decide the election .",

                "this suggests that budget announcements often mean something quite different to politicians than to most members of the public and an announcement that seems impressive to the one may leave the other cold .",
