                "there was some good news for jeremy corbyn and his supporters on the bbc at lunchtime .", 
                "the world at one reported on some research showing that labour did not lose the election because it was too leftwing .", 
                "it was based on the latest piece of research from the british election study , a long-running academic study that investigates voting .", 
                "the bes is heavy-duty political science .", 
                "it is not just based on the odd yougov poll .", 
                "it tracks a large number of voters over time , using regression analysis to explore what the factors are that change the way people vote .", 
                "the findings are very relevant to labour because the party is broadly split between those like tony blair who think the party was too leftwing at the general election and those like corbyn who think it was not leftwing enough .", 
                "superficially ( and on the basis of the bbc headline ) corbyn and his supporters should welcome the analysis .", 
                "but if you read the full report , a long article for the ippr 's juncture journal by the bes 's jane green and chris prosser , you 'll see that the bes analysis is probably more valuable to labour moderates .", 
                "if if finds that labour did not lose the election because it was too leftwing , it also finds that there is not much [ evidence ] to support the argument that labour was not leftwing enough '' .", 
                "it argues that economic credibility was a fundamental problem for the party ( a blairite argument ) .", 
                "and it says non-voting was a particular problem for labour .", 
                "corbyn thinks labour can make big gains by getting non-voters to turn out , but the report suggests they might not vote whatever the party does .", 
                "the report identifies six reasons why labour lost .", 
                "i 've summarised them here .", 
                "1 - the financial crash damaged labour as badly as the erm crisis damaged the tories in 1992 .", 
                "that is because it fundamentally altered the public perception of which party could be trusted on the economy '' .", 
                "the article suggests this was a fatal problem .", 
                "given how long it took the conservatives to recover a lead , it must be questionable whether labour could have undone this shock to its ratings between 2010 and 2015 .", 
                "2 - ed miliband was a problem .", 
                "even though miliband was perceived as having a better campaign then david cameron , research found that miliband accounted for fewer vote gains and more vote losses than the other party leaders did for their parties '' .", 
                "3 - winning votes from the lib dems harmed labour .", 
                "this is paradoxical , but it helps to explain why labour increased its vote share in england by 3.6 % , but gained just 15 seats , while the tories increased their vote share in england by 1.4 % but gained 21 seats labour 's gains in taking votes away from the lib dems helped secure conservative victories against the lib dems in these vulnerable seats .", 
                "that is to say , it was labour 's vote gains that helped to deprive labour of an overall majority or largest party status .", 
                "there was a tactical unwind that cost the liberal democrats seats but delivered those seats to the conservatives .", 
                "examining in greater detail those seats which switched from lib dem to conservative , of the votes the lib dems lost , around 43 per cent went to labour and 31 per cent to the conservatives .", 
                "we estimate ( using calculations of vote change in these seats ) that the gains by labour from former lib-dem voters alone delivered seven former lib-dem seats to the conservatives .", 
                "this tactical unwind will obviously have made a contribution in a larger number of seats also .", 
                "simplistically , labour needs to lose votes to the lib-dems to cut into the conservative majority , or it needs to defeat the conservatives in seats where it was previously not in contention .", 
                "4 - the collapse of labour support in scotland .", 
                "labour will have a very difficult time recapturing its lost voters in scotland '' because loss of support to the snp was not just related to the independence referendum , the report says .", 
                "the referendum provided a rallying point for voters who were already dissatisfied with labour . ''", 
                "5- labour had a problem with its supporters not voting .", 
                "one of the problems for labour in 2015 was that a proportion of potential voters did not get to the polls .", 
                "we think it is very likely that many of these voters were never going to vote , irrespective of the party 's efforts , but it certainly seems the case that part of labour 's problem was that it increased its support among non-voters .", 
                "6 - the tories did better than labour at winning over lib dem and ukip voters in conservative/labour battlegrounds .", 
                "the report also dismisses what it says are two red herrings about the reasons for labour 's defeat .", 
                "labour did not lose because it was too leftwing , it says .", 
                "the evidence for this is research comparing the probability of someone voting labour with how they perceived labour on a left/right axis .", 
                "generally , the more they thought the party was leftwing , the more likely they were to vote for it .", 
                "predicted probability of voting chart but the report says this does not mean that labour would have done better if it had been more leftwing .", 
                "this suggests there is very little to the argument that labour was too left-wing to attract voters .", 
                "at the same time there is not much to support the argument that labour was not left-wing enough .", 
                "there was very little difference in the likelihood of voting labour between someone who thought labour sat at the left-most end of the scale ( 0 ) and someone who saw it as just left of centre ( 4 ) - it is only when people saw labour as sitting to the right of this point that support really drops off .", 
                "the report also says it is not clear whether a party can be seen as leftwing and competent on the economy .", 
                "fear of the snp does not seem to have been a factor in the tories gaining votes or labour losing them , the report says .", 
                "but it does not say that this definitely was n't a factor ; just that it can not find any proof .", 
                "we can not say for sure that this did n't matter , but our explorations suggest it is a difficult effect to pin down .", 
                "this claim seems questionable , because during the election there was a considerable amount of anecdotal evidence suggesting that the prospect of a minority government being dependent on the snp did alarm voters .", 
                "this is from philip cowley , who is co-writing the official nuffield study of the general election .", 
                "philip cowley ( @ philipjcowley ) this looks v interesting , but the idea the snp in 2015 is a red herring is just crazy philip cowley ( @ philipjcowley ) and there is a real problem trying to identify this using polling that we know is flawed that 's all from me for now .", 
                "i will be launching another blog tonight , just after 10pm , to cover john mcdonnell , the new shadow chancellor , and alex salmond , the former scottish first minister , on bbc 's question time .",
