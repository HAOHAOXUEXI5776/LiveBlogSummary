                "the report sets out the cause of the blackout in these critical stages : tornadoes with wind speeds in the range of 190 to 260 km/h damaging three transmission lines caused them to trip ( disconnect to protect the rest of the system ) , resulting in voltage dips .", 
                "nine windfarms in the mid-north of sa reduced power as a protection feature was activated .", 
                "a significant increase in imported power flowing through the heywood interconnector , reached such a level that it activated a special protection scheme that tripped the interconnector offline .", 
                "the sa power system then became separated from the rest of the national electricity market , resulting in the remaining generation being much less than the connected load and unable to maintain the islanded system frequency .", 
                "as a result , all supply to the sa region was lost at 4.18 pm \u0080\u00a6 aemo 's analysis shows that following system separation , frequency collapse and the consequent [ blackout ] was inevitable .", 
                "aemo suggested that as the electricity mix changes it is no longer appropriate to rely solely on synchronous generators to provide essential non-energy system services ( such as voltage control , frequency control , inertia , and system strength ) .", 
                "it suggests that the grid should also be stabilised with non-synchronous generators where technically feasible .", 
                "the report said aemo has begun work with the australian renewable energy authority trialling new technologies , starting with use of the new hornsdale stage two windfarm to provide grid stabilisation services .",
