                "remember , there was only seven years between david steel taking over the liberal leadership in 1976 after the devastation of the thorpe scandal and the alliance 's record-breaking vote in 1983 .", 
                "i do n't see why our recovery should n't be much more swift than we fear , but it is not a given , we will have to earn it .", 
                "he said he believed certain values were at the heart of liberalism .", 
                "they are : liberty , democracy , fairness , internationalism , environmentalism and quality of life .",

                "at the general election nick clegg and his team refused to express a preference for either of the two main parties .", 
                "farron criticised both of them , but he did not profess to be equidistant between them .", 
                "he said : liberal democrats have tended to see the labour party as closer to our own progressive aims , partly because we have more of a history of cooperation with labour governments - in scotland from 1999 to 2007 , in wales from 2001 to 2003 , or in the lib-lab pact in the 1970s .", 
                "and i think they score a little better than the tories on some of my tests : the last years of the last labour government saw positive developments in environmental policy , they fought the last election on a redistributive package that nicked one of its main planks - the mansion tax - from us , and they 're generally supportive of uk membership of the eu .",

                "i admire [ the greens ' ] dedication and their commitment to environmental aims , but at base they value the planet over its human inhabitants , which leads them into authoritarian and illiberal territory .",
