                "mps have already spent almost 50 hours debating the eu withdrawal bill at committee stage and so far the government has not lost a vote .", 
                "tonight that could change .", 
                "the key argument is over amendment 7 , tabled by dominic grieve , the conservative former attorney general and backed by a significant number of tories , as well as the opposition parties .", 
                "the bill , in clause 9 , gives ministers powers to implement the brexit withdrawal agreement by order .", 
                "the amendment says they could only exercise these powers subject to the prior enactment of a statute by parliament approving the final terms of withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union .", 
                "it has been commonly described as an amendment designed to ensure that parliament would get a meaningful vote on the withdrawal agreement .",

                "the key passage is this one , promising mps that the government will not use the powers in clause 9 until the commons has voted for a resolution backing the withdrawal agreement .", 
                "in the uk , the government has committed to hold a vote on the final deal in parliament as soon as possible after the negotiations have concluded .", 
                "this vote will take the form of a resolution in both houses of parliament and will cover both the withdrawal agreement and the terms for our future relationship .", 
                "the government will not implement any parts of the withdrawal agreement - for example by using clause 9 of the european union ( withdrawal ) bill - until after this vote has taken place .", 
                "but it is not clear yet whether or not this will be enough to buy off some of the potential rebels .", 
                "in an interview on sky news within the last hour grieve said he did not see why , if ministers are serious about not wanting to use clause 9 powers until mps have approved the withdrawal agreement , they could not just accept his amendment .",
