                "nicola sturgeon , scotland 's first minister , said she was publishing a brexit impact report in the hope of boosting the prospects of getting the uk to stay in the single market .", 
                "she described the document ( pdf ) as more detailed and extensive than anything so far provided by the uk government '' and said that it showed clearly that , if the uk has to leave the eu , staying in the single market was the least damaging option by far '' .", 
                "it was absolutely , manifestly , beyond any doubt the option that will do the least damage to our economy '' , she said .", 
                "the report focuses on the impact of brexit on the scottish economy , but it says explicitly ( in paragraph 13 ) that it has implications for the debate in the uk generally .", 
                "sturgeon said : with the next phase of the talks to determine the future relationship between eu and the uk due to begin in the next few weeks , it is time now to make that case for continued membership of the single market even more loudly than before .", 
                "today we do exactly that backed by new evidence of the importance of single market membership to our economic and social prospects .", 
                "she said she believed that there was a majority in favour of staying in the single market in the house of commons .", 
                "she was referring to where she think mps stand on this as individuals .", 
                "as she conceded , labour 's official stance on the single market ( see next paragraph ) is preventing that majority she claims exists being mobilised .", 
                "she implied that jeremy corbyn was trying to mislead people by claiming that the uk could not leave the eu and remain in the single market .", 
                "she said this as she conceded that getting corbyn to shift his stance on the single market was crucial .", 
                "the bigger issue , in order to get to that majority , is to get jeremy corbyn off the ridiculous position he is in .", 
                "either jeremy corbyn is still misunderstanding the position of the single market , which given how often it has been pointed out to him ca n't possibly be the case .", 
                "or he is now trying to deliberately mislead people with this line that you can not be in the single market if you are not in the eu .", 
                "norway stands as the living proof that that is just not the case .", 
                "the scottish government report said scotland 's gdp would be 8.5 % lower by 2030 than it would be if it stayed in the eu if brexit resulted in the uk trading with europe on wto terms .", 
                "it would be 6.1 % lower with a free trade agreement , but only 2.7 % lower if the uk stayed in the single market , the report said .", 
                "the report also translated these figures into gdp per capita terms - a tactic that george osborne also tried when he published a treasury report on the impact of brexit before the referendum .", 
                "osborne 's tactic is generally seen to have been a failure , partly because the figures he used seemed too precise to be plausible for a long-term forecast and partly because implying that gdp per capita was the same as household income was seen as misleading .", 
                "brexit impact analysis government the report said real disposable income would be almost 10 % lower by 2030 under the hardest form of brexit than it would be if the uk stayed in the eu .", 
                "under a free trade agreement it would be 7.4 % lower , the report said , and it would be just 1.4 % lower if the uk stayed in the single market .", 
                "this measure was not one included in the treasury forecast in 2016 .", 
                "the report said staying in the single market was advantageous not just because barriers to trade would be lower but because the benefits of the single market have not yet been fully realised .", 
                "it said : it is clear that the benefits we have derived from almost 45 years of membership of the single market are far from exhausted .", 
                "although substantial progress has been achieved in the years since the european single market programme was launched in 1992 , it remains incomplete in key areas .", 
                "removing the remaining barriers to trade in goods and services will unlock further gains for commerce , consumers and workers across the eu .", 
                "this is particularly true as the eu moves to complete an energy union , a capital markets union , a banking union and a digital single market .", 
                "furthermore , considerable potential remains untapped due to remaining barriers to cross-border trade in goods and services .", 
                "sturgeon said she had to campaign to keep free movement because restricting eu migration would be bad for the scottish economy .", 
                "the report said : scotland 's economy benefits significantly from eu migration .", 
                "eu citizens are helping to grow our economy , address skills shortages within key sectors and make an essential contribution to our population growth .", 
                "over the last decade population growth has been the primary driver of gdp growth and this has been driven chiefly by inward migration .", 
                "the scottish government recently undertook modelling of the economic contribution of eu citizens to the scottish economy which confirms that workers from other eu countries bring real economic benefits to scotland .", 
                "and in her speech sturgeon said : over the next 25 years our own projected birthrate will not be sufficient to grow our population .", 
                "in the period to 2041 , all our projected population growth will come from inward migration .", 
                "without that our population could go into decline and with it our ability to grow our economy and fund our public services .", 
                "that would be the stark reality for scotland of a restriction in our ability to attract people to our country .", 
                "that is why , as first minister , i have a duty to make the case for free movement , no matter how difficult that is sometimes perceived to be .",

                "it said : the damage will not only be economic , serious as this is , but will also compromise current safeguards in a range of vital policy areas currently driven at the eu level such as rights and protections in areas like the environment , workers ' rights and justice and home affairs co-operation where we derive considerable benefit .",

                "she told the programme : for me , the bar we need to set on aid spending is not just 'are we spending this money well ' but 'could we spend it better in the national interest ' and i think we do need to address that issue head on .", 
                "mordaunt was expanding on ideas she set out in an article in today 's daily telegraph ( paywall ) .", 
                "in it , she set out out what she describes as five aid pledges .", 
                "here is my summary of them .", 
                "( her article put them in a different order . )", 
                "1 - mordaunt said the uk would no longer pay for aid projects developing countries could fund themselves .", 
                "i will not invest when others should be putting their hands in their pockets .", 
                "it will no longer be enough for a project simply to be achieving good things .", 
                "we must be able to demonstrate why it absolutely needs to be britain that pays for them - rather than other donors , the private sector or , where it can , the government of the country itself .", 
                "i want the governments of developing countries to take responsibility for investing in healthcare or education .", 
                "if it chooses not to , that will inform our decisions .", 
                "2 - she said spending by other departments would contribute to the aid target .", 
                "as more government departments make investments in overseas development , i will find new ways to help other departments make their spend more effective .", 
                "this provides further means for us to invest and does not increase the uk 's deficit .", 
                "and it also counts towards our 0.7 per cent of gdp aid spending target .", 
                "3 - she said she would focus aid spending more on issues that matter most to the british people '' .", 
                "i will ensure that our aid spend directly contributes to tackling the issues that matter most to the british people .", 
                "we are already doing this in some areas .", 
                "for example , dfid 's research on global health has already helped protect our nation from the risk of global pandemics , and developed new diagnostic tests that are also being used by the nhs .", 
                "but we will go much further .", 
                "you will soon see the fruits of work between dfid and defra to tackle plastics polluting the oceans and to prevent the illegal wildlife trade , both issues the british public care about passionately .", 
                "( this does sound a bit like a proposal to start spending money on saving dolphins instead of the world 's poor , but doubtless mordaunt would object to that characterisation . )", 
                "4 - she said she would use aid to assist brexit .", 
                "i will develop alongside the department for international trade a bold new brexit-ready proposition to boost trade and investment with developing countries and promote sustainable economic development and job creation .", 
                "development policy will not exist in a vacuum .", 
                "it will be part of a joined-up response to the challenges and opportunities we face as a country .", 
                "5 - she said she would cut funding to organisations that do not deliver on the targets they are set .",
