                "in his opening remarks he said : the uk decided to leave the european union .",

                "but one thing is clear : the single market , the eu capacity to regulate , to supervise , to enforce our laws , must not and will not be undermined by brexit .", 
                "the uk strongly contributed to the development of our single market which is the foundation of the eu .", 
                "it understands well , very well , how it works .", 
                "the european council guidelines state that the union will preserve its autonomy of decision-making .",

                "this is simply impossible .",

                "he repeated the point during the q & a , accusing the british government of nostalgia '' .", 
                "he said : when i read some of the papers that david has sent me on behalf of the british government , in some proposals i see a sort of nostalgia in the form of specific requests which would amount to continuing to enjoy the benefits of the single market and eu membership without actually being part of it .", 
                "maybe i 've got the wrong end of the stick .", 
                "maybe there is no nostaglia .",

                "leaving the single market means leaving the single market .", 
                "if that is what has been decided , there will be consequences .", 
                "david davis , the brexit secretary , responded to this point by saying it was wrong to mistake belief in the free market for nostalgia .", 
                "barnier said there was no decisive progress '' on the key issue in this week 's talks .", 
                "we did not get any decisive progress on any of the principal subjects .", 
                "barnier strongly hinted that , given the current rate of progress , he would not be advising eu leaders to let the talks move on to phase two in october .", 
                "currently the talks focus on withdrawal issues , but the uk wants the talks to move to phase two , covering the future trade relationship , as soon as possible .", 
                "the eu says it will agree this when sufficient progress has been made on withdrawal issues ( citizens ' rights , ireland and the brexit bill '' ) and it had been hoped that this would happen in october .", 
                "barnier said : at the current state of progress we are quite far from being able to say that sufficient progress has taken place , sufficient for me to be able to recommend to the european council that it engage in discussions on the future relationship between the uk and eu at the same time as we would , during the course of 2018 , go on working on finalising the exit and withdrawal agreement .", 
                "barnier claimed that this week 's talks showed that the uk did not feel legally obliged to honour its legal finacial obligations after brexit .", 
                "in his opening remarks he said : eu taxpayers should not pay at 27 for the obligations undertaken at 28 .", 
                "this would not be fair .", 
                "in july , the uk recognised that it has obligations beyond the brexit date .", 
                "but this week the uk explained that these obligations will be limited to their last payment to the eu budget before departure .", 
                "yet we have joint obligations towards third countries .", 
                "for example : we have guaranteed long-term loans to ukraine , together .", 
                "we jointly support development in africa , the caribbean and pacific countries through the european development fund .", 
                "after this week , it is clear that the uk does not feel legally obliged to honour these obligations after departure .", 
                "we have also jointly committed to support innovative enterprises and green infrastructure in european regions until 2020 .", 
                "these are not recognised by the uk as legal obligations .", 
                "with such uncertainty , how can we build trust and start discussing a future relationship ?", 
                "davis said the uk had a very different legal stance '' on the issue of financial obligations .", 
                "and , although the uk would pay what it owed , the government had an obligation to taxpayers to challenge what the eu was demanding , he said .", 
                "the commission has set out its position and we have a duty to our taxpayers to interrogate it rigorously .", 
                "at this round we presented our legal analysis , on on-budget issues , on off-budget issues , and on the eib - european investment bank .", 
                "it 's fair to say across the piece we have a very different legal stance , but as we said in the article 50 letter the settlement should be in accordance with law and in the spirit of the uk 's continuing partnership with the eu .", 
                "davis also said , during the q & a , that britain was a country that met its obligations but that those obligations have got to be well specified , they 've got to be real . ''", 
                "davis also said the uk would acknowledge its moral obligations , as well as its legal obligations , when agreeing what to pay the eu .", 
                "talking about the obligations the uk would meet , he said : they do n't necessarily have to be legal .", 
                "we also recognise moral obligations sometimes .", 
                "barnier said he was willing to speed up the pace of talks if necessary .", 
                "he said : time is flying , it is passing very quickly , if we need to , we on our side , on behalf of the 27 , are prepared on behalf of the eu institutions to step up and intensify the rhythm of the negotiations .", 
                "davis claimed that some concrete progress '' had been made this week .", 
                "this week we have had long and detailed discussions across multiple areas and i think it 's fair to say we have seen some concrete progress , and michel referred to one but there 's more than that .", 
                "davis said that both sides had reached agreement in some new areas relating to citizens ' rights .", 
                "in his opening speech he said : this week we have discussed a wide range of issues which will have a significant impact on people 's lives .", 
                "in particular , both sides have agreed : to protect the rights of frontier workers .", 
                "to cover future social security contributions for those covered by the withdrawal agreement .", 
                "that we should at least protect existing healthcare rights and arrangements for eu27 citizens in the uk and uk nationals in the eu .", 
                "the ehic [ european health insurance card ] arrangements .", 
                "that is good news for example , for british pensioners in the eu : it means that they will continue to have their health care arrangements protected both where they live and - when they travel to another member state - to be able to use an ehic card .", 
                "on economic rights , we have secured the right of british citizens in the eu27 to set up and manage a business within their member state of residence , and of course visa versa .", 
                "on mutual recognition of qualifications , we have made progress in protecting the recognition of qualifications for british citizens resident in the eu27 and eu27 citizens in the uk .", 
                "for every one of these , of course , in fact every single thing i 've said , all of these are reciprocal , they work for brits in the eu and the eu27 in the uk .", 
                "davis claimed that the uk was being more flexible and pragmatic '' than the eu .", 
                "our discussions this week have exposed yet again that the uk 's approach is substantially more flexible and pragmatic than that of the eu , as it avoids unnecessary disruption for businesses and consumers .", 
                "barnier said that the home office decision to send letters ( mistakenly ) to 100 eu nationals threatening them with deportation highlighted the case for the european court of justice having a role protecting the rights of eu citizens after brexit .", 
                "this is something brussels is demanding but the uk is resisting .", 
                "barnier said in his opening remarks : over the summer , around one hundred eu and eea citizens living lawfully in the uk received deportation letters .",

                "but this is not the first time that something like this has happened .",

                "barnier urged people not to underestimate the important of the european parliament in the brexit process .",
