                "cable accused boris johnson and others of promoting a juvenile caricature of the single market and failing to understand how it really works .", 
                "the juvenile caricatures flowing from the pens of nigel farage , boris johnson and others the straight bananas , square strawberries and smaller condoms are n't just silly and fabricated ; they miss the essential point that the single market reduces administrative barriers to trade .", 
                "any manufacturer knows that it is costly and inefficient to reproduce 28 versions of the same widget .", 
                "i saw the process of integration at work as secretary of state .", 
                "when i talked to siemens about their new investment making turbines for offshore wind in hull they saw themselves as a european company operating within the single market .", 
                "when i talked to car companies about where they would build their next model- nissan , general motors/vauxhall , bmw/mini , jlr or ford making engines-a critical concern was their ability to be able to trade freely within the single market on common technical standards .", 
                "he said small businesses benefit from the single market , even if they do not directly export to the eu , because they supply big companies that do .", 
                "he said the single market was also important to people working in services .", 
                "you might respond that trade in cars and aerospace is all well and good , but our economy is 80 % services .", 
                "the are however very porous boundaries between manufacturing and services .", 
                "crucial to the success of manufacturing is good software , design , advertising and other creative industries .", 
                "the eu helps these industries by eliminating non-tariff barriers .", 
                "so it means an engineer or an architect can get off the plane in munich or madrid the next stage of development of the single market aims to bring down the remaining barriers to trade in services , energy and digital .", 
                "he insisted that red tape was not much of a problem for british business .", 
                "we are sometimes told by the brexiteers that if we left the eu we could have a bonfire of eu red tape .", 
                "but there is n't much left to burn .", 
                "the evidence suggests that britain has some of the least regulated product and labour markets in the world .",
