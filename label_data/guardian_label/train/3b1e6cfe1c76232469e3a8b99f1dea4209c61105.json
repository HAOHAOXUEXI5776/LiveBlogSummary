                "but crucially for mackay and nicola sturgeon , the deal will help relieve intense pressure on the scottish budget which will be unveiled on 14 december and reduce the need for sturgeon to call for higher taxes .",

                "excluding health the cut for the rest of public services is over 6 % - to keep this spending constant in per capita terms spending would need to be \u00a3 13 billion higher in 2022-23 than currently planned .",

                "there will almost inevitably be more such top ups in the years ahead .", 
                "he said public sector workers should not expect an above-inflation pay rise on the basis of the budget plans .", 
                "while the public pay cap has been lifted no additional money has yet been allocated and the treasury is committed to providing extra money only for nurses .", 
                "given the spending constraints , other public sector workers should not be holding their breath in anticipation of an inflation busting , or perhaps even 1 % busting , pay rise .",

                "the sorts of modest growth rates currently expected imply that , if we were to maintain the deficit at the just over 1 % of national income projected for the early 2020s , it would take us until well past 2060s for debt to fall to its pre-crisis levels of 40 % of national income .",

                "it 's important to think clearly here .", 
                "that fall up to now is not because young people are living nowhere , it 's because they are renting from older people who have bought properties to rent out because that provides a good return .", 
                "older , richer people might continue to buy these new properties .", 
                "they will stop doing so only when they take the view that the return in terms of rent and capital gain is not worth their while - the consumption value of housing needs to rise relative to its investment value .", 
                "that 's how the actuality and promise of more house building can tip the scales in favour of younger buyers .", 
                "he said even though the stamp duty cut would increase prices , first-time buyers would still benefit .", 
                "it 's also important to think clearly about the impact of stamp duty .", 
                "the obr has said that the price faced by first time buyers might rise twice as much as the saving in stamp duty .", 
                "stamp duty cuts do lead to price rises .", 
                "the price rise can be bigger than the duty cut in part because properties are transacted multiple times and in part because of the leverage effect - if i pay \u00a3 1 less in stamp duty i can put down \u00a3 1 more deposit , meaning i can obtain a larger mortgage .", 
                "so the \u00a3 1 cut allows me to spend more than \u00a3 1 more on a house .",
