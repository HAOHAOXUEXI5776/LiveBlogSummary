                "now , if our nation does vote to leave tomorrow , we must respect their decision .", 
                "but if they vote to leave on the basis of half-truths and untruths and misunderstandings , then pretty soon the gravediggers of our prosperity will have some very serious questions to answer .",

                "but that will be of no consolation .",

                "that is not how our island story should go .", 
                "he praised david cameron for the way he has conducted the campaign , and implied that some of cameron 's tory opponents had been too abusive towards him .",

                "and i think the way in which he has conducted himself in putting the country before self and the country before party is quite remarkable .",

                "and to try and solve a short-term problem that will diminish as the european economy begins to grow again , and leave europe and risk a far greater longterm impact to our prosperity in the world is quite disproportionate to the problem that we face .",

                "they will lose one of only two nations that have a military capability of significance and a nuclear capacity .",
