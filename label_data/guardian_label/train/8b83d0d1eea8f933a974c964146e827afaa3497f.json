                "on top of that , markets were buoyed by a rise in crude as the international energy agency said the oil price might have bottomed out and hopes grew that producers would come to an agreement to freeze output .", 
                "brent is currently up 0.9 % at $ 40.41 .",

                "the final scores showed : the ftse 100 finished up 1.7 % or 103.09 points at 6139.79 , albeit down 0.99 % on the week , its first weekly fall since the middle of february germany 's dax jumped 3.5 % to 9831.13 france 's cac closed 3.2 % higher at 4492.79 italy 's ftse mib soared 4.8 % to 18,987.73 spain 's ibex ended up 3.69 % at 9090.6 in greece , the athens market added 0.37 % to 566.20 on wall street , the dow jones industrial average is currently 217 points or 1.2 % higher .",
