                "here are the main points from theresa may 's press conference with angela merkel .", 
                "angela merkel signalled that germany would be happy to let the uk wait until it triggers article 50 , starting the formal eu withdrawal process .", 
                "theresa may has said this will not happen before the end of the year , and merkel seemed to accept this , saying it was sensible for britain to decide what it wanted first .", 
                "merkel said : from my point of view it 's completely understandable that a few days after the referendum , a few days after a new government in great britain is formed , that the government has to first think what are our interests , what exactly do they look like and i think it 's in all of our interests if great britain has a very well defined negotiating position [ when talks start . ]", 
                "merkel also said it was absolutely necessary to have a certain period of time to prepare for brexit .", 
                "that 's what 's in the treaty .", 
                "we have to wait [ for article 50 to be triggered ] to have an idea how the uk envisages leaving , envisages the future relationship .", 
                "no one wants things to be up in the air .", 
                "i do n't think the british citizens want that , nor do the european member states want that .", 
                "but we all have an interest in this matter being carefully prepared , in positions being clearly defined and delineated .", 
                "and i think it is absolutely necessary to have a certain period of time to prepare for it .", 
                "may also said that she did not want to rush the process .", 
                "she said : all of us will need time to prepare for these negotiations and the united kingdom will not invoke article 50 until our objectives are clear .", 
                "that is why i have said already that this will not happen before the end of this year .", 
                "i understand this timescale will not please everyone but i think it is important to provide clarity on that now .", 
                "we should strive for a solution which respects the decision of british voters , but also respects the interests of our european partners .", 
                "may was asked to justify her decision to appoint boris johnson as foreign secretary .", 
                "a german journalist asked her to explain why johnson was made foreign secretary given that he was someone who does n't really want to play the game .", 
                "may sidestepped the question , saying she had appointed a team of ministers who will take forward the position of the british government .", 
                "merkel said that , whoever was foreign secretary , the country is an experienced country when it comes to diplomacy and diplomatic expertise ( implying johnson 's appointment did not matter too much , because foreign office diplomats are good ) .", 
                "this came only a day after johnson was repeatedly asked about his outright lies and past insults to foreign leaders by american reporters at a press conference in london .", 
                "on this basis it seems fair to describe his appointment as a national embarrassment .", 
                "may sidestepped a question about whether she would be willing to sacrifice trade in order to secure control of immigration .", 
                "the reuters report puts this well .", 
                "may said it was clear the british people wanted more control over immigration , but underlined that good trade was vital for the economy , offering little insight into her stance on the thorniest part of future talks .", 
                "it 's very clear to me that one of the messages that the british gave in their vote that the uk should leave the european union is they wanted control brought into movement of people from the european union and so that of course will be one of the issues we will be looking at and we as a government will deliver on for people , may told a news conference .", 
                "may gave a clearer answer on this in the q & a after her speech on monday last week , only a few minutes before andrea leadsom dropped out of the leadership contest , paving the way for her to become prime minister .", 
                "may hinted that stopping free movement would take priority over retaining single market membership .", 
                "may said that britain would not walk away from its european friends after brexit .", 
                "she said i have been clear that brexit means brexit and the united kingdom is going to make a success of it .", 
                "but i also want to be clear here today , and across europe in the weeks ahead , that we are not walking away from our european friends .", 
                "britain will remain an outward-looking country and germany will remain a vital partner and a special friend for us the nature of our relationship is going to change as the uk leaves the eu , but we both want to maintain the closest possible economic relationship between our countries .", 
                "may said she wanted to get net migration down to sustainable levels and that this meant getting it into the tens of thousands .", 
                "may described herself and merkel as women who wanted to get on with the job .", 
                "merkel agreed .", 
                "that 's all from me for today .",

                "i do n't think he 's a leader in parliament , but i do think he 's got a lot to say for labour .", 
                "i would absolutely want him to take a role like president , or chairman , as we have had in the past jeremy has a way of communicating that many of our members find very appealing .",

                "he said that he was standing against corbyn because , although corbyn had been good at identifying the problems facing britain , he was not good at proposing solutions .",
