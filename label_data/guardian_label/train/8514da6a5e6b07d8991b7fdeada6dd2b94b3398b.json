                "here are the main points from david davis 's evidence to the commons brexit committee .", 
                "davis , the brexit secretary , said that parliament might not get to vote on brexit deal until after the uk has left the eu .", 
                "he said that he expected there to be a withdrawal agreement and a new trade agreement but that the two of them might be finalised at the same time , at the end of march 2019 .", 
                "there was a history of eu negotiations being settled at the 59th minute of the 11th hour , he said .", 
                "it 's no secret that the way the union makes its decision tends to be at the 59th minute of the 11th hour of the 11th day and so on , and that is precisely what i would expect to happen if there is a time limit on a negotiation the union stops the clock , it assumes that it 's still at 11:59 until it is concluded , sometimes over the course of 24 , 36 , 72 hours thereafter and that 's what i imagine it will be .", 
                "and it will be a lot of pressure , very high stress , very exciting for everybody watching .", 
                "when labour 's seema malhotra asked if this meant that the parliamentary vote on the deal could come after brexit has taken place , davis replied : it could be , yeah .", 
                "it depends when it concludes .", 
                "malhotra then asked for clarification .", 
                "so the vote could be after march 2019 ?", 
                "davis replied : it could be it ca n't come before we have the deal .", 
                "davis also said that he would not mind if the trade deal , which will have to be ratified eu national parliaments , gets ratified after brexit during the transition .", 
                "he said : my concern is that we get the deal with the council , with the commission by the 29th .", 
                "i would not be mortified if the ratification process ran into the implementation period .", 
                "davis said he a trade deal with the eu could be agreed within 12 months , and certainly before march 2019 .", 
                "( see 9.32am . )", 
                "this contradicts michel barnier , the eu 's chief brexit negotiator , who thinks it will take much longer .", 
                "davis said that he expected the form of the implementation period to be agreed before the end of march next year .", 
                "but it would probably not happen before the end of 2017 because the eu summit , where eu leaders may agree to open talks on a transition , takes place just before christmas , he said .", 
                "but he also said theresa may was right to tell mps on monday that the transition deal would only be finalised as part of the overall , final agreement .", 
                "he said there was a danger of the eu trying to impose \u0080\u0098sudden , last-minute ' conditions in brexit talks .", 
                "( see 9.43am . )", 
                "he said that eu would require a higher price if the uk wanted the transition to last longer than two years .", 
                "( see 9.46am . )", 
                "he accepted that that the economic benefits of a trade deal with the eu could outweigh the cost of extra payments equivalent to roughly 1 % of gdp .",
