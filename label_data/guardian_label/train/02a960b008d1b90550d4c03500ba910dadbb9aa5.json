            "text": [
                "here are the main points from theresa may 's commons statement .", 
                "theresa may repeatedly told mps that she does not intended to water down workers ' rights after brexit , but failed to satisfy opposition mps that the working time directive is safe .", 
                "their questions were triggered by reports in the sunday times and the sun on sunday saying some tories want to tear up the working time directive after brexit .", 
                "may responded to the many questions with similar answers , just stressing her commitment to workers ' rights in general terms .", 
                "for example , when labour 's chuka umunna asked her to guarantee that post brexit none of the working time regulations , importantly the 48-hour working week , will be done away with by her government , she replied : under the eu withdrawal bill we are bringing these rights into uk law .", 
                "i have said that we will maintain workers ' rights , and indeed enhance workers ' rights .", 
                "later umunna and other mps said they were not satisfied by the assurances they had had .", 
                "( see 4.46pm . )", 
                "their doubts are heightened by the claim in the sun on sunday that getting rid of eu rules on maximum working hours would enhance rights , not undermine them .", 
                "some tory brexiters expressed doubts about may 's negotiation .", 
                "the strongest criticism came from jacob rees-mogg and peter bone .", 
                "rees-mogg attacked the eu 's new negotiating guidelines , saying paragraph 4 , saying the uk would continue to bound by eu law during the transition , would make the united kingdom in the transition phase no more than a vassal state , a colony , a serf of the european union .", 
                "rees-mogg urged may to copy margaret thatcher and show mettle and steel in rejecting these rather hostile negotiating terms from the european union .", 
                "bone said the uk should refuse to pay the \u00e2\u00a3 39bn offered to the eu .", 
                "the government has agreed to pay the \u00e2\u00a3 39bn , and does accept that it will be bound by eu law during the transition , but may managed to gloss over these points in her replies , and it did not feel as if rees-mogg and bone were escalating hostilities .", 
                "other tory mps demanded assurances that brexit would actually happen on 29 march 2019 and that the eu payments would be conditional on a final deal being negotiated .", 
                "( they will be , but the relevant final deal will be the withdrawal deal - not the trade deal , which will come later . )", 
                "for all the reservations , generally may 's mps were supportive .", 
                "may condemned the abuse of mps for their stance on brexit - but refused repeated invitations to criticise the daily mail in particular for its coverage of the tory rebels who voted against the government on wednesday .", 
                "in her opening statement may said : we are dealing with questions of great significance to our country 's future , so it is natural that there are many strongly held views on all sides of this chamber .", 
                "and it is right and proper that we should debate them - and do so with all the passion and conviction that makes our democracy what it is .", 
                "but there can never be a place for the threats of violence and intimidation against some members that we have seen in recent days .", 
                "jeremy corbyn accused the mail of whipping up hatred against the rebel tory mps .", 
                "he and other labour mps challenged may to condemn the mail , but she dodged these questions .", 
                "may claimed the uk would be outside the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy after brexit .", 
                "asked about these programmes , she said : we will be leaving the european union on march 29 2019 , we will therefore be leaving the common fisheries policy and the common agricultural policy at that date .", 
                "the relationship we have on both those issues continuing through the implementation period with the european union will be part of the negotiation of that period which will start very soon .", 
                "but , given that may also says the uk will be leaving the single market and the customs union during the transition despite the fact that for all practical purposes it will be staying in both , may 's comment is probably more of a linguistic tic than a statement of policy .", 
                "that 's all from me for today .", 
                "thanks for the comments ."

                "de rynck said businesses would only get absolute certainty about the brexit transition when the withdrawal agreement is finalised , probably in october 2018 .", 
                "asked when business would get certainty , he replied : on businesses and when the certainty comes , it only comes indeed when the transition , which is part of the article 50 deal , will be ratified .",

                "( see 12.40pm . )", 
                "he said the uk would have to accept any new eu rules coming into force during the transition .", 
                "( see 12.22pm . )", 
                "he said the eu would not give the uk access to the single market for just some sectors of the economy .", 
                "he said : to come back to the mathematics of pluses and minuses , what you can not do is square an fta [ free trade agreement ] circle into a single market .",

                "there can be no sector-by-sector participation in the single market .", 
                "and trying to square the fta in a way that would lead to sector-based participation in the single market would for the eu be the beginning of the end of the correct functioning of the integrity of the single market .", 
                "and that 's therefore something the eu will want to avoid .",

                "( see 9.16am . )",

                "when he spoke about the uk getting a bespoke trade deal , he was just making the point that it would not be literally the same as canada 's .", 
                "he said the eu would never see brexit as a success .", 
                "for us , i do n't think we will ever label brexit a success .", 
                "i think it 's a mutual weakening of two parties .",
