                "an interest rate hike in the uk is moving closer '' , the governor of the bank of england told mps in comments that have fanned market expectations that policymakers could start to tighten borrowing costs before the end of the year .", 
                "theresa may , the home secretary , has told mps that a secure zone is to be set up in calais to protect lorries from migrants trying to climb on board to enter britain illegally .",

                "cameron has accused critics of a huge trade deal with the us of inventing false scare stories that we will all be force-fed chlorinated chickens '' in a bid to scupper the crucial '' agreement .", 
                "as the press association reports , urging business chiefs to help make the case , he conceded that the agreement faced a big fight '' to overcome sustained attacks from left-wing opponents and warned britain would rue the day if we miss this opportunity '' to open up transatlantic markets .", 
                "speaking at the times ceo summit , he said : i am hugely positive about it but i think we have a big fight to win because the left across europe is mobilising , often through ngos , to try to find all sorts of reasons why this is a bad idea .",

                "his ardent labourphilia , which works will when he deploys it at normal hustings event , was never going go to down well with a room full of journalists , and wisely he did n't try it today .", 
                "the questions were n't especially hostile , but burnham has received some grotesquely negative coverage in the sun ( they seem to be waging a vendetta against him over hillsborough ) , and he was non-committal when asked if he would give them an interview .",

                "specifically , he said that the party should tabled a reasoned amendment , explaining what it disliked about the bill , and then only vote against if the reasoned amendment fails ( but that amounts to the same thing , because a reasoned amendment is one saying why a bill should not get a second reading ) .", 
                "explaining his opposition to the bill , he said : the welfare reform and work bill is unsupportable because it does n't do what it says on the tin - support work .", 
                "in fact , it does the opposite .", 
                "it diminishes work incentives with its changes to tax credits and the esa .",

                "the bill abolishes the measurements around child poverty and at the same time has measures that will push children into poverty .",

                "this is what he said when asked about it .", 
                "i will make my decisions at the point where the party has its agreed position , but as you will know i am somebody who supports the collective line of the party , and i 've made my views in the proper way in shadow cabinet .",

                "he said : i said i would not get back into a situation where the labour party , and the leader of the labour party , is going on bended knee to certain newspapers , trying to court newspapers , because i think in the end that gets you into difficulty .", 
                "and it got us to the point where a whole city was crying injustice throughout our time in government and we were n't listening .", 
                "asked if he was saying that a hillsborough inquiry would have taken place sooner if it had not been for labour 's relationship with newspapers , he replied : i am saying that it seems there was a decision to leave it alone .", 
                "i do n't know all of the background to the decision-making , but in 1998 , after the stuart-smith inquiry , a decision was taken to draw a line under it and to leave it in that position , [ i was told ] i was better not to carry on looking into it .",

                "and it is hillsborough-related .",

                "a week ago , when mps last debated evel ( it 's becoming a weekly occurrence ) , it was clear that david cameron was facing a significant backlash from backbenchers .", 
                "the threat of a revolt was so serious that ministers had to put off the vote until the autumn .", 
                "but now , in the light of the snp decision , which could see scottish mps having a decisive impact on an england-only matter , the tory evel rebellion may well evaporate .", 
                "here are some examples of what conservative mps have been saying .", 
                "from sir peter bottomley the scottish national party risk making themselves look foolish , unprincipled and unwise by voting against making english law similar to scottish law .", 
                "this action is naive - it makes them look silly and is perhaps the first major mis-step by nicola sturgeon .", 
                "from nick boles nick boles ( @ nickbolesmp ) whatever your views on hunting it 's surely a bit rich of snp to vote to deny england a law that scotland already has .", 
                "time for evel methinks from nick de bois nick de bois ( @ nickdebois ) fox hunting vote tomorrow is set to become more about english votes 4 english laws than hunting as snp wade in to vote on an english matter from grant shapps grant shapps ( @ grantshapps ) now i 'm no fan of fox hunting , but snp preparing to vote on this english & wales only issue shows why english votes for english laws needed !", 
                "nicola sturgeon must know that the snp 's decision to vote on hunting will only increase the chances of the conservatives pushing their evel measures through the commons .", 
                "david cameron claims boosting the voting rights of english mps could strengthen the union , but sturgeon has said it will have the opposite effect and her analysis seems more plausible than the prime minister 's ( not least because she is in a position to make it self-fulfilling ) .", 
                "overall , as the labour mp chris bryant says ( conveniently forgetting that labour collaborated with the snp on this - see 9.32am ) this is an episode that leaves the union looking even more creaky than it did 24 hours ago .", 
                "chris bryant mp ( @ rhonddabryant ) seems tory mps and snp on mutually assured course to dismantle the union .",
