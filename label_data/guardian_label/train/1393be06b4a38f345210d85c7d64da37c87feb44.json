                "kenneth clarke 's speech was superb , but the two opening speeches , from david davis , the brexit secretary , and sir keir starmer , his labour opposite number , were underwhelming .", 
                "neither of them had anything particularly revealing to announce , and the passion in what they had to say was a bit muted .", 
                "perhaps the debate will liven up more as it goes along .", 
                "here are the key points from the opening speeches .", 
                "starmer said labour wanted the government to guarantee the rights of eu nationals living in the uk now , unilaterally , because attempts to reach a deal on this with other eu countries have so far failed .", 
                "the government wants a deal that will guarantee the rights of eu nationals living in the uk as well as those of britons living on the continent .", 
                "but , starmer , told mps : that has not worked and now the prime minister should act unilaterally to give assurance to those eu nationals living in this country .", 
                "davis said the government might seek to retain some link with euratom , the european body that regulates the civil nuclear industry .", 
                "the government 's explanatory notes to the article 50 bill make it clear that leaving the eu also means leaving euratom .", 
                "in the debate labour 's john woodcock said this could put thousands of jobs at a new nuclear power station in cumbria at risk .", 
                "he asked davis to keep an open mind on staying in euratom , telling him : there is a danger that there will be years of uncertainty that could put at risk the 21,000 new jobs which are slated to come as part of the moorside development [ in cumbria ] , as well as many others across the uk .", 
                "davis said he understood woodcock 's point .", 
                "and he hinted that the uk could remain linked to euratom .", 
                "he said : if it is not possible to come to a conclusion with some sort of relationship with euratom , then we will no doubt be able to do one with the international atomic energy authority , possibly the most respectable international body in the world .", 
                "starmer said labour wanted britain to stay in various eu agencies .", 
                "the ones he cited were the european aviation safety agency , the european medicines agency , europol or eurojust .", 
                "( see 1.24pm . )", 
                "starmer said this bill was very difficult '' for labour because so many labour mps wanted to stay in the eu .", 
                "but the party had to accept the result of the referendum , he said : we share values and identity with the eu .", 
                "but we failed to persuade , we lost the referendum .", 
                "yes , the result was close , yes , there were lies and half-truths - none worse than the false promise of 350 million a week to the nhs .", 
                "yes , technically the referendum is not legally binding but the result was not technical - it was deeply political .", 
                "and politically the notion that the referendum was merely a consultation exercise to inform parliament holds no water .", 
                "when i was imploring people up and down the country to vote in the referendum and vote to remain , i told them their vote really mattered , that a decision was going to be made .", 
                "i was not inviting them to express a view .", 
                "and although we 're fiercely internationalist , fiercely pro-european , we in the labour party are , above all , democrats .", 
                "kenneth clarke , the conservative former chancellor , said that he would vote against the bill and that he did not see why pro-europeans like himself should have to accept the result of the referendum .", 
                "he told mps : let me give an analogy in explaining the position for members of parliament after this referendum .", 
                "i have fought lord knows how many election over the past 50 years and i have always advocated voting conservative .", 
                "the british public in their wisdom have occasionally failed to take my advice and they have actually by a majority voted labour .", 
                "and i have found myself here facing a labour government .", 
                "i do not recall an occasion where i was told it was now my democratic duty to support labour policies under labour governments on the other side of the house .", 
                "that proposition would have been treated with ridicule and scorn .", 
                "clarke also mocked the idea that leaving the single market and the customs union would be good for the economy .", 
                "we are combining withdrawal from the single market and the customs union with this great new globalised future , which offers tremendous opportunities for us .", 
                "apparently you follow the rabbit down the hole and you emerge in a wonderland where suddenly countries around the world are queuing up to give us trading advantages and access to their markets that previously we had never been able to achieve as part of the european union .", 
                "nice men like president trump and president erdogan are just impatient to abandon their normal protectionism and give us access .", 
                "do n't let me be too cynical - i hope that is right .", 
                "i want the best outcome for the united kingdom from this process .",

                "clarke suggested enoch powell might be comfortable with the modern conservative party .", 
                "i feel the spirit of my former colleague - who i rather respected , apart from one or two extreme views - my former colleague enoch powell , the best speaker of the eurosceptic cause i 've probably ever heard in this house of commons .", 
                "if he was here he would probably find it amazing to believe that his party had become eurosceptic and rather mildly anti-immigrant in a strange way in 2016 , and i 'm afraid on that i have n't followed them and i do n't intend to do so .", 
                "davis said mps who voted against the bill would be defying the wishes of the people .", 
                "he told mps : the eyes of the nation are on this chamber as we consider this bill .", 
                "for many years there 's been a creeping sense in the country - and not just this country - that politicians say one thing and do another .", 
                "we voted to give the people the chance to determine our future at a referendum ; now we must honour our side of the agreement - to vote to deliver on the result .", 
                "so really we are considering that very simple question - do we trust the people or not ?",
