                "mark carney told mps last week that he was gloriously \u0080\u0098serene ' about the bank of england 's approach to britain 's brexit vote .", 
                "and today , the governor will be corralled with fellow policymakers on the monetary policy committee to discuss the state of the uk economy and decide if more stimulus measures are needed .", 
                "in truth , the bank is very unlikely to take any fresh measures today - just a month after slashing interest rates to record lows and extending its quantitative-easing bond-buying programme by \u00e2\u00a3 60bn .", 
                "but the minutes of today 's meeting , which will be released at midday , will show the bank 's thinking on brexit - and whether the mpc are split .", 
                "last month , three hawkish members of the committee rebelled against carney - voting against the \u00e2\u00a3 60bn qe boost .", 
                "might ian mccafferty and kristin forbes give the governor a hard time today ( martin weale has now left the mpc ) .", 
                "forbes and mccafferty might point to recent economic data that has showed little immediate damage from the brexit vote - and no sign of the recession which forecasters had predicted ( yet anyway ) .", 
                "analysts at rbc capital markets reckon the bank will sit tight today , as the dust settles following june 's referendum .", 
                "they say : no change in policy is expected this time and if the recent treasury select committee hearing on the august inflation report is anything to go by , there is n't likely to be much of an elaboration on the committee 's view about post-referendum economic performance .", 
                "we know the committee are cautious about placing too much weight on the survey indicators after the vote so it is clear they are taking a longer-term approach .", 
                "also coming up today here 's the economic calendar : 9.30am : the latest uk retail sales figures , for august 10am : eurozone inflation for august 12pm : bank of england interest rate decision & minutes 1.30pm : us retail sales figures , for august we 'll have an eye on greece today too , as talks continue with its lenders over its bailout programme ( and the slow pace of reforms ) .",
