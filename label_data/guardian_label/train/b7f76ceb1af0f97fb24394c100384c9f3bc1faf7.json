                "here are the main points from nick clegg 's interview .", 
                "this is a beefed-up version of the summary i filed earlier , and it includes a line from clegg 's interview with john pienaar on radio 5 live .", 
                "clegg said that the lib dems would propose tax rises for the wealthy going beyond the mansion tax .", 
                "further details would be unveiled before the election .", 
                "later party sources made it clear that he was talking about new tax increases , not just ideas that the lib dems have already floated , but which have not received much attention , such as their plan to cut pensions tax relief .", 
                "clegg said : [ lib dem plans to cut the deficit would involve ] a mixture of the following components : clamping down on tax evasion and tax avoidance , significant additional savings in whitehall .", 
                "there will need to be some additional savings but not nearly on the totally implausible scale that the conservatives have said in the welfare budget and then there will need to be some tax increases as well which fall on the wealthiest in society .", 
                "he said the broadcasters should come up with fresh proposals for the leaders ' debates .", 
                "last week he indicated that he was prepared to accept the plans already on the table .", 
                "he said pmqs should be scrapped .", 
                "talking on radio 5 live , he said : of course it 's ridiculous .", 
                "the whole thing should be scrapped .", 
                "it 's an absolute farce .", 
                "he said he would not join a coalition including ukip .", 
                "asked if he said he would serve in a cabinet with nigel farage , he said no .", 
                "and he came close to ruling out being in a coalition involving the snp .", 
                "asked if he would sit in a cabinet with them , he said he would find it very difficult to imagine the circumstances in which he could do that .", 
                "he said he did not accept predictions that the lib dems would lose half their seats at the election .", 
                "they would do better than the pundits expected , he said .", 
                "when told that the iain dale ( among others ) has predicted that the lib dems will lose half their seats , he said : iain dale will have to eat his words , because i really do n't think that 's going to happen .", 
                "he 's a good man but some of his predictions are getting a bit silly .", 
                "he said he supported giving more powers to the security services to protect national security as much as any chisel-faced securocrat .", 
                "but he reaffirmed his opposition to the communications data bill .", 
                "storing details of everyone 's internet use was unbritish , he said , because it involved treating everyone as guilty .", 
                "i 'm legislating now for new powers .", 
                "we did it in the summer , and new powers will need to be put on the statue book in the next parliament .", 
                "i will advocate them as much as any chisel-faced securocrat .", 
                "absolutely : i want to keep us safe .", 
                "it 's ludicrous , this idea that people who care about our freedom do n't care about our safety .", 
                "what i will not do , because it 's not proven , and many people , not just me , said it , was an overstretch that said every single man , woman and child across the whole country should have data about what they get up to online [ stored ] .", 
                "he said he wished coalition 's tuition fee system had been called a graduate tax because , in practice , that is what it was .", 
                "it would have saved the lib dems a lot of bother if they had used that label , he said .", 
                "if you really must know , what we 've actually introduced is a graduate tax .", 
                "i wish we 'd called it a graduate tax at the time which would have saved us a lot of heartache .", 
                "he said he was appalled by the treatment of the blogger in saudi arabia who is being lashed for mocking islam and that the government had protested strongly to the saudis about this .", 
                "he said labour and the conservatives wanted to airbrush out any other voices in british politics and return to business as usual between the red team and the blue team .", 
                "he said he was proud of the lib dem record .", 
                "i 'm a liberal democrat and i 'm incredibly proud of what we have one in this government .", 
                "we would n't have the recovery now if we had n't stepped up to the plate , we would n't have the tax cuts we have now benefiting millions of working people if it was n't for the liberal democrats , we would n't have the expansion of apprenticeships on the scale this country 's never seen , a fairer pension system , the pupil premium , the life-chances of the poorest kids in primary school improved in a way that has never happened before .", 
                "i 've taken the quotes from politicshome .", 
                "that 's all from me for today .",
