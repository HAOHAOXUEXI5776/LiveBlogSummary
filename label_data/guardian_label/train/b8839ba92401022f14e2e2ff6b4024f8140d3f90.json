                "the government 's schedule of year-on-year funding increases for the nhs in england , drawn up while david cameron was still prime minister , was due to run until 2020-21 .", 
                "that involves the question that has caused theresa may persistent political difficulty that is , whether the real amount of extra cash involved was the \u00e2\u00a3 8bn george osborne pledged in the 2015 election campaign or the \u00e2\u00a3 10bn figure may has used repeatedly , despite health thinktanks , the commons health select committee and nhs england chief executive simon stevens all saying that it is n't true .", 
                "so the conservatives had to come up with a lightly extended version of that plan some new numbers given the new parliament will sit until 2022 and that labour and the lib dems have pledged significant extra nhs funding .", 
                "may 's response is a pledge that we will increase nhs spending by a minimum of \u00e2\u00a3 8bn in real terms over the next five years , delivering an increase in real funding per head of the population for every year of the parliament .", 
                "but the manifesto provides no other detail .", 
                "it does n't say , for example , how much of the \u00e2\u00a3 8bn by 2022 is already included in the previous funding plan - ie , how much over and above what was already planned the nhs will get .", 
                "however , it does mean that may is ripping up the health budgetary plans she inherited from cameron/osborne by pledging , in effect , more money than planned in both next year and 2019-20 too .", 
                "those are the two years that - as stevens had publicly pointed out in parliament in january , to may 's likely discomfort were due to see per capita nhs spending fall , albeit by just 0.2 % in each year .", 
                "that was going to make transforming the way the nhs delivers care and making overdue improvements notably in cancer , mental health and maternity services - harder to achieve , stevens had warned .", 
                "so the \u00e2\u00a3 8bn is a victory , albeit modest , for his public pleas for more cash than the \u00e2\u00a3 8bn promised in 2015 .", 
                "but while \u00e2\u00a3 8bn is and sounds like a lot of money , in nhs terms it is small beer .", 
                "bear in mind that the nhs budget in england this year will be \u00e2\u00a3 123.7bn .", 
                "therefore \u00e2\u00a3 8bn more over five years is n't a lot of money .", 
                "it is well below the extra sums that labour ( \u00e2\u00a3 37bn over the parliament ) and lib dems ( \u00e2\u00a3 6bn a year , but for both the nhs and social care ) .", 
                "it is also far less than the minimum 4 % a year budget increases that the office for budget responsibility said last autumn the nhs would have to start receiving again after 2020 given the huge extra cost pressures that are due to come its way from the growing and even more rapidly-ageing population , increasing impact of lifestyle-related diseases such as diabetes and also patient and doctor demand to access new drugs and technology .", 
                "while 4 % is a hefty increase , that is the average annual budget increase that the nhs enjoyed between its creation in 1948 and 2010 , when the coalition took power ."
