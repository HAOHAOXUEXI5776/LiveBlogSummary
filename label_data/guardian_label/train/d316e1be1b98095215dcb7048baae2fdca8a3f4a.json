                "here 's the rationale for the dbrs downgrade , which has come ahead of the next scheduled rating announcement for greece from the agency on 12 june : the deviation of this review from the calendar is due to an increase in uncertainty over government policies and greece 's capacity to remain current on its debt .", 
                "dbrs placed the ratings under review on 4 february 2015 to reflect dbrs 's elevated concern over the potential for a deterioration in greece 's creditworthiness as a result of actions by the greek government following the general elections on 25 january 2015 .", 
                "in light of the change in government , and given the importance of financial assistance from the european commission , european central bank and international monetary fund , dbrs 's concern over greece 's ability to meet its financing needs had increased .", 
                "the current downgrade is due to a further increase in uncertainty over whether greece and its creditors will reach an agreement on a program that restores macroeconomic stability and improves greece 's cash position .", 
                "in the absence of an agreement , financing sources appear to be insufficient to meet greece 's financing needs over the foreseeable future .", 
                "this shortfall is due to the lack of access to bond markets , as well as a delay in an agreement between greece and its official sector creditors over the conditions that the creditors require in exchange for continuing the existing financial assistance program , or entering a new longer term lending program .", 
                "dbrs 's view is that a new longer term program is likely to be necessary to restore macroeconomic stabilization .", 
                "the delay in an agreement has had an adverse impact on the economic recovery , on financial stability , and on the fiscal stance .", 
                "the negative trend reflects the risk of a missed payment to official creditors , or the further buildup of arrears to domestic agents .", 
                "in the coming weeks greece faces a series of payments to the imf and the ecb .", 
                "dbrs 's view is that a default to these official sector creditors would likely cause an acceleration in the withdrawal of deposits from greek banks , and would further undermine growth prospects .", 
                "this is turn would make it more difficult for greece to generate primary fiscal surpluses .", 
                "such a default could also jeopardize ecb emergency liquidity assistance ( ela ) , without which greek banks could face lower liquidity buffers and run the risk of insolvency ."
