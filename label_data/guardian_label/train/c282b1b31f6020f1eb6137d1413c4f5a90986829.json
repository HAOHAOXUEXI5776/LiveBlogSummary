                "david simmonds , of the local government association 's asylum , refugee and migrant taskforce , told bbc radio 4 's today programme this morning that councils in england were taking 2,000 unaccompanied refugee children a year at a cost of \u00a3 50,000 per child .", 
                "a further \u00a3 150m was being spent annually on destitute families who had had their asylum applications turned down but who remained in the uk , he said .", 
                "if we are going to scale those numbers up significantly we need to make sure that those kinds of resources are available to england 's councils and also other public services to make sure that we have what is required in terms of school places , hospital beds , gps , that sort of thing .", 
                "simmonds added that councils would welcome the numbers if other families followed the example of bob geldof , who has offered to put up four refugee families at his homes in kent and london .", 
                "but he suggested the priority would be to place refugees who were already in the uk rather than those awaiting re-settlement from the camps .", 
                "i am sure that many local councils would be delighted if those who have got space are making that offer because i am sure that we could offer those places to some of the refugee families who are already in the uk ."
