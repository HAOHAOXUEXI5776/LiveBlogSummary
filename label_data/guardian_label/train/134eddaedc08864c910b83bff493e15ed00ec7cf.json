                "there is the potential for very dramatic flooding , said abbott at a press conference in austin , the state capital .",

                "donald trump proposed a 2018 budget in may that included severe cuts to social safety net programmes and a $ 667m cut in funding for fema , the federal emergency management agency , which is in charge of disaster response .", 
                "trump 's budget stands no chance of becoming law in its current form and is in some senses an opening bid the final federal budget for 2018 will be passed by congress .", 
                "and $ 667m may be a relatively small cut to a fema budget for 2017 of $ 16.2bn .", 
                "nevertheless the programmes trump wants to cut such as the pre-disaster mitigation grant program which is supposed to help states and local communities prepare for future disasters will be missed by the states that use them .", 
                "these cuts would cost the district close to $ 30m , brian baker , director of department of homeland security and emergency management for washington dc , told the new york times in july .", 
                "the office of the new york mayor , bill de blasio , also lamented the millions that would be lost , including in grants for counter-terrorism .", 
                "but there was more enthusiasm for brock long , former emergency management agency director for alabama chosen by trump to be fema director .", 
                "kristy dahl , a climate scientist at the union of concerned scientists , told the guardian : [ long ] is certainly well qualified for the job and he was one of the rare appointments by the trump administration that was widely hailed as reasonable and appointing someone with appropriate experience to the job .", 
                "brock has relationships with state emergency managers across the country .", 
                "he can put himself in their shoes , art faulkner , the current director of the alabama agency , told the new york times .", 
                "he knows what we go through in dealing with these issues .", 
                "here are the full details of the fema cuts proposed by trump in his budget blueprint : eliminates or reduces state and local grant funding by $ 667 million for programs administered by the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) that are either unauthorized by the congress , such as fema 's pre-disaster mitigation grant program , or that must provide more measurable results and ensure the federal government is not supplanting other stakeholders ' responsibilities , such as the homeland security grant program .", 
                "for that reason , the budget also proposes establishing a 25 percent non-federal cost match for fema preparedness grant awards that currently require no cost match .", 
                "this is the same cost-sharing approach as fema 's disaster recovery grants .",
