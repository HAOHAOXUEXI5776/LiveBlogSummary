                "from that point , february 10th , until i announced my formal recusal on march 2nd , i was never briefed on any investigative details and did not access information about the investigation ; i received only the limited information that the department 's career officials determined was necessary to inform my recusal decision .",

                "it is a clear statement of my views .", 
                "it is absurd , frankly , to suggest that a recusal from a single specific investigation would render an attorney general unable to manage the leadership of the various department of justice law enforcement components that conduct thousands of investigations .",

                "mr. comey well knew them , i thought , and assumed correctly that he complied with them .", 
                "i will finish with this .",
