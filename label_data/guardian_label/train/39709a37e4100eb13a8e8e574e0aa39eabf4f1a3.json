                "/pacific / barcroft india here 's our story wrapping up the night 's events : eu ministers begin drive to deliver bailout as greece gives bitter consent read more meanwhile there are still hurdles to overcome , with the german parliament set to vote on the deal on friday and eu officials scrambling to put together a \u20ac7bn bridging loan to tide greece through the next few weeks .", 
                "despite some resistance - including from the uk - it appears the efsm stability mechanism will be used for the arrangement .", 
                "non-eurozone countries had wanted guarantees they would be protected if greece did not repay the loans .", 
                "the eurogroup of finance ministers is due to hold a conference call to discuss the situation at 8.00 gmt ( 9.00 bst ) , as tweeted by its spokesman last night : michel reijns ( @ michelreijns ) confirmation just went out : # eurogroup teleconference tomorrow 10 am # greece there are also some doubts as to whether the bailout package will actually do the job intended , with little prospect of the greek economy recovering using severe austerity measures without some form of debt relief and a plan for growth .", 
                "meanwhile the ecb will also be in the spotlight .", 
                "[ not the english cricket board - there will be a separate live blog for the test match with australia ] the european central bank makes its normal policy statement and holds its normal press conference at lunchtime .", 
                "but given these are not normal times , the questioning will be on what the bank will do about its emergency liquidity assistance for greek banks .", 
                "it could increase the ela , reducing the squeeze on the banks , and paving the way for them to reopen .", 
                "any move , however , is likely to be modest ."
