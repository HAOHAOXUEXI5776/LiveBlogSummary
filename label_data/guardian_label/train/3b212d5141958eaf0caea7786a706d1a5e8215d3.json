                "here are some of the the key points for discussion : ahmet davutoglu , turkey 's prime minister , has signalled the country may be willing to accept people being returned to turkey if they do not qualify for asylum in europe , such as moroccans and pakistanis .", 
                "last week , more than 300 people were sent back to turkey from greece , hailed as a major step forward by eu diplomats .",

                "it is naked self-interest and wishful thinking to say turkey is a safe country of asylum it is not , and this deal could cause much more harm than good .", 
                "the timing of the summit is awkward , given that over the weekend the turkish newspaper zaman was seized by the government and its editor-in-chief removed , sparking an outcry over press freedoms .", 
                "on a similar note : there will also be a gathering of the european commission next week , focusing on proposals to overhaul the eu 's asylum system , which requires refugees to register and be processed in the country they arrive in .",
