                "why not all women can strike on international women 's day read more mona chalabi writes for the guardian that not all women can strike today some , because they lack the power , and some , because the work ca n't happen without them : international women 's day has always been tied to labor rights ( first by the socialist party of america in 1908 , and later by female textile workers in russia in 1917 ) .", 
                "but that has n't meant that every woman in the workforce has been able to take part .", 
                "then and now , women have worked in jobs where striking just is n't an option .", 
                "there are various reasons for that .", 
                "in the us , women are more likely than men to work in part-time employment where workers are often considered more disposable .", 
                "they are also less likely than men to receive a pension , more likely than men to live in poverty and more likely to be paid hourly rates that are belowminimum wage .", 
                "that makes striking risky , and this is before you even get to the astounding amount of unpaid work women do , including caregiver roles where taking a day off can be a matter of life and death .", 
                "there are other occupations where women make up the majority .", 
                "pre-schoolers in america will have a tough time learning today if their teachers , 98 % of whom are female , do decide to go on strike .",

                "but guardian columnist lindy west , speaking on australian tv this week , while agreeing that protest is most effective when it disrupts people 's lives , echoed concerns of others who are cautious about the proposed strike : it would be tremendously effective if we could mobilise every single woman in the world \u0080\u00a6 a concern for me , as a very privileged , financially stable white woman who works from home \u0080\u00a6 it 's very easy for me to say yes , everyone should go on strike but i want to be very cognisant of the fact there are very many women who can not afford to lose one day 's worth of pay , let alone risk their job .",
