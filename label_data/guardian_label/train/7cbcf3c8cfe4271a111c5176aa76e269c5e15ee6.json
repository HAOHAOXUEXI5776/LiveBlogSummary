                "here are some of the key quotes from lord mandelson 's brexit talk at the institute for government earlier .", 
                "mandelson said theresa may should resist the wild men '' in her party .", 
                "the wild men of her party have already started to agitate against expecting any such terms which they think would amount to a bad deal if she gives in , in my view , to the wild men and to the right of her party , i think she will only have herself to blame when the awful reality of our position dawns .", 
                "and it will .", 
                "there will then be no blaming the remainers by her , no blaming the remoaners , or the eu .", 
                "she will have brought this on herself if she gives in at any stage in this negotiation to these people in her party .", 
                "he said that adopting an approach that would damage the uk as a negotiating strategy ( leaving the eu without a trade deal ) would be a sign of insanity '' .", 
                "to those who say we have to countenance no deal as a negotiating tactic , i would just say that threatening to shoot yourself in both feet is really not a credible negotiating tactic .", 
                "it is , instead , a sign of insanity .", 
                "threatening the eu on security cooperation has already got us nowhere - indeed it 's gone down very badly .", 
                "he said remain supporters should wish may well in the brexit negotiations .", 
                "i think it would be very churlish of those , like me , in the remain camp , not to wish her well , even though - i think and i feel this passionately - that a free trade agreement is a clear second best to staying fully in the single market .", 
                "in effect i am saying that the leave people should not tie her hands during this negotiation , and those of us in the remain camp should back her up in the negotiation without of course giving blanket support for any outcome .", 
                "he said may should not give people unrealistic expectations .", 
                "the one thing also she should n't do with the british public is feed them unrealistic expectations .", 
                "this idea that britain can have its cake and eat it in this , all that 's going to do is to dash expectations when people find they ca n't have their cake and eat it .", 
                "there will be a public backlash then , and a further erosion of trust in politicians and in the government .", 
                "he said that the eu exit bill '' would be small change '' in relative terms and that the uk should agree to pay it quickly .", 
                "i would just settle the tab , pay the money , do it as quickly as possible .", 
                "it 's not going to be a vast sum of money - it will be a vast sum of money but as a percentage of our public spending , our gdp of this country , given that it 's going to be paid over very many years , it 's small change .", 
                "and i would deal with the small change of the financial settlement in the first negotiation , as quickly as you can , to the second stage of the negotiation , which is about the future trade arrangements .", 
                "he said the rightwing media barons have may in a form of lockdown '' .", 
                "i think the press , as everyone knows , are motivated and driven by that cabal of the barclay brothers in their splendid isolation in their castle in the channel islands , trying to steer brexit onto the rocks ; by paul dacre of the daily mail , who has an ideological fixation as well as a very venal temperament ; rupert murdoch , of course , from either california or new york , trying to pull the strings of britain 's future as well .", 
                "between the four of them i do n't think there 's any likelihood of their changing their mood or their tenor .", 
                "they are on the prime minister 's case .", 
                "to date they 've had her in a form of lockdown .", 
                "he said the choice facing people in an election now would be ghastly '' .", 
                "i mean , what on earth would the country do , in a choice between hard brexit and the hard left ?", 
                "god , is this is what politics in this country has come to ?", 
                "it 's too ghastly .",

                "the brexit negotiating guidelines agreed by the european parliament this morning are not binding .", 
                "what will matter most will be the guidelines agreed by eu leaders at the summit that donald tusk , the president of the european council , has called for saturday 29 april .", 
                "but the meps ' guidelines will be influential .", 
                "any final brexit deal needs the approval of the european parliament and , although the prospect of the parliament blocking a deal seems very remote , the threat of such a veto may give meps some leverage .", 
                "and it is significant that the guidelines have the backing of all the pro-eu groups in the parliament .", 
                "tusk will finalise the eu 's negotiating guidelines at the end of this month but he released draft guidelines on friday last week .", 
                "you can read them in full here .", 
                "the parliament 's guidelines , which you can read here , overlap with tusk 's in many respects .", 
                "but they are also more detailed and , in several respects , noticeably tougher '' than tusk 's .", 
                "the 560-133 vote in favour of them in luxembourg this morning will not make theresa may 's task any easier .", 
                "here are 10 key points from the parliament 's guidelines , with notes showing how they differ from the tusk guidelines .", 
                "1 - the uk must not be offered a deal that offers all the advantages of single market membership .", 
                "[ the parliament ] regrets the decision by the united kingdom government not to participate in the internal market , the european economic area or the customs union ; considers that a state withdrawing from the union can not enjoy similar benefits to those enjoyed by a union member state , and therefore announces that it will not consent to any agreement that would contradict this .", 
                "note : this is a key principle , and the tusk guidelines says something very similar .", 
                "2 - talks on a future uk-eu trade deal should not start until substantial progress '' has been made in the talks on the withdrawal deal .", 
                "note : this is a flashpoint , because the uk wants the exit talks and the trade talks to run in parallel .", 
                "the tusk guidelines say much the same , although they talk about the need for sufficient progress '' on withdrawal before trade talks can start .", 
                "the parliament 's threshold ( substantial '' ) is higher .", 
                "3 - the uk-eu trade deal can only be concluded after the uk has left the eu .", 
                "note : the tusk guidelines say the same .", 
                "the uk government has now accepted this , dashing theresa may 's hopes of finalising a trade deal within two years .", 
                "4 - the european court of justice must be the competent authority for the interpretation and enforcement of the withdrawal agreement '' .", 
                "note : this is more specific than the tusk guidelines , which say the withdrawal agreement should include appropriate dispute settlement mechanisms '' , implying the ecj might not be the court that polices the deal .", 
                "5 - britain must pay an exit bill .", 
                "[ the parliament ] stresses that a single financial settlement with the united kingdom on the basis of the european union 's annual accounts as audited by the european court of auditors must include all its legal liabilities arising from outstanding commitments as well as making provision for off-balance sheet items , contingent liabilities and other financial costs arising directly as a result of the united kingdom 's withdrawal .", 
                "note : the tusk guidelines are similar , but they do not include the line about the uk 's bill including other financial costs arising directly as a result of the united kingdom 's withdrawal '' , which implies perhaps that the parliament favours a more stringent approach to calculating the uk 's liabilities .", 
                "6 - any future uk-eu trade deal must not allow the uk to cut standards .", 
                "[ the parliament ] stresses that any future agreement between the european union and the united kingdom is conditional on the united kingdom 's continued adherence to the standards provided by international obligations , including human rights , and the union 's legislation and policies , in , among others , the fields of the environment , climate change , the fight against tax evasion and avoidance , fair competition , trade and social rights , especially safeguards against social dumping .", 
                "note : the tusk guidelines are very similar .", 
                "this condition is key , because it suggests that mps who want brexit to lead to a bonfire of regulation will find this incompatible with a uk-eu trade deal .", 
                "7 - any future uk-eu trade deal must not contain special sectoral provision '' for certain parts of the economy .", 
                "[ the parliament ] opposes any future agreement between the european union and the united kingdom that would contain piecemeal or sectorial provisions , including with respect to financial services , providing united kingdom-based undertakings with preferential access to the internal market and/or the customs union .", 
                "note : the tusk guidelines rule out the uk participating in the single market on a sector-by-sector approach '' , but the parliament 's go further , significantly ruling out a special deal for city .", 
                "in her lancaster house speech may floated the idea of the uk being able to keep single market arrangements in areas like the car sector or banking .", 
                "these guidelines rule that out .", 
                "8 - european court of justice rulings should continue to apply to the uk during any transition period .", 
                "note : the tusk guidelines essentially say the same , although they are not quite as specific .", 
                "9 - any transitional period should last for no longer than three years .", 
                "note : this more specific than the tusk guidelines , which say any transitional arrangements should be time-limited '' but do not say for how long .", 
                "10 - if the uk starts trade negotiations with other countries before brexit , that will be against eu rules .", 
                "it would be contrary to union law for the united kingdom to begin , in advance of its withdrawal , negotiations on possible trade agreements with third countries .", 
                "note : this is just a statement of eu law ( although at what point informal talks , of the kind liam fox has been having with foreign trade ministers , becomes a negotiation '' is not clear ) .", 
                "but the parliament 's decision to include it reads like a warning ."
