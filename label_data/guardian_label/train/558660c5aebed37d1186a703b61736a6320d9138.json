                "yesterday 's vote in the house of commons was a landmark moment in the brexit process and all the coverage in today 's papers reflects that .", 
                "but it meant that some of the speeches got overlooked , in particular an important one from andy burnham .", 
                "burnham , who was shadow home secretary before leaving the shadow cabinet to become labour 's candidate for mayor of greater manchester , has in the past expressed doubts about the impact of allowing eu migrants unlimited access to the uk .", 
                "but in the debate he went further , saying that the eu referendum result showed that the status quo was unsustainable and that the left had failed to accept the need for migration reform .", 
                "the left across europe has got to break out of its paralysis on this issue .", 
                "the fear of being labelled as pandering '' stops people entering the debate , but it also stops progressive ideas that meet the public 's concerns and leaves the pitch clear for those with right-wing solutions .", 
                "i want to set out two principal reasons why there is a legitimate left-wing case for reform .", 
                "first , in an era of increasing globalisation , free movement has arguably been providing greater benefit to large companies than it has to the most deprived communities .", 
                "there is nothing socialist about a system of open borders that allows multinationals to treat people as commodities and to move them around europe to drive down labour costs and create a race to the bottom .", 
                "secondly , there is a strong case for saying that the immigration system that has developed over time in this country is inherently discriminatory burnham even claimed that the labour party 's failure to grasp the need for migration controls was putting people at risk .", 
                "he told mps : it is time for many of us on this side of the house to confront a hard truth : our reluctance in confronting this debate is undermining the cohesion of our communities and the safety of our streets .", 
                "i am no longer prepared to be complicit in that .", 
                "we need answers to the public 's concerns , but answers that are based on hope , not hate .", 
                "his comments are particularly to because this morning the commons home affairs committee is launching an inquiry intended to trigger a national debate about migration .", 
                "yvette cooper , the committee 's chair , said in a statement released this morning : immigration is one of the most important issues facing our country and will be central to the brexit deal .", 
                "britain voted for change , especially on free movement , but there has been very little debate about what kind of reforms or immigration control that should now mean or how we get the best deal for the country .", 
                "successive governments have failed on immigration and public concern has grown .", 
                "yet too often the polarised nature of the debate makes it hard to get consensus over what should be done instead .", 
                "if there is no consensus behind the most important parts of the brexit deal in the end it will unravel .", 
                "that is why our cross party committee will be holding a different kind of inquiry - looking outward at the country not inward at the government .", 
                "instead of just taking evidence in westminster , we will be travelling round every region and nation , holding public meetings , bringing local people together for debates and discussions , citizens juries , and online consultations .", 
                "we are encouraging other organisations to run events and debates too - community groups , business organisations , faith groups , think tanks , local councils , mps , media organisations .", 
                "we want to hear people 's views both about immigration and about how they believe that common ground can be found to stop this issue dividing the country .", 
                "i will be covering more from her press conference later .", 
                "here is the agenda for the day .", 
                "9.30am : jeremy wright , the attorney general , takes questions in the commons .", 
                "9.30am : nhs england publishes its monthly hospital waiting time figures .", 
                "9.30am : the office for national statistics publishes domestic abuse figures .", 
                "10am : yvette cooper , the chair of the commons home affairs committee , holds a press conference to announce details of her committee 's new immigration inquiry .", 
                "and in sleaford and north hykeham people are voting in the byelection .", 
                "the conservatives are expected to hold the seat easily .", 
                "as usual , i will also be covering the breaking political news as it happens , as well as bringing you the best reaction , comment and analysis from the web .", 
                "i plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon .",

                "i do try to answer direct questions , although sometimes i miss them or do n't have time .", 
                "alternatively you could post a question to me on twitter ."
