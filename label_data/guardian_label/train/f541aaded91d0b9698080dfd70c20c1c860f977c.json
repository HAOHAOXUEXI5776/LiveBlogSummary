                "good morning .", 
                "there 's a sense of relief in the eurozone this morning after greece and its creditors finally hammered out a deal to unlock \u20ac10bn in bailout funds , and trigger work on debt relief .", 
                "after a lengthy meeting , which we liveblogged through the night , ministers emerged to report that a breakthrough had been reached .", 
                "both sides appear to have given some ground to get the deal onto the table .", 
                "one the one hand , all creditors have agreed that greece 's debt mountain is unsustainable - suggesting germany has given up some ground .", 
                "on the other , debt relief is n't as immediate or concrete as the international monetary fund has been demanded , meaning the fund has made concessions too .", 
                "eurozone reaches breakthrough on greek bailout and debt relief - as it happened read more if you were snoozing during the action , here 's the key points : 1 ) greece has finally received the green light to receive more than \u20ac10bn in bailout funds , easing concerns that it could face financial peril this summer .", 
                "a few prior actions do remain , concerning pensions and privatisations , but once that is resolved , the money will flow - starting with \u20ac7.5bn in june .", 
                "eurogroup president jeroen dijsselbloem told reporters that greece 's programme was back on track .", 
                "we achieved a major breakthrough on greece which enables us to enter a new phase in the greek financial assistance programme this is stretching what i thought would have been possible not so long ago . ''", 
                "2 ) in an important development , the international monetary fund has signalled that it could join the bailout .", 
                "that could happen by the end of 2016 .", 
                "however , the imf 's european chief poul thomsen insisted that the fund must check that the eurozone is offering substantial debt relief .", 
                "in a rare public appearance , thomsen said : we welcome that all stakeholders recognise that greek debt is unsustainable .", 
                "we welcome that it is understood that greece needs debt relief to make it sustainable .", 
                "3 ) eurozone ministers have agreed to a package of debt measures '' to make greece 's debts sustainable .", 
                "that will start with short-term tweaks to greece 's debts , to smooth out its obligations .", 
                "medium-term measures are also promised , although not until 2018 , which looks like a concession from the imf .", 
                "there is also a commitment to consider whether further restructuring will be needed once the bailout ends , assuming athens sticks to the programme and everything works out .", 
                "however , this does n't appear to be as comprehensive , wide-ranging and unconditional as the imf has been demanding .", 
                "4 ) the deal has been generally welcomed by greece 's finance minister .", 
                "euclid tsakalotos said it would help end the country 's vicious circle of austerity and recession .", 
                "donald tusk , the head of the european council , said the greek deal was good for the global economy .", 
                "slovakia 's finance minister peter kazimir also sounded satisfied , comparing the negotiations to a complicated birth '' .", 
                "and france 's michel sapin was positively upbeat , saying the deal was first and foremost a declaration of confidence in today 's greece . ''", 
                "but that was last night .",
