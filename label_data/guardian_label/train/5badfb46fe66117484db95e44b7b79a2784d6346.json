                "then texas senator ted cruz stepped on to the dais .", 
                "in stunning remarks during the primetime tv hour apparently designed to lay the groundwork for a future bid for the presidency , cruz refused to formally endorse donald trump as the republican presidential nominee .",

                "the apparent slap in the face to the republican presidential nominee , probably the result of a bitter primary fight between the two which included trump attacking the physical appearance of cruz 's wife heidi , and implicating cruz 's father in the assassination of john f kennedy ignited a cacophony of booing during cruz 's remarks , echoed by the nominee himself : donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) wow , ted cruz got booed off the stage , did n't honor the pledge !",

                "not only will trump have to unify a clearly fractured republican party whose wounds from the primary have yet to heal he will also have to deliver a speech unparalleled by any remarks he has made in his 13 months as a candidate to retake the news cycle .", 
                "with nearly three days lost to the epic mismanagement of the melania trump speech scandal , and another to cruz 's remarks , trump has only one chance to wrest the narrative back under his control before the democratic national convention next week drowns him in negative coverage .",
