                "a new offence of aiding and abetting tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance is expected to be included in the budget next month , george osborne has said in his first comprehensive parliamentary response to the hsbc scandal .", 
                "as nicholas watt reports , the chancellor , who declined to say whether he asked the former hsbc group chief executive lord green hurstpierpoint about his tax affairs before his appointment as trade minister in 2011 , also indicated that britain is close to reaching an agreement with the french authorities to widen the use of the leaked hsbc files .", 
                "the deal will mean that law enforcement agencies , including the serious fraud office , will be able to make use of the files in addition to hmrc .", 
                "the chancellor made his announcement during an urgent question in the commons tabled by the shadow chancellor ed balls .", 
                "on the planned new offence of aiding and abetting tax evasion , the chancellor said : ahead of the budget i set the treasury to work on providing further ways to pursue not just the tax evaders but those providing them with advice .", 
                "anyone involved in tax evasion , whatever your role , this government is coming after you .", 
                "unlike the last government , who simply turned a blind eye , this government is taking action now and will do so again at the budget .", 
                "the conservative leadership has suspended the party whip from sir malcolm rifkind , the former foreign secretary , in the wake of the cash-for-access allegations involving a fictitious chinese company .", 
                "the labour party has challenged david cameron to state whether he will take part in the tv leaders ' debates in the runup to may 's general election after the running order of the three debates was revealed on monday following the drawing of lots between the broadcasters involved .", 
                "a head-to-head debate between cameron and ed miliband is last on the schedule , on 30 april , days before the vote .", 
                "it is to be presented by jeremy paxman and kay burley .", 
                "ukip 's plans to make immigrants have health insurance for their first five years in britain would not lead to ill people being denied treatment , nigel farage has said .", 
                "as rowena mason reports , unveiling his party 's health policy on monday , the ukip leader confirmed that tourists , students and all those moving permanently except refugees would need medical cover before entering the country .", 
                "however , the party has not yet set out precise details about how this would work , including whether more visitors would need visas to enter , the method of policing it and how those who were already in the country without cover would be dealt with .", 
                "david cameron has said that airlines and internet companies need to do more to prevent radicalised british teenagers travelling to the middle east to join radical group islamic state .", 
                "in a statement to mps on last week 's eu summit , he said he was horrified '' over by the case of three london girls believed to have travelled to syria to join is after being indoctrinated by extremists online .", 
                "as the press association reports , he announced that home secretary theresa may and transport secretary patrick mcloughlin will be talking with airlines on new proportionate '' arrangements to ensure that children who are at risk are properly identified and questioned , and said border police should be alerted of any concerns so they can stop individuals from travelling .", 
                "tristram hunt , the shadow education secretary , has announced plans to reinvigorate the status and qualifications of headteachers in england , aimed at overhauling the skills needed for the increasingly complex task of running successful state schools .", 
                "cameron has confirmed that universal benefits for pensioners will once again be protected if the conservatives win may 's general election .", 
                "cameron has dismissed calls for a change in the law to specifically ban abortions on grounds of gender , insisting existing legislation is sufficiently strong .", 
                "mps are due to debate the proposal later today .", 
                "nick clegg has said that thousands of offenders are being jailed unnecessarily .",

                "he also dismissed the claim that prison works '' as nothing more than a slogan '' when the reality for many offenders is that it makes their problems worse .",

                "however , as the press association reports , justin welby said the church had been clear the move towards '' having the living wage paid across all parishes , cathedrals and diocese was a gradual process which would take time .",

                "3 - why did you and david cameron appoint lord green as a conservative peer and minister months after the government received these files ?", 
                "because we thought he would do a good job as trade minister .", 
                "and so did the labour party .",

                "here are the main points from sir malcolm rifkind 's today interview .", 
                "i 've beefed up the post from earlier , with some added quotes from politicshome .", 
                "rifkind said the claims that he had done anything wrong were unfounded '' and that that he would fight them vigorously .", 
                "these are unfounded and i am going to fight them with all my strength .", 
                "he said he was hugely irritated and angry '' about the allegations .", 
                "i 'm going to be hugely irritated and angry because i 've got nothing to be embarrassed about .", 
                "every single thing i said to these people , i would have been willing to say on television or to you if you 'd put the same questions to me at the time .", 
                "he said it was perfectly acceptable for mps to have outside interests .", 
                "the basic allegation is there is something improper about a member of parliament being willing to take part in , in this case in an advisory board , in a company that is seeking to invest in the united kingdom .", 
                "but of course there are probably 200 mps who have various business interests other than their mps salary .", 
                "some people disapprove of that , and maybe the labour party disapproves of that .", 
                "but many of the public take a different view .", 
                "many say , actually , we do n't want full-time politicians .", 
                "we want members of parliament to have some outside experience of the wider world .", 
                "he said senior business and professional figures would not enter parliament if mps were banned from having second jobs .", 
                "if you 're trying to attract people of a business or a professional background to serve in the house of commons and if they 're not ministers , it is quite unrealistic to think they will go through their parliamentary career being able to simply accept a salary of \u00a3 60,000 .", 
                "that sounds a lot to a lot of people earning less than that , but the vast majority of people of a business or professional background earn far , far more than that .", 
                "he said the undercover team were just asking him to serve on an advisory board .", 
                "i received an email from them saying 'we are setting up an advisory board for the company , we want to have on that board people of a senior business background and people with political experience ' - they never mentioned mps .", 
                "and they want the people on their advisory board to give us advice on the regulatory , financial and political position in many european countries , not just the united kingdom many companies have advisory boards - many ex-ministers , former chancellors , home secretaries , prime ministers as well as other people have served on advisory boards .", 
                "he said he would not stand down as chair of parliament 's intelligence and security committee , unless his colleagues on the committee insisted , because this had nothing to do with his role as isc chair .", 
                "he said he had a letter from channel 4 accepting that he was not offering access to privileged information .", 
                "it 's well worth bearing in mind that channel 4 themselves - i have a letter from them when they first contacted me saying 'we accept that you , in these discussions you had , were not offering access to any privileged or secret information ' .", 
                "i 've got that in writing from them and it 's a pity they did n't emphasise that in their programme .", 
                "he criticised dispatches for not letting him appear on the programme to defend himself .", 
                "he said telling the undercover reporters he did not get a salary as a silly thing to say '' .", 
                "but he was talking in the context of his business activities , not his role as an mp , he said .", 
                "he explained why he talked about having access to ambassadors in his conversation with the undercover team .", 
                "they said : 'one of the things we 'd be interested in is actually finding out what the investment opportunities might be in various continental european countries - in france , in germany , in romania , bulgaria and so forth - could you help us in that way ? '", 
                "so i said : 'well , the only help i could give you , but i could give you it , is i could contact the romanian or bulgarian ambassador in london and ask them to speak to you and answer your questions ' .", 
                "that 's exactly what i said ."
