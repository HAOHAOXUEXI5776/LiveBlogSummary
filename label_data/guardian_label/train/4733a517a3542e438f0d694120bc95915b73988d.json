            "text": [
                "here are the key points from david cameron 's evidence to the liaison committee .", 
                "cameron said that british military personnel are to be deployed to ukraine over the next few weeks to provide advice and training to government troops .", 
                "he said he would not rule out supplying ukraine with lethal equipment .", 
                "i do n't say that we should rule out forever going further [ ie , supplying lethal military equipment ] - i know america is thinking carefully about this - but i think we 've had national security council discussions , we 've had very clear decisions that we should be in the space of providing non-lethal support , the help , the advice .", 
                "he said he did not think there would be a military solution to the crisis in ukraine .", 
                "the reason for not going further is we do n't believe , fundamentally , there is some military solution to this issue .", 
                "there needs to be a diplomatic solution which i think should be enabled by sanctions and pressure and the economic weight of europe and america .", 
                "he said further russian aggression would trigger more sanctions .", 
                "he said excluding russia from the international swift banking system was an option .", 
                "if there was major further incursion by russian-backed forces and effectively russian forces into ukraine we should be clear about what that is .", 
                "that is trying to dismember a democracy , a member of the united nations , a sovereign state on the continent of europe , and it 's not acceptable .", 
                "i would hope that the european union collectively would respond very robustly with new sanctions , including so-called tier three sanctions , really hitting the economy of russia .", 
                "but were that not possible then , of course , we should look at other avenues as well - obviously looking at the swift banking issues is a big decision but there is a logic for it , which is if russia is going to leave the rules-based system of the 21st century , then they have to start thinking about whether it 's going to be in the 21st century system when it comes to investment , when it comes to banking , when it comes to clearing houses , when it comes to the other things that make our world work .", 
                "he hinted that the government could give the bbc world service more funding to provide news to the baltic states .", 
                "i think we need to do more frankly in the area of information .", 
                "one of the complaints we get from the baltic states is there is nothing to counter the deluge of russian-paid and backed media spreading disinformation .", 
                "we have got to recognise one of the strengths we have got as a country - although we do n't always necessarily see it this way - is that we have a very strong and impartial media , we have a wonderful brand in the bbc known for its impartial views .", 
                "we should be supporting the bbc to provide news services and news channels where people otherwise are getting a diet of russian disinformation .", 
                "he played down the significance of the recent incidents involving russian jets encroaching on british airspace .", 
                "so far this year the raf has scrambled the quick reaction aircraft twice , last year it was eight times .", 
                "go back to 2011 it was 10 times , in 2007 it was 19 occasions .", 
                "i think we should be strong , measured and clear .", 
                "but we should be absolutely confident that in our air force and in the typhoons and the pilots - we have 135 typhoons now in service - we are more than capable of protecting our air space when we look at the situation in ukraine let 's not talk ourselves into some idea that this has all been a fantastic success for russia .", 
                "it has n't been .", 
                "because a couple of russian planes fly around the channel we should n't talk ourselves in to a situation where we think somehow we can not defend ourselves .", 
                "we absolutely can .", 
                "he said that the fact that britain was not involved in the latest minsk peace talks did not mean the country was losing influence .", 
                "we should n't be too precious about not being involved in every different set of negotiations .", 
                "there is no point endlessly obsessing about whether or not you are in the room .", 
                "we have a very clear role when it comes to ukraine .",
