                "over in greece this morning there has been much merriment over the euro group 's decision last night to define the contours of a debt relief agreement for the country long at the centre of europe 's financial crisis .", 
                "our correspondent helena smith reports from athens for the first time since economic crisis engulfed greece just over seven years ago , a sitting government in athens has felt fit to describe a decision taken in brussels as a national success .", 
                "the positive spin and brave faces that have greeted the three bailouts rolled out for greece , so far , have today been superseded by a genuine sense of relief at the announcement of short-term measures to lighten the country 's mountainous debt load .", 
                "many in syriza , the governing left-wing party , said the move by euro zone partners to shave \u0082\u00ac45bn euros off the pile the equivalent of 22 percent of gdp by extending the repayment period and adjusting interest rates - exceeded every expectation .", 
                "addressing reporters today the government spokesman dimitris tzanakopoulos described the decision both as a significant achievement and decisive step for the stabilisation of the greek economy and complete restoration of confidence .", 
                "riot police walk past the greek parliament building today , during an anniversary rally marking the 2008 police shooting of 15-year-old student , alexandros grigoropoulos .", 
                "konstantinidis/reuters but as greece 's political opposition was quick to point out the victory was bittersweet .", 
                "this might be the first time that the nation 's unmanageable debt burden has been addressed head-on and as such can only be seen as rich reward for prime minister alexis tsipras - but it comes against a backdrop of calls for athens to adopt yet more austerity once its current bailout programme expires in mid-2018 .", 
                "amid signs of a looming showdown with the international monetary fund , which says further belt-tightening is the only way to plug the looming fiscal gap and thus ensure its own participation in greece 's third bailout to date , the spokesman called the demands irrational .", 
                "athens , he insisted , would neither accept the german proposal for greece to achieve a primary surplus of 3.5 % through 2028 nor the imf 's demands for extra measures in 2019 and 2020 .", 
                "both are expected to dominate talks when auditors representing creditor institutions return to continue negotiating a second review of policy measures set as the price of bailout funds .", 
                "greek society can not endure more measures , said interior minister panos skourletis hinting at the battle that is brewing .", 
                "the greek economy ca n't endure them either .",
