                "george osborne , the chancellor , has signalled that the government is going to partially back down over tax credits after peers inflicted a double defeat on the government , voting for amendments to delay implementation of the tax credit cuts until ministers have produced a scheme for full transitional protection '' for those who will lose out .",

                "the lords votes were questionable , in constitutional terms , potentially for three reasons ; because the lords by convention does not block manifesto commitments ( the salisbury convention ) ; because it does not normally block secondary legislation ; and because it is prevented by parliamentary rules and by convention from amending budget measures .",
