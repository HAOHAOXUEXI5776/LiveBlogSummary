                "good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy , the financial markets , the eurozone and business .", 
                "the squeeze on living standards is a key issue in britain today , after inflation hit a four-year high on tuesday .", 
                "and today we get a new healthcheck on the uk labour market , which will probably confirm that pay packets are struggling to keep up with the rising cost of living .", 
                "the figures will cover the first three months of this year .", 
                "economists predict that britain 's unemployment rate probably remained at 4.7 % , the lowest rate in over 40 years , with employment at a record high .", 
                "but the real story will probably be found in the wage growth figures .", 
                "basic pay is expected to have risen by around 2.2 % per year in the quarter - rather less than the 2.7 % inflation rate recorded in april .", 
                "analysts at rbc capital markets say : the march labour data are likely to show a third consecutive month with the unemployment rate at 4.7 % .", 
                "that would mean a very modest change in the level of employment on a 3m/3m basis after the large gain of 92k 3m/3m in january and the still impressive +39k last month .", 
                "similarly on the average earnings front , there is limited scope for sharp changes in pay growth rates .", 
                "our uk economists are looking for unchanged average earnings growth of 2.3 % 3m/y including bonuses and 2.2 % 3m/y excluding bonuses .", 
                "so with the headline figures expected to move sideways broadly speaking , one area of potential interest will be the split between full- and part-time employment .", 
                "in the last couple of reports there has been a clear shift in favour of full-time work ; if repeated this time , it would arguably be a sign that some of the remaining slack in the labour market is being eroded .", 
                "the data come out at 9.30am bst .", 
                "also coming up today it 's a red letter day in the financial crisis , as the uk government finally sells its stake in lloyds banking group , nearly nine years after its bailout .", 
                "property developer british land , estate agent foxtons , and cybersecurity firm sophos are all reporting results .", 
                "and a general strike is underway in greece , as workers protest against the country 's austerity programme ."
