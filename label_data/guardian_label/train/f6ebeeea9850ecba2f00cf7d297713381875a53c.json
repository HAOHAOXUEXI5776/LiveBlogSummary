                "the new service 's roots go further back than that , however .", 
                "in 2009 , apple bought a streaming music startup called lala , and used its technology for the launch in 2011 of its itunes match cloud locker for storing music and accessing it from multiple devices .", 
                "that service continues as a part of apple music , although its maximum storage limit will increase from 25k songs to 100k songs later in the year , as part of apple 's ios 9 software update .", 
                "meanwhile , apple 's non-live radio stations made their debut in its itunes radio service , which launched in the us in 2013 , but never expanded overseas .", 
                "by contrast , apple music will launch in more than 100 countries .", 
                "apple faces considerable competition in the streaming market which , according to industry body the ifpi , had more than 41 million paying subscribers in 2014 , and a further 100 million accessing free tiers of streaming services like spotify .", 
                "that company is the largest player in the market , having recently announced that it has 75 million active users , with 20 million of them paying for its service .", 
                "we do n't really do anything else other than selling music , so we 're the most aligned with the music industry , spotify chief executive daniel ek recently told the guardian .", 
                "deezer claims 16 million users including 6 million subscribers , while paid-only service rhapsody reached 2.5m subscribers early in 2015 .", 
                "all these companies will be trying to crack the biggest challenge in the streaming world : convincing musicians and songwriters that their model can more than make up for the decline in sales of their music both in physical and download form with a number of artists having complained about paltry streaming royalty cheques .", 
                "the streaming services ' efforts to bring them round are complicated by the fact that they do not pay artists directly , but rather the labels that represent them , and whose contracts with those creators dictate the percentage of streaming income that finds its way to them ."
