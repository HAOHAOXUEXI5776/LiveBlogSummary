                "some quick evaluations of the performances by ben carson , marco rubio and ted cruz : ben carson had the benefit of being the first candidate on the state tonight , with a fresh audience in both the room and in tv land .", 
                "he was commended by moderator anderson cooper and by audience members for his even-keeled temperament and affect , but the candidate , already polling far below the top tier in south carolina , may have been cursed by his own affability on a question about replacing the late antonin scalia on the supreme court .", 
                "i probably would take the opportunity to nominate someone , carson said .", 
                "it does n't necessarily mean that person is going to be acted on or confirmed .", 
                "why not do it ?", 
                "carson 's lamentation about the destructive nature of partisanship is noble , but will do little to endear him to conservative south carolina primary voters who dread the prospect of barack obama replacing scalia - a justice of whom ted cruz later said : what ronald reagan was to the white house , scalia was to the supreme court .", 
                "marco rubio 's pushback against barack obama - who , it bears noting , is not a candidate for the republican nomination - on the issue of immigration was a momentary lapse in focus in what was otherwise a good night for the florida senator .", 
                "the high point , at least in terms of combating the # marcobot stereotype rubio has been fighting , may have been his comments on race and racism in america , mentioning his childhood in las vegas during the mariel boatlift .", 
                "whether you agree with them or not , if a significant percentage of the american family feels that they are being treated differently than anyone else , we have a problem then we have to address that as a society and as a country , rubio said about racism .", 
                "i do not believe we can fulfill our potential as a nation unless we address that .", 
                "i 'm not sure there is a political solution to that problem , but there are things we can do .", 
                "ted cruz started out strong , deftly ignoring attempts by cooper to goad him into attacking donald trump head-on and putting his harvard law degree to good use in detailing why his canadian birth does n't preclude him from the presidency .", 
                "but a mind-numbingly long answer on his history of antagonizing congressional colleagues in the us senate - at least , i think that 's what the original question was about - shifted dangerously close to the same stump-speech autopilot that rubio has faced such intense criticism for .", 
                "cruz later talked about the importance of having fun on the campaign trail - he might want to take his own advice next time .",
