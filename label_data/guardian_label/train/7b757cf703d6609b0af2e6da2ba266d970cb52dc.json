                "why ?", 
                "because , although cooper did not say anything particularly novel or revelatory , she made it clear that she could talk about a range of issues with knowledge and authority , and some humour too .", 
                "on policy , she is probably the most substantial of the four candidates .", 
                "she was particularly fluent on the economy ( a subject on which , partly because it was colonised by her husband , she has said little for the last five years ) .", 
                "and she made a good fist of addressing the claim that she had too much baggage '' .", 
                "as rafael behr says ( see below ) there may be dangers in her running the 'vote for me because i 'm a woman ' line , but she is probably right about david cameron .", 
                "if andy burnham , her main rival , wins , then cameron will have his pmqs script sorted for the next five years ( mid-staffs , unite , mid-staffs , unite , etc etc , ad nauseam ) .",

                "leadership contests , particularly those involving preferential voting systems , are often won by the person those voting object to least .",

                "i do n't think he quite knows how to handle women in parliament as well .", 
                "so i do think he has an issue .", 
                "he 's often had a blind spot in terms of doing the cabinet reshuffles in the past , and i think we should be calling him out on it .", 
                "my colleague rafael behr has a good take on this .", 
                "rafael behr ( @ rafaelbehr ) i suspect cooper is right abt cam struggling against a woman at pmqs , but not necessarily right to be making that a big sell in this contest she said voters would not want boris johnson in number 10 in a crisis and that labour could challenge him on a whole range of issues .", 
                "i think we can challenge boris johnson on a whole serious of things .", 
                "and do you really want boris johnson to be the person answering the phone when angela merkel calls and says 'what are we going to do about vladimir putin ? '", 
                "the challenge to boris johnson is about whether or not he can be a serious government minister , never mind anything more serious than that , and i think in parliament we can challenge him on that in a way that he ca n't be [ challenged ] as mayor .", 
                "we 've got to make sure that we do so .", 
                "she rejected claims that she had too much baggage '' to be labour leader .", 
                "this was a suggestion that liz kendall made in the labour hustings last night , when she said : i think we do need a fresh start and i do n't have the baggage of the past . ''",

                "she said that , if cameron tried to use the eu renegotiation to weaken workers ' rights in the uk by relaxing the impact of eu law , then he would make it harder for labour to support him in the referendum .", 
                "she said she still supported the return of the 50p top rate of tax of the highest earners .", 
                "she said that she was worried that eu leaders were under-estimating the impact of greece leaving the eurozone .", 
                "they thought the damage could be contained , she said .", 
                "but they were making the same mistake as us treasury officials were making when they thought it would be acceptable to let lehman brothers go bust , she said .", 
                "it 's hugely serious and i do worry that there seems to be a growing view about how to handle the problem of greece that is similar to the kind of view we saw in the us treasury over lehman brothers bank where the view seemed to be that somehow we can cut them off , cauterise the problem by letting them go .", 
                "we saw what happened .",
