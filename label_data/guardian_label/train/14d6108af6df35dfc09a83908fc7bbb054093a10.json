                "on the first morning of the royal commission into the protection and detention of children in the northern territory we 've heard the opening address from senior counsel , and most of the questioning of the first witness , megan mitchell .", 
                "mitchell is the national children 's commissioner for the australian human rights commission .", 
                "there was a lot of detail covered , and much of it centred around international treaties and conventions and australia 's obligations .",

                "the commission has identified more than 50 reports and inquiries already undertaken with direct relevance to the commission 's terms of reference .", 
                "senior counsel assisting the commission , peter callaghan sc , has questioned whether australia has an inquiry mentality which sees that investigation is allowed as a substitution for action and reporting is accepted as a replacement for results .", 
                "the inquiry will look at the overrepresentation of aboriginal children among detainees and care and protection orders , as well as foetal alcohol spectrum disorder , psychological and intergeneration trauma , hearing loss , and medico-social issues .", 
                "the inquiry will not delve deeply into specific incidents , like the tear gassing at don dale in 2014 , because they 've already been investigated .", 
                "the use of isolation and force inside don dale was frequent and routine , mitchell says .", 
                "the use of force had become a matter of normal conduct , and several other failings of the centre were also in breach of human rights , she said .", 
                "if australia signed and ratified the optional protocol on the convention against torture ( opcat ) it would provide for greater oversight mechanisms in juvenile detention , mitchell said .", 
                "governments and justice systems should not use detention as a welfare response said mitchell .",

                "the deal for the nt government to pay 50 % would stand , he said .", 
                "if we tackled children 's problems when they were younger more effectively , detention centres would probably be obsolete in the future , mitchell said .",
