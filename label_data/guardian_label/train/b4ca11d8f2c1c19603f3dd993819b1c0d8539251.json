                "or does it want to gradually move away from it ?", 
                "and the uk 's reply to these questions will be very important , and even decisive , because it will shape the discussion on our future relationship , and shape also the condition for ratification of that partnership in many national parliaments , and obviously in the european parliament .", 
                "i do n't say that to create a problem .", 
                "i just say that to avoid problems , to say clearly what are the conditions for the success of ratification in this second stage of the negotiation .", 
                "in this passage barnier identified the key dilemma for the uk - and one which is probably more even more contentious than the size of the brexit bill .", 
                "last month it was reported that theresa may was leaning '' towards advocating a brexit outcome that would keep the uk broadly in line with eu regulation .", 
                "but , as the recent mail on sunday leak reveals , boris johnson , the foreign secretary , and michael gove , the environment secretary , told may in their secret letter to her that the uk should go for regulatory divergence .", 
                "the two vote leave campaign leaders wrote : it is critically important to improve our country after we leave the eu .", 
                "it requires a final eu deal that allows us a wide degree of regulatory freedom .", 
                "we may choose to remain identical to the eu - or we may embrace a vision more aligned with pro-competitive regulation .", 
                "philip hammond , the chancellor , is thought to be one of those in cabinet most keen on maintaing a degree of regulatory equivalence with the eu .", 
                "but even he may be wavering .", 
                "yesterday he told peston on sunday that leaving the eu would allow the uk to explore regulatory innovations '' .", 
                "he explained that by that he meant things like creating a regulatory environment where new tech businesses can flourish and prosper more quickly here than they would be able to in a more heavily regulated environment . ''", 
                "barnier said that , if the uk was willing to stay close to the eu regulatory regime , the eu would offer it its most ambitious '' free trade agreement .", 
                "he said : if we manage to negotiate an orderly withdrawal , fully respecting the integrity of the single market , and establish a level playing field , there is every reason for our future partnership to be ambitious .",

                "he said that although the british say they will not undermine the integrity of the uk single market , there are already numerous exceptions for northern ireland .", 
                "some in the uk say that specific rules for northern ireland would endanger the integrity of the uk single market .", 
                "but northern ireland already has specific rules in many areas that are different to the rest of the uk .", 
                "think of the whole island electricity market .",

                "brexit means brexit everywhere .",

                "the uk would not be allowed to cherry he insisted .", 
                "he said : there are in fact two contradicting soundbites from ardent advocates of brexit : the uk will finally set itself free from uk regulation and bureaucracy , some claim ; others claims that after brexit it will still be possible to participate in parts of the single market simply because we have been together for more than four decades , with the same rules .", 
                "ladies and gentlemen , none of these views seems to offer a sound basis for going forward .", 
                "the same people who argue for setting the uk free also argue that the uk should remain in some eu agencies those who claim that the uk should cherry parts of the single market must stop this contradiction .",
