                "that the market is pricing this in as a 100 % certainty is largely as a result of the expectations that have been built up in the aftermath of june 's historic brexit vote .", 
                "in essence the central bank has boxed itself into a corner , and despite recent data should really be asking itself whether it would be wise to act at all this week quite frankly it remains far too early to establish what damage has been done to the uk economy as a result of recent uncertainty irrespective of what recent pmi and confidence data tells us .", 
                "proponents of stimulus this week will no doubt argue that this week 's awful manufacturing and construction numbers mean that the bank has to act , but just because we 've seen a knee jerk plunge in consumer and business confidence does n't mean that we 'll continue to head lower .", 
                "as it is with rates already at record lows it is not immediately apparent what a further rate cut now would achieve , apart from reinforce the negativity surrounding the uk economy , which in turn could see any further measures backfire .", 
                "last week 's q2 gdp numbers show that the uk economy potentially has more scope to adopt a wait and see policy with respect to further measures given interest rates are already at record lows , and credit is freely available .",
