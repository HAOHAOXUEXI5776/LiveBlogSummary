                "president obama has insisted that he has a plan to degrade and ultimately defeat '' islamic state .", 
                "at a news conference , he set out in some detail the long-term measures that he would be taking to defeat isis , in an answer that appeared designed to repair the damage caused by his recent declaration that he did not have a strategy for defeating the islamist militants .", 
                "he spoke after john kerry , the us secretary of state , said washington was assembing a core coalition '' to defeat isis .", 
                "obama said he expected a new iraqi government to be formed next week , and that this would mark a crucial step forward .", 
                "he said he wanted to act with urgency '' , but also to do what was right .", 
                "we are going to achieve our goal .", 
                "we are going to degrade and ultimately defeat [ isis ] , the same way that we have gone after al qaeda .", 
                "you initially push them back , you systematically degrade their capabilities , you narrow their scope of action , you slowly shrink the space , the territory that they may control , you take out their leadership , and over time they are not able to conduct the same kinds of terrorist attacks as they once could .", 
                "david cameron , the uk prime minister , also said that he was committed to fighting isis over the long-term , using political and diplomatic levers as well as military ones .", 
                "at his news conference he said : my argument is you need that mixture of intelligent politics , diplomatic pressure , long-term engagement in a comprehensive plan as well as the potential for military or other more aggressive action .", 
                "this will take time , patience and resolve .", 
                "we will proceed carefully and methodically , drawing together the partners we need , above all in the region , to implement a comprehensive plan .", 
                "nato leaders have promised to press ahead with fresh sanctions against russia , despite the announcement of a ceasefire in eastern ukraine .", 
                "they welcomed this development , but only cautiously , stressing the need for russia to prove by actions , not just words , its commitment to peace .", 
                "however , the full details of sanctions have yet to be announced .", 
                "and nato leaders have said that , if the ceasefire proves robust , the new sanctions will be withdrawn .", 
                "obama said : we also sent a strong message to russia that actions have consequences .", 
                "today the united states and europe are finalising measures to deepen and broaden our sanctions across russia 's financial , energy and defense sectors with respect to the ceasefire agreement , obviously we are hopeful but based on past experience also sceptical that in fact the separatists will follow through and the russians will stop violating ukraine 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .", 
                "so it has to be tested .", 
                "doubtless because of doubts about the reliability of the ceasefire , obama and cameron resisted the temptation to claim that the ceasefire was a direct consequence of nato 's decision to beef up its anti-russia defences , through a new readiness action plan and a spearhead '' rapid reaction force .", 
                "but others may claim the two are related .", 
                "( there is a good account of the significance of the readiness action plan here . )", 
                "ukraine 's president , petro poroshenko , has welcomed the ceasefire more enthusiastically .", 
                "he stressed that it was based on his peace plan .", 
                "he said he expected all hostages held by rebel groups to be released tomorrow .", 
                "nato leaders have committed themselves to moving towards the nato target of spending 2 % of gdp on defence over 10 years .", 
                "currently only four nato members do this .", 
                "cameron claimed that this pledge was hard fought '' and that it was the first time nato leaders had actually put their signatures to an agreement saying this would happen .", 
                "( although that does n't mean much ; only last night he was haranguing nato leaders for paying ransom to terorrist groups , when some of them signed a declaration at the g8 in northern ireland last year promising not to do this . )", 
                "anders fogh rasmussen , the nato secretary general , said that the pledge had not been watered down and that using the word commitment '' in the text would have turned it into a legal obligation , which would have been problematic .", 
                "in a political world '' , the pledge was as strong as it could be , he said .", 
                "cameron has announced that the prince of wales , the second new aircraft carrier built by britain , will be brought into service .", 
                "there had been speculation that it would have to be sold off or mothballed because of budgets cuts .", 
                "obama has said that he hopes to take action on immigration reform fairly soon '' .", 
                "you can read my summary from earlier , at lunchtime , here .", 
                "that 's all from me for today .", 
                "thanks for the comments ."
