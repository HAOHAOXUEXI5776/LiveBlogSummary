                "as well as covering the bernie sanders buffalo rally live this evening , the guardian 's lauren gambino just filed this report bernie sanders campaign fired back at hillary clinton for suggesting that the guns used to commit crimes in new york flow from the senator 's vermont .", 
                "in an emailed statement , subject line : clinton misfires , sanders ' spokesman michael briggs deferred to remarks from the state 's governor , who has endorsed clinton for president .", 
                "i do n't know why secretary clinton would be so critical of the governor of vermont who strongly supports her candidacy , briggs said .", 
                "what gov [ peter ] shumlin recently said is true : \u0080\u0098it is campaign season , therefore , things are sometimes said by all the candidates that sometimes are n't entirely accurate .", 
                "i would just say this , i think you 'd have a hard time convincing vermonters that new york 's crime problems are coming from vermont . '", 
                "during a panel on gun violence prevention on monday , clinton said : most of the guns that are used in crimes and violence and killings in new york come from out of state .", 
                "and the state that has the highest per capita number of those guns that end up committing crimes in new york is vermont .", 
                "clinton has long hammered sanders for his record on guns , one of the only issues she has been able to position herself to the left of the progressive senator .", 
                "this however was the first time she has used this line of attack tying sander 's hunter-friendly home state to gun violence in new york .", 
                "clinton 's statistics come from a 2013 alcohol tobacco and firearms and explosives ( atf ) report , that found the state of vermont had the highest per-capita source of guns recovered in other states , in large part due to its small population and lax gun laws .", 
                "and according to a 2014 atf report , 55 guns found in new york to vermont , less than 1 % of the roughly 7,686 that were recovered , ( though only 4,585 of those guns were traceable to a state ) .", 
                "by comparison , 395 were traced to virginia ."
