                "coming up today we 're about to discover how britain 's economy fared in the month of the eu referendum .", 
                "the latest trade figures for june are due at 9.30am , and are expected to show that the uk ran a chunky current account deficit with the rest of the world ( as usual ) .", 
                "the gap between what britain imported and exported is tipped to widen to around \u00e2\u00a3 2.5bn in june , compared to \u00e2\u00a3 2.2bn in may .", 
                "and an industrial production report expected to show that manufacturing output fell by 0.2 % in june , following a 0.5 % decline in may .", 
                "other recent data has suggested that business confidence has taken a severe knock , but that consumers are relatively relaxed about the brexit vote , so today 's data could give new insights into the state of play .", 
                "germany is also posting trade data this morning , so we 'll be able to compare its ( traditional ) trade surplus with the uk deficit .", 
                "then at 3pm , the niesr thinktank publishes its estimate of uk growth in the may-to-july quarter .", 
                "will that show a brexit hit too ?", 
                "also coming up today the competitions and markets authority is publishing its report into uk banking reforms , outlining ways to improve customer service and help the public switch banks .", 
                "chris choi ( @ chrisitv ) competition officials today calling for `` open banking revolution '' with new apps to allow customers info to be shared securely and we 're also getting corporate news from estate agent savills , and insurer standard life ."
