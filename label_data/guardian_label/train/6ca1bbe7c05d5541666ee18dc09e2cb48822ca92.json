                "jeremy corbyn has moved to end the theatrical '' nature of prime minister 's questions by tabling a series of questions to david cameron submitted by 40,000 people who responded to his call for ideas .", 
                "as the guardian reports , the new labour leader calmly asked the prime minister in a non-confrontational way about the housing crisis in the rental sector , the government 's cuts to tax credits and mental health .", 
                "cameron , who has been thinking hard how to respond to his rival 's more consensual style , reportedly described the exchanges as different more civilised than usual '' .", 
                "the policy-heavy questioning by corbyn is likely to stabilise his position after a difficult start to his leadership when he failed to appoint any women to shadow the great offices of state and declined to sing the national anthem at the battle of britain commemoration event at st paul 's cathedral on tuesday .", 
                "cameron has said that john mcdonnell , the new shadow chancellor , should be ashamed '' of comments suggesting irish republican terrorists should be honoured .", 
                "cameron joined nigel dodds , the dup leader at wesminster , in condemning the remark made by mcdonnell in 2003 .", 
                "dodd said : the plaques at the entrance door to this chamber in memory of airey neave , robert bradford , ian gow , sir anthony berry , serving members of this house murdered by terrorists as they stood up for democracy and the british way of life .", 
                "they are a reminder of the savagery and brutality of terrorism , as are the gravestones and headstones in northern ireland and right across this land .", 
                "the opposition leader has appointed a shadow chancellor who believes terrorists should be honoured for their bravery .", 
                "will you join with all of us on all sides of this house in denouncing that sentiment and standing with us on behalf of the innocent victims and for the bravery of our armed forces who stood against the terrorists .", 
                "cameron replied : you have spoken for many , many in this house and i would say many , many , the overwhelming majority of people , the vast majority of people in our country i have a simple view which is the terrorism we faced was wrong , it was unjustifiable , the death and the killing was wrong .", 
                "it was never justified and people who seek to justify it should be ashamed of themselves .", 
                "mcdonnell said in 2003 : it 's about time we started honouring those people involved in the armed struggle .", 
                "it was the bombs and bullets and sacrifice made by the likes of [ hunger striker ] bobby sands that brought britain to the negotiating table .", 
                "the peace we have now is due to the action of the ira . ''", 
                "this week he said that he might not have chosen the right words , but that he was trying to encourage the ira that they could disarm with dignity .", 
                "corbyn 's attempt to present labour as a party committed to the full abolition of the benefits cap has been undermined by two members of his shadow cabinet who have cast doubt on the benefits of this and insisted that it is not current policy .", 
                "a shadow cabinet minister has dismissed claims that labour has been left with an economic policy that many mps do not agree with under the new leadership .", 
                "as the press assocation reports , amber rudd , the conservative energy secretary , claimed the party was now saddled '' with a new economic policy that a great swathe '' of labour 's backbenchers opposed .", 
                "but shadow environment secretary kerry mccarthy insisted the party 's policy had yet to change .", 
                "she told bbc radio 4 's world at one programme : what is our new economic policy , amber , because i certainly do n't know yet ?", 
                "there is a discussion to be had and jeremy has said it is something where he wants to involve as many people as possible .", 
                "our economic policy has not changed overnight at the moment as far i 'm concerned .", 
                "it is still the policy that we stood on in the manifesto .", 
                "labour sources have said that corbyn will sign the national anthem at future events .", 
                "they had to clarify the position after corbyn gave a non-committal answer in an interview .", 
                "( see 11.23am and 11.31am . )", 
                "the gmb union has submitted a motion to the labour conference saying the party should not support staying in the european union if employment rights are watered down as part of any membership renegotiations .", 
                "the motion says : conference furthermore confirms that the labour party will resist any attempts by the government to scale back the application of eu employment and social rights to british workers in this process , and that if eu member state governments allow cameron to remove these rights , then the labour party should not support a vote to remain in the eu .", 
                "shadow chancellor john mcdonnell will appear on question time on thursday night just days after his controversial appointment by new labour leader jeremy corbyn , it has been revealed .", 
                "theresa may , the home secretary , has said the first syrian refugees being brought to britain direct from camps in the middle east under the government 's expanded scheme to resettle only the most vulnerable are to arrive in the coming days .", 
                "the duke of wellington has been elected to sit in the house of lords , under the procedure that allows places allocated for hereditary peers to be filled by other hereditary peers not in the house , elected by hereditaries who are there .", 
                "wellington , a conservative , was one of 16 candidates .", 
                "forty one hereditary peers in the house voted , and wellington eventually won with 21 votes after a recount .",

                "but there is a serious flaw in the crowdsourcing theory ; it implies that previous opposition leaders have not bothered asking questions that might interest members of the public , and have instead simply pursued their own hobby horses .",
