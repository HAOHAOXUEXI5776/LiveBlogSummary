                "so , with that in mind , here goes economic competence with the autumn statement just two days away , these findings are not exactly very cheery for labour .",

                "respondents were asked , irrespective of which party they supported , who was best able to manage the economy properly .", 
                "the results were : theresa may and philip hammond : 48 % jeremy corbyn and john mcdonnell : 15 % icm 's director martin boon says the tory 33-point lead on this measure is even larger than it was when ed miliband and ed balls hit their low point on economic competence and found themselves 27 points behind david cameron and george osborne .", 
                "even amongst those who voted labour in 2015 corbyn and mcdonnell only have a six-point lead ( 34 % saying they would be better on the economy , compared to 28 % of those labour voters saying may and hammond would be better ) .", 
                "approval ratings here are the approval ratings from key politicians - the figure for those saying they are doing a good job , minus the figure for those saying they are doing a bad job .",

                "miliband 's approval ratings reached -39 % in june 2014 , having been only in the negative teens earlier in his leadership .", 
                "state of the parties conservatives : 42 % ( down 1 from icm for the guardian at the start of november ) labour : 28 % ( up 1 ) ukip : 11 % ( down 1 ) lib dems : 9 % ( up 1 ) greens : 3 % ( down 2 ) conservative lead : 14 points ( down 2 ) the conservative lead is down 2 from the start of this month to just '' 14 points , but that is unlikely to worry them in cchq .",
