                "boris johnson , the lead figure in the vote leave campaign , has come under strong personal attack from his tory colleague amber rudd and other remain campaigners in a sparky two-hour debate on itv .", 
                "rudd accused johnson of being motivated by personal ambition .", 
                "she said at one point : i fear that the only number that boris is interested in is the one that says no 10 .", 
                "and in her final remarks she said : he is the life and soul of the party but he is not the man you want driving you home at the end of evening .", 
                "labour 's angela eagle and the scottish first minister nicola sturgeon also accused johnson of being inaccurate and self-interested .", 
                "johnson largely let the personal attacks wash over him , and did not respond in kind .", 
                "leave sources suggested afterwards that the onslaught showed remain is rattled .", 
                "johnson has accused the remain side of scaremongering .", 
                "in his closing remarks he said : i think the last couple of hours and the whole campaign is the contrast between this side offering hope and that side offering nothing but fear about life outside .", 
                "they say we ca n't do it on our own .", 
                "we say we are a great country .", 
                "we say we can .", 
                "in his opening remarks he said that if britain voted to remain in the eu , it would stay locked in an eu of an unelected elite frankly indifferent to the suffering their policies are causing '' .", 
                "this echoes what michael gove said in his sky news interview last week about how people were supposedly suffering '' because of eu policies .", 
                "johnson has been forced to defend vote leave 's claim that eu membership costs britain \u00a3 350m a week .", 
                "commenting on the figure , sturgeon said : it is a scandal that is still emblazoned across the campaign bus because it 's an absolute whopper .", 
                "and rudd said : what is so misleading about this is the fact that being in the european union makes us money .", 
                "we 're going to repaint that bus and put a leprechaun on one end , a great big rainbow on one side and a pot of gold at the end .", 
                "because that 's all it is - pure fantasy .", 
                "eagle told johnson : get that lie off your bus . ''", 
                "but johnson said the figure was justified .", 
                "johnson has rejected claims from sir john major and tony blair that brexit could lead to the break up of britain .", 
                "he said : to the prophets of doom , i say they were wrong in the past and they are wrong today .", 
                "johnson has insisted the leave side is determined to protect the workers '' .", 
                "he said this after sturgeon quoted something he once wrote saying : the weight of employment regulation is backbreaking .", 
                "we should get rid of the collective redundancies directive , the workers ' directive , the working time directive and 1,000 more . ''", 
                "johnson has criticised david cameron for failing to get control over eu immigration in his renegotiation .", 
                "there has got to be democratic consent for the scale of the flows that we are seeing , '' johnson said .", 
                "eagle has said that labour is strongly backing remain .", 
                "she said : i have fought the tories all my life but this not a referendum on the government .", 
                "it is about the future of our country and the labour party believes passionately that our future lies in europe .", 
                "labour 's gisela stuart , who is chair of the vote leave board , has urged people to vote leave because they would not vote to join the eu as it is today .", 
                "the eu just is n't working any more .", 
                "the noble idea dreamt up in the last century is turning into a nightmare .", 
                "andrea leadsom , the pro-brexit energy minister , has rejected claims that business is opposed to brexit , saying 99 % of businesses are sme , only 6 % export to the eu and the vast majority think the uk should take back responsibility for its own trade deals '' .", 
                "that 's all from me for tonight .",
