                "he said : we are expecting the inquiry report to be ready for national security checking in the week beginning april 18 .",

                "but anyone who also managed to watch corbyn during the q & a ( which unfortunately was not carried live ) will understand why he did , because at that point he started to sound passionate and rather special .",

                "if you were expecting a deep , rich argument for remaining in the eu you will have been disappointed .", 
                "although corbyn did provide a range of reasons for voting remain , the speech sounded like a list of talking points rather than a coherent narrative with a beginning , middle and an end .", 
                "he certainly did not explain his personal journey from voting out in 1975 to voting in now , as we were told he would .", 
                "and , like a disobedient shopping trolley , he kept veering away from making the case for remaining in the eu into attacking the tories , over tax avoidance or privatisation or the like .", 
                "to be fair there is nothing wrong with a labour leader attacking the tories , and he deployed some good , waspish lines ( eg , the conservatives are loyally committed to protecting one british industry in europe - the tax avoidance industry ) , but it all sounded a bit off-message .", 
                "it was also noticeable that he made little or no attempt to engage with the arguments made by the brexit camp .", 
                "for example , there was nothing about how long it might take to negotiate free trade deal , or whether the eu would really allow the uk access to the free market without also allowing free movement .",

                "if anyone was expecting corbyn to parrot pro-eu homilies that he clearly did not believe , then they will have left disappointed .", 
                "he did not say anything inauthentic or phoney and possibly his best moment came in the q & a when an itv reporter accused him of being half-hearted .", 
                "he rebutted the claim successfully with the line : there 's nothing half-hearted about anything i do .",

                "there is a book about the 1988 us presidential election by the late richard ben cramer called what it takes which is one of the best books on politics ever written .", 
                "cramer describes how george bush was lacklustre and unfocused as a candidate , not least because he did not really seem to know why he wanted to be president , until at some point he became convinced that michael dukakis would be a disaster for america .",

                "just imagine what the tories would do to workers ' rights here in britain if we voted to leave the eu in june .",

                "it would be a tory government , quite possibly led by boris johnson and backed by nigel farage , that would negotiate the worst of all worlds : a free market free-for-all shorn of rights and protections .",
