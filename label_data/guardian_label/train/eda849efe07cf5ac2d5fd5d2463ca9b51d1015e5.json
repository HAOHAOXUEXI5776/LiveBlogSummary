                "he also leads mr shorten on eight of 11 leadership attributes .", 
                "but in many of those , the trend is negative for mr turnbull , with a 9 per cent drop in his rating as a strong leader , a 7-point drop in his ability to make things happen , and a 6-point drop in the two areas of being competent and open to ideas .",
