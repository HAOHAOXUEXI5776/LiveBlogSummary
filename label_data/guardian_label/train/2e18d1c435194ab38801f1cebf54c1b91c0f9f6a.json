                "the final scores on the european markets were : the ftse 100 finished 55.79 points or 0.92 % higher at 6152.88 , its highest leel since 31 december last year germany 's dax was up 2.34 % at 9717.16 france 's cac climbed 1.22 % to 4406.84 italy 's ftse mib rose 2.21 % to 18,011.91 spain 's ibex ended up 1.77 % at 8611.0 in greece , the athens market added 0.65 % to 520.08 on wall street , ahead of the super tuesday us delegate voting , the dow jones industrial average is currently 300 points or 1.8 % higher .",
