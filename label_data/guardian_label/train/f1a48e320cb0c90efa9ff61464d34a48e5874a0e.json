                "the state 's case south africa 's supreme court of appeal has heard arguments from state prosecutors that trial judge thokozile masipa was wrong when she found oscar pistorius not guilty of the murder of reeva steenkamp .", 
                "chief prosecutor gerrie nel told the panel of five judges that masipa had erred in her application of the legal principle of dolus eventualis , and that she was wrong to conclude that pistorius had not foreseen that firing four shots into a locked door was likely to kill or injure the person behind it .", 
                "masipa further erred in her exclusion of dolus eventualis because she accepted that pistorius believed steenkamp was in bed , nel argued : there was a criminal intent to bring about the demise of whoever was inside the toilet cubicle .",

                "nel argued that the supreme court was entitled to overturn the decision of the high court , because the finding that pistorius was guilty of culpable homicide was a de facto acquittal on the charge of murder .", 
                "neither state nor the defence has the stomach for a retrial , nel said , as he asked the appeal court to instead impose its own verdict of murder : he had defences that exclude each other \u0080\u00a6 the one he elected to use , the court rejected that one and gave him another one .", 
                "the court should have rejected his evidence as impossible \u0080\u00a6 on the objective facts , the accused can not escape a verdict of murder .",

                "roux maintained that the trial judge was correct to apply the principle of dolus eventualis to the question of whether steenkamp was in the cubicle , given that the judge had already accepted that pistorius genuinely believed there was an intruder in the bathroom , and that his girlfriend was still in bed : why would he just want to murder someone in the toilet , knowing she 's in the bedroom ?",
