                "it 's conquered hollywood , is read voraciously by teens and adults alike , and sales are still rising ; while children 's books overall were up 11 % in 2014 ( bucking the general trend in publishing ) , ya alone saw an incredible rise of 25 % .", 
                "this in spite of the fact that no one really knows precisely what it is !", 
                "but no matter ; the success of ya fiction is celebrated at yalc , the young adult literature convention set up last year as part of london 's comiccon by malorie blackman , during her stint as children 's laureate .", 
                "after all the highs of 2014 , this year 's gathering looks to be even bigger and better , with events taking on everything from new directions in dystopia to the lines dividing fantasy and reality ; from the darkest of dark themes to laugh-a-minute comedy\u0080\u00a6 there 's even going to be a yalc book club , hosted by youtube sensation carrie hope fletcher .",

                "but that is to be insensitive to the diversity and nuances that are inevitably to be found within such a broad label : books under that bracket have done much to improve the representation of lgbt characters , mental health issues , and to such as drug use and teen pregnancy , to name just a few .", 
                "ya fiction , as a whole , is uniquely proficient at traversing that infinitesimal line between the radical and the acceptable , combining responsibility for their relatively young readers with an impulse to push boundaries , challenge stereotypes , test limits .", 
                "in the last year alone , standalone novels have taken on the dark side of the internet ( bali rai 's web of darkness ) , student-teacher relationships ( me and mr j by rachel mcintyre ) and rape ( the forthcoming asking for it , by louise o'neill ) .",
