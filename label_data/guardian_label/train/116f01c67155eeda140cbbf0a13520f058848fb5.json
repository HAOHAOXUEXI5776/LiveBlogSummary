                "in another blow to the trump campaign , the former acting cia director michael morrell has endorsed hillary clinton for president and detailed his reasons for thinking donald trump would , should he fill the role , make the us less safe .", 
                "writing an op ed for the new york times , morrell first details his qualification for making such a call .", 
                "it is quite convincing : during a 33-year career at the central intelligence agency , i served presidents of both parties three republicans and three democrats .", 
                "i was at president george w bush 's side when we were attacked on september 11 ; as deputy director of the agency , i was with president obama when we killed osama bin laden in 2011 .", 
                "then he discusses his own political leanings : i am neither a registered democrat nor a registered republican .", 
                "in my 40 years of voting , i have pulled the lever for candidates of both parties .", 
                "as a government official , i have always been silent about my preference for president .", 
                "no longer .", 
                "on november 8 , i will vote for hillary clinton .", 
                "between now and then , i will do everything i can to ensure that she is elected as our 45th president .", 
                "his reasons for his decision , subsequently explained , are what you might have imagined they might be : first , mrs clinton is highly qualified to be commander in chief .", 
                "i trust she will deliver on the most important duty of a president keeping our nation safe .", 
                "second , donald j trump is not only unqualified for the job , but he may well pose a threat to our national security .", 
                "morrell then emphasises two reasons he thinks trump poses such a threat : his apparent susceptibility to and constant praise for vladimir putin of russia a career intelligence officer who morrell says , in as many words , has been playing trump like a violin and his proposed ban on muslims entering the country .", 
                "in lieu of copy-and-pasting the whole piece , which is tempting , here 's the ending : in fact , many muslim americans play critical roles in protecting our country , including the man , whom i can not identify , who ran the cia 's counterterrorism center for nearly a decade and who i believe is most responsible for keeping america safe since the september 11 attacks .", 
                "my training as an intelligence officer taught me to call it as i see it .", 
                "this is what i did for the cia .", 
                "this is what i am doing now .", 
                "our nation will be much safer with hillary clinton as president ."
