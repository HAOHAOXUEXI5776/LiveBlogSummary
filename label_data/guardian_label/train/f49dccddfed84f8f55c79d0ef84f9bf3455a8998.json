                "well hello lovely people and welcome to canberra on this monday , which is cloudy with a high probability of nonsense .", 
                "the main stories in politics early this monday are boats ( did the australian government sanction a payment to people smugglers to take asylum seekers back to indonesia ) ; the new ipsos poll ( which after a brief flirtation with a budget bounce for tony abbott has now rejoined the published polling pack ) ; and will we or wo n't we finally see new laws stripping alleged jihadists of their citizenship .", 
                "there also seems to be yet another security leak regarding the boats story this morning but more of that in a minute .", 
                "i 'll start with ipsos because we need to , of course , note it , and doing this upfront gets it out of the way so we can press on with today 's more weighty matters of state .", 
                "this morning 's poll , published by fairfax media , has labor ahead on the two-party-preferred number on 53 % to the government 's 47 % .", 
                "so all the major published polls are in alignment now , more or less .", 
                "blogans and bloganistas will remember ipsos produced the only post-budget poll that recorded a gain for the abbott government the major parties were 50/50 in a survey taken immediately after the economic statement last month .", 
                "as i noted at the time , if we look at ipsos compared with the other major opinion polls , the main measures seem more volatile than other surveys .", 
                "the may result was also out of step with every other poll in the field at the time .", 
                "looking at personal approval ratings , fairfax chief political correspondent mark kenny notes this morning that the prime minister has lost ground on preferred prime minister in this latest survey , and mr abbott 's personal approval rating has also suffered , with 40 % of voters approving of his performance compared to 54 % disapproving for a net rating of minus 14 % down 6 points since may .", 
                "mr shorten is also in negative territory but less deeply with a rating of minus 6 % down 2 since may .", 
                "there 's also a same-sex marriage question , which puts public support for marriage equality at 68 % , which from memory is similar to the recent essential poll number on this question .", 
                "as my colleague shalailah medhora reports this morning , labor will keep up the pressure on the coalition to make clear where it stands on granting a conscience vote on same-sex marriage by resuming a debate on its private member 's bill later this morning .", 
                "deputy opposition leader tanya plibersek and former government chief whip philip ruddock will each speak to the bill for five minutes during monday 's allotment for private member 's business .", 
                "so let 's sprint forward into monday .",
