                "sarah palin , the former alaska governor , said she was already sufficiently vetted to be donald trump 's running mate in the fall , in a weekend interview in which she also warned that house speaker paul ryan would pay with his career for his hesitancy on trump .", 
                "asked on cnn if she would be willing to be vetted as a possible trump veep , palin replied , i think i 'm pretty much as vetted as anybody in the country could be vetted already .", 
                "i want to help and not hurt , she added .", 
                "and i am such a realist that i realize there are a whole lot of people out there who would say anybody but palin .", 
                "palin said ryan had made a misstep in failing to fall in line behind trump .", 
                "i think paul ryan is soon to be \u0080\u0098cantored ' , as in eric cantor , she said on cnn , referring to the former house majority leader who was beaten in a 2014 primary election by a candidate running as a washington outsider .", 
                "ryan faces a heretofore little-known and under-funded rival , paul nehlen , in a primary election in wisconsin set for 9 august .", 
                "it kind of screws his chances for the 2020 presidential bid that he 's gunning for , palin said of ryan 's stance on trump , whom the house speaker will meet with thursday .", 
                "trump , meanwhile , said he did not really need ryan , and the republican party does not need to be unified for him to win , reported ed helmore : i think it would be better if it were unified , said the presumptive republican nominee in an interview with nbc 's meet the press broadcast on sunday .", 
                "and i think there would be something good about it .",

                "donald trump : i do n't need republican unity to win read more trump also stood by his suggestion that the united states could manage its debt by squeezing creditors to take less than what they 're owed .", 
                "pressed in an interview with abc 's george stephanopoulos about whether such conduct might be harmful to the full faith and credit of the united states or affect interest rates , trump said , when you can take advantage , you do that .", 
                "on cnn monday morning he added : first of all , you never have to default because you print the money .", 
                "he also reversed some of his previous ideas about taxing the rich and the minimum wage .", 
                "this week ( @ thisweekabc ) trump on plan to pay down national debt : if we can buy at a discount , that 's a great thing .",
