                "with 72.5 % of precincts reporting , the vermont senator has won the support of 79.2 % of the state 's 16 delegates , to clinton 's 20.8 % .", 
                "if the remaining precincts do n't have any massive surprises , those 16 delegates will be apportioned proportionately , letting sanders walk away from the alaska caucus with as many as 13 delegates .",
