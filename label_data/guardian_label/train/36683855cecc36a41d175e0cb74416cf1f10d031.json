                "on friday , however , japan 's nikkei rallied nearly 6 % , its biggest one-day gain in four and a half months , helped by a weaker yen and speculation that the bank of japan could unveil new stimulus measures at its meeting next week .", 
                "in europe , draghi hinted that the ecb was ready to inject fresh stimulus into the eurozone at the march meeting - sooner than many investors had been expecting .",
