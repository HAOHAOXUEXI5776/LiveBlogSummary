                "the mps - who comprise one fifth of corbyn 's party in the commons - were voting for an amendment to the queen 's speech tabled by the labour mp chuka umunna which mostly supported party policy , but said explicitly the uk should remain in the single market and in the customs union .", 
                "corbyn adopted a relatively relaxed approach when pro-european shadow ministers rebelled over article 50 earlier this year but , in a sign of how the election result has strengthened his position in the party , tonight he immediately let it be know that rebel frontbenchers would be sacked .",
