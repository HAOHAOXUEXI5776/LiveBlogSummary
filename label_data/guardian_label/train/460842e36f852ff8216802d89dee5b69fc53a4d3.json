                "the recent rate cuts and their impact has taken on more of a political flavour of late due to comments made in senate estimates yesterday by the treasury secretary john fraser .", 
                "fraser told the committee that it does worry me that the historically low level of interest rates are encouraging people to perhaps overinvest in housing .", 
                "and he further suggested that when you look at the housing price bubble evidence , it 's unequivocally the case in sydney .", 
                "with respect to other capital cities fraser suggested that a housing bubble was certainly the case in higher priced areas in melbourne .", 
                "elsewhere however he suggested the evidence was less compelling .", 
                "yesterday also came reports that monthly housing prices had fallen in sydney for the first time in 6 months .", 
                "but with a 15 % annual rise in prices in sydney , there is little suggestion that things are cooling down .", 
                "all this of course impacts on housing affordability .", 
                "the prime minister was asked yesterday about john fraser 's comments .", 
                "abbott told parliament in question time that as someone who , along with a bank , owns a house in sydney , i do hope that our housing prices are increasing .", 
                "he then clarified by saying i do want housing to be affordable , but nevertheless i also want house prices to be modestly increasing .", 
                "what is modestly increasing however ?", 
                "if that modest increase is faster than incomes then housing will not become more affordable .", 
                "in 2003 former prime minister , john howard addressed the same issue in a very similar manner .", 
                "he said at the time for people who are already in the housing market , the increase in the value of their homes has been welcome .", 
                "i do n't get people stopping me in the street and saying , \u0080\u0098john you 're outrageous , under your government the value of my house has increased ' .", 
                "the then pm concluded , in fact , most people feel more secure and feel better off because the value of their homes has gone up .", 
                "it would appear that tony abbott like john howard is definitely more concerned about home owners than those who would be thus ."
