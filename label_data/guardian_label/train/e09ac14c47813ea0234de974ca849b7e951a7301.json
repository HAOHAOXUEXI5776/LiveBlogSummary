                "as patrick wintour reports , departments have been ordered to find \u00e2\u00a3 3bn in savings , and the chancellor says he will also raise \u00e2\u00a3 1.5bn from the sale of the government 's remaining 30 % stake in royal mail .", 
                "the cuts are in addition to the \u00e2\u00a3 13bn of cuts already announced for 2015-16 and the \u00e2\u00a3 30bn of cuts osborne is due to announce in the emergency budget on 8 july for the following two years .", 
                "here is larry elliott 's analysis .", 
                "the institute for fiscal studies has warned that the government has given a misleading impression of the size of the cuts required for osborne to meet his pledge to balance the books over the next three years .", 
                "ed miliband has spoken from the backbenches of the house of commons for the first time in nine years , making an impassioned address about the need to tackle inequality .", 
                "as rowena mason reports , the former labour leader , who resigned in the wake of the party 's election defeat , made clear he had no intention of stepping away from frontline politics altogether as he took part in the queen 's speech debate on the economy .", 
                "he spoke first about his deep disappointment about labour 's loss and added that it was right that the party comprehensively examines the reasons for that defeat .",

                "but we will be very lucky if we have no global shocks hitting us , we 'll be very lucky given that we 've had five years of growth since 2010 , with only a minor blip not a recession in 2012 , another five years .",

                "he referred to a letter written by nhs england 's national medical director , sir bruce keogh , which said a confusing set of standards was leading to perverse incentives regarding the 18-week target for patients from when they are referred by their gp to when they receive treatment .",

                "these efficiency savings will be to departmental spending rather than cuts to benefits payments and are separate from the planned \u00e2\u00a3 12bn of welfare cuts , the details of which are yet to be revealed by the government .",

                "it was not clear how much money could be saved by this measure given that the social fund is not well-advertised by the dwp , and fewer loans are being given out as a result .",
