                "here are the main points from the debate .", 
                "david cameron said he wanted people to vote for a great britain in the eu , not for the little england of nigel farage '' .", 
                "i hope that when people go to vote on june 23 they think about their children and grandchildren , they think about the jobs and the opportunities they want for them , the sort of country we want to build together and they vote to say 'we do n't want the little england of nigel farage ' , we want to be great britain and we are great if we stay in these organisations and fight for the values we believe in .", 
                "he said leaving the eu could hasten the break-up of the uk .", 
                "previously he has rejected the argument that a vote to leave the eu could justify a second scottish independence referendum .", 
                "but tonight he said : you do n't strengthen your country by leading to its break-up .", 
                "nigel farage said it was worth cutting immigration even if that meant lower gdp , because there was more to life than economic growth .", 
                "he said : do you know something ?", 
                "there is more to this country , there is more about this community than just being competitive what i 'm saying is that it 's wrong , wrong , wrong for average decent people in this country their living standards are falling by about 10 % .", 
                "it 's about time we were not thinking about gdp , the rich getting richer , and think about ordinary decent people who are having a rotten time .", 
                "cameron said farage was wrong to dismiss the importance of growth .", 
                "he said : nigel farage kept on talking about 'gdp is n't all that matters ' .", 
                "gdp is the size of our economy .", 
                "it is the combination of all the wealth our country creates .", 
                "he is basically saying it does n't really matter .", 
                "he is so keen to get us out of europe that he is prepared to sacrifice jobs and growth along the way .", 
                "we must n't do that .", 
                "cameron said that the british were not quitters '' , and that they should stay in the eu .", 
                "leaving is quitting and i do n't think britain , i do n't think we are quitters , i think we are fighters .", 
                "we fight in these organisations for what we think is right .", 
                "cameron refused to say what impact the cuts to migrants ' benefits he agreed as part of his eu renegotiation would have on net migration .", 
                "asked about this , he replied : i have n't made a forecast , because frankly we have had pretty extraordinary years recently in the eu .", 
                "the first five years i was prime minister our economy created more jobs than the rest of the eu put together and so we have seen a lot of people coming to live and work here .", 
                "farage rejected justin welby 's claim that his comments about the dangers of cologne-style attacks on women were racist .", 
                "farage said : i 'm used to being demonised i 'm not going to stand and attack the archbishop of canterbury but he would have done better to read what i actually said it is a tiddly issue in this campaign .", 
                "i knew the remainers would come to me and conflate what i said .", 
                "farage criticised the pharmaceutical industry .", 
                "in response to a question from someone who worked in it , he said : i 'm not wholly happy with much of the way the pharmaceutical industry has behaved , in particular i see their lobbying in brussels which is absolutely massive and i see the way they have been very good at putting out of business people producing alternative medicine .", 
                "he said members of the establishment often only started criticising economic orthodoxy when they left their jobs .", 
                "they have been wrong before and they are wrong again .", 
                "there are strong , independent voices in business - people like john longworth from the british chambers of commerce , who resigned his position to speak out against this and people like digby jones , the former director general of the cbi .", 
                "so the trend is , if they are currently in post they support the status quo , once they have retired or resigned - the former governor of the bank of england mervyn king - they speak more freely .", 
                "he said he thought the eu would not survive .", 
                "asked about what it would be like in the future , he said : i think it 's done for .", 
                "the eurozone is a catastrophe .", 
                "the migrant crisis is dividing not just countries but within countries .", 
                "the money 's run out and yet they 're saving up for the say after our referendum an announcement about a european army .", 
                "a happy europe will be a democratic europe of sovereign nations who are good neighbours in the same street .", 
                "that 's all from me for tonight .", 
                "thanks for the comments ."
