                "however , if the economic impact on scotland is as severe as some recent market commentary has suggested , a 'yes ' vote could potentially create a market shock on a par with the recent financial crisis when house prices in scotland fell by 17.5 % , which would wipe over \u00a3 31,000 off the value of the average scottish home and \u00a3 85bn off the value of the total housing stock in scotland .",
