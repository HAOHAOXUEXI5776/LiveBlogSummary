                "following talks between greek finance minister gikas hardouvelis and his german counterpart wolfgang schauble , several greek media outlets suggested that berlin had thrown its weight behind the plan with the conservative daily , kathimerini , going so far as to announce that hardouvelis had also managed to secure approval for a precautionary credit line if all is in place by the end of the year .",
