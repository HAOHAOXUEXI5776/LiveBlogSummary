                "roger giles , who posts regular updates on the state of the ice near his home in welney , cambridgeshire , reckons there is a 70 % chance of skating by the end of the week .", 
                "i 'm damned excited , we all are , he told the guardian .", 
                "he added : a couple of more days of -5c like last night and we could be skating on the very shallow patches , so we are quite close .", 
                "you really need -8c frost at night for two or three nights to really get a good skating surface , but -5c like it was last night for three days would give us something .", 
                "fen skaters ( @ fenskaters ) today welney wash just of a1101 but the larger areas are still open water we are getting there giles is one of the senior figures in fen skating who will decide if the ice is thick enough for skating to go ahead .", 
                "three others will decide if a speed skating race meeting can be held .", 
                "he explained : malcolm robinson , dave smith and our chairman nigel blake are the big cheeses that give it the check out before we can race .", 
                "i 'm about 70 % sure that we 'll be on the ice in some shape or form .", 
                "i doubt if we 'll be racing this week , but we 'll probably have a few skaters on some of the safer patches .", 
                "the challenge will be sweeping the snow off the ice .", 
                "he said : we have boards on long sticks to push the snow off to make a 400m track , it can be quite difficult .", 
                "however , he urged wannabe skaters not to travel to the fens just yet .", 
                "everybody is getting excited and they all think they are going to jump on a train from london and get off at littleport and come and skate , but not for two or three days .", 
                "he added : you have to be careful even at welny where the water is only a few feet deep , because there are deeper ditches criss crossing the field and rivers at the edges .", 
                "so if you are not a local you could waltz up onto a river , so you 've got to be so careful .",

                "he said : one or two fen men find patches where they can practice without telling anybody else .",
