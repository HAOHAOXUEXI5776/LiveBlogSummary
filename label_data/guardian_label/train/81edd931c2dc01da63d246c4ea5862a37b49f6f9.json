                "a new survey from the royal institution of chartered surveyors has found that prices nationally have stalled over the last few months , with the number of new sales dropping .", 
                "more rics members reported a fall in new buyers last month than a rise , suggesting subdued momentum '' in the market as demand for properties cools .", 
                "sellers of the most expensive houses are also having to accept lower offers , in another sign that demand is weakening in the face of slow economic growth and political uncertainty .", 
                "here are the key points from rics ' survey : national price indicator turns flat with sentiment still downbeat in london and the south east subdued sales trends now being reported across most regions 70 % of respondents report sales prices are coming in below asking prices for homes valued at \u00a3 1m+ these charts show clearly how the market has weakened in the last few months , with sales expectations hitting the lows seen after the brexit vote and during the eurozone crisis : the report is more pessimistic than recent surveys from halifax and nationwide .", 
                "simon rubinsohn , rics chief economist , paints a pretty gloomy of the market today : the combination of the increased cost of moving , a lack of fresh stock coming to the market , uncertainly over the political climate and now an interest rate hike appears to be taking its toll on activity in the housing market .", 
                "with both buyer enquiries slipping and sales expectations also subdued , the sense is that home owners are staying put and first time purchasers are increasingly focusing on that part of the market supported by the help to buy incentive .", 
                "a stagnant second-hand market is bad news for the wider economy , not just in terms of spending but also because it restricts mobility .", 
                "more details to follow also coming up today new german trade data is being released this morning , showing how europe 's largest economy posted another surplus in september ( more on this shortly ) .",
