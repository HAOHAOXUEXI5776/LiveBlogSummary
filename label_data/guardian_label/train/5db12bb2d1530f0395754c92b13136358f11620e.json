                "here is the full text of david davis 's statement to the commons about the article 50 judgment .", 
                "but , as is often the case on these occasions , the most interesting material came in what he said in reply to mps , and in what mps said to him , not in the opening statement .", 
                "here are six things we 've learnt from the exchanges .", 
                "1 - david davis has conceded that mps and peers will be able to try to make substantive amendments to the article 50 bill .", 
                "there was much talk before today about how government lawyers would try to bombproof it by drafting it as tightly as possible to minimise the chances of mps and peers attaching amendments .", 
                "doubtless the lawyers will still be doing what they can , but davis admitted today that it would be impossible to draft a bill that would make it immune to substantive opposition amendments .", 
                "see 2.07pm .", 
                "2 - it is likely that ministers will have to agree to publish a white paper on their plans for brexit .", 
                "this is one of labour 's key demands , and it will be the subject of a labour amendment to the bill .", 
                "( it is not hard to imagine what it will look like : after \u0080\u0098give the prime minister power to invoke article 50 ' , insert \u0080\u0098subject to the pm publishing a white paper on the government 's brexit plan for debate in the house of commons ' ) .", 
                "what was striking about the exchanges this afternoon was quite how many tory mps said they also wanted a white paper .", 
                "this is from reuters ' kylie maclellan .", 
                "kylie maclellan ( @ kyliemaclellan ) if i had a pound for every time an mp has mentioned the need for a # brexit white paper during this statement , i would be quite rich by now the government only has a working majority of 16 and there are almost certainly more than eight conservatives who would vote for a white paper amendment .", 
                "there are 10 tories on the commons brexit committee and it recently published a report unanimously calling for a white paper .", 
                "theresa may will be loth to give in on this point , because the more she says now about her plans , the easier it will be to accuse her of not delivering in 2019 , but even now there may be someone in no 10 trying to work out how her 6,500-word speech can be padded out into a 30-page document that can be called a white paper .", 
                "3 - ministers will produce an article 50 bill soon but not quite as quickly as some were expecting .", 
                "davis said that the bill would be published within days .", 
                "at one stage there was speculation that ministers would rush it through the commons like emergency legislation , and there has even been talk of all-night sittings , or sittings at the weekend .", 
                "but today davis was not able to give any details of when the bill will be debated .", 
                "we will probably learn more when david lidington , the leader of the commons , gives his business statement on thursday , davis suggested .", 
                "davis also said he would allow proper time for mps to debate the bill at committee and report stage .", 
                "ministers are moving quickly , but not with the intense urgency some were expecting .", 
                "4 - ministers have abandoned the forecasts the treasury made before the referendum about the economic cost of leaving the single market and the bank of england 's andy haldane has given them the cover they need to do this .", 
                "davis revealed this in answer to a question from labour 's owen smith .", 
                "( see 1.49pm . )", 
                "this is significant because another labour demand may be for the publication of economic impact assessments about the cost of leaving the single market .", 
                "if those treasury documents do not repeat what the treasury was saying last summer , davis has provided the explanation .", 
                "5 - ministers are making an effort to show the judiciary some respect .", 
                "last year liz truss and her colleagues were criticised for not standing up for the judges behind the original article 50 ruling after they were attacked by the daily mail and others .", 
                "this morning truss issued a supportive statement .", 
                "and davis was full of praise for the supreme court , stressing its value in his opening statement and later describing its ruling as a very good judgment , a very sound judgment .", 
                "see 1.20pm .", 
                "6 - davis does not accept that appealing to the supreme court was a waste of money .", 
                "some opposition mps have been making this charge .", 
                "but davis rebutted this strongly , saying it was worth spending money on an appeal to get a definitive judgment on this point of law .", 
                "see 1.46pm .", 
                "david davis leaving no 10 before his statement today .",
