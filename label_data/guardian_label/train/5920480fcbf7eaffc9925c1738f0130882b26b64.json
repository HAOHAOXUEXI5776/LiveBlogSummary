            "text": [
                "lord mandelson 's speech this morning was focused entirely on trade .", 
                "those in favour of leaving the eu argue that britain , as the fifth largest economy in the world , would have no difficulty negotiating free trade deals with other countries if it left the eu and that , without being encumbered by the brussels bureaucracy , british trade negotiators might even be able to act more quickly than eu trade negotiators .", 
                "drawing on his experience as a former european trade commission , mandelson argued that they were wrong .", 
                "his speech went into a level of detail that most other recent speeches or articles on this topic have missed .", 
                "it probably is not for everyone , but if you are even half-interested in the eu trade argument , it is well worth reading .", 
                "here are the key points .", 
                "mandelson said it was a fantasy '' and deeply irresponsible '' to claim britain 's trade deals would be better outside the eu .", 
                "as things stand , if we genuinely want to continue embedding uk companies in global supply and value chains , and if we are genuinely serious about continuing to build the uk as a trading base for europe 's single market , there is no rational or realistic way that brexit offers a better set of global trade arrangements than those we have already .", 
                "brexiters are trying to sell people a fantasy of what life outside of the eu would look like , without any evidence to back up their assertions .", 
                "with the fate of future generations and our country 's place in the world on the ballot paper it is deeply irresponsible to pretend otherwise .", 
                "he said it was important to recognise that there was a difference between being in a single market and having a free trade agreement ( fta ) .", 
                "those in favour of leaving the eu say britain could replace being in the single market with having a free trade agreement with the eu .", 
                "but they were different things , he said .", 
                "i would describe the single market as free trade extra plus .", 
                "the extra are the common rules and regulations that matter as much as the absence of tariffs .", 
                "the plus is being part of the eu 's decision-making which gives us a big say in how these rules are made and the rights of redress when others do not obey them .", 
                "it is this extra plus that has led to a boost to the size of the economy .", 
                "the financial times cites leading economic historian nick crafts as suggesting the uk economy is a tenth larger as a result , which is many tens of thousands of jobs in britain you either accept the free movement of goods , persons , services and capital '' of the single market or you do n't and if you do n't you are outside the single market .", 
                "while brexit campaigners blur the distinction between an fta and single market access , each is distinct , with profound implications , and in this debate they must be treated as such .", 
                "he said that if britain struck a free trade deal with the eu , exporters to the eu could still end up having tariffs imposed on their goods .", 
                "complete tariff removal is not guaranteed in an fta and even a low tariff can change the calculus of a supply chain in a highly cost-sensitive global economy .", 
                "3 % on the cost of a supply chain input can be material .", 
                "and for the large volume of trade that we hope would continue , that could be a considerable sum of money .", 
                "for every uk company that trades with the eu - and there are over 200,000 - this should be a worry , as it would be for every inward investor that sets up in the uk to manufacture for onward sale into the european market .", 
                "he said he could not imagine the eu allowing the uk a full free trade deal in services .", 
                "it is implausible , for example , to think that we could get most of what we want on services , the biggest sector of the uk economy , where it is not tariffs but regulatory barriers that count .", 
                "i can not see the circumstances in which the ecb , post brexit , would allow london to continue being the centre for clearing euro-denominated trades completely outside their regulatory scope .", 
                "he said eu countries would be reluctant to offer the uk unfettered access to their markets .", 
                "the key point is that for every european economic interest with a keen stake in the british market there would be another with a competitive advantage in rolling back that british access just a bit , especially in sectors like farming and , of course , financial services , where there will be both member states and meps trying to advance the interests of frankfurt or paris at the expense of london .", 
                "continental auto manufacturers , another example , would quickly see the opportunity for them of making british producers face new tariff costs .", 
                "they would need to make a commercial judgement vis-a-vis the uk market .", 
                "but we should not assume that france , italy or spain will vote to allow vauxhall , nissan , honda , toyota and other uk-based producers tariff free access to the european market when their industries suffer from over-capacity .", 
                "yes , the german large car makers want free access to britain but they do not call all the shots .", 
                "i know from experience that in any trade negotiation defensive interests speak loudest and they are not always overcome .", 
                "it is only partly a joke to say that trade deals are launched by liberals but signed by protectionists .", 
                "he said that if britain left the eu , while some countries with eu trade deals might offer the uk the same terms , others would not .", 
                "the eu is a gateway for global market access .", 
                "outside it we lose the preferential trading benefits from its trade agreements with over 50 other countries .", 
                "it is possible that some will transfer the existing agreement to us without much fuss but others will not feel that what the uk is offering makes it worth their while .", 
                "they will make their own calculus .", 
                "overnight , following our departure , those literally hundreds of thousands of zeroed tariffs and improved conditions of market access previously negotiated by the eu in markets like korea , canada , mexico , colombia , central america , singapore , vietnam , the euromed basin and the african , caribbean and pacific countries and others would be withdrawn and replaced with the costlier , non-preferential , non-privileged market access provided to all ordinary wto members .", 
                "in some cases , that could mean new tariffs of ten , twenty percent or sometimes even more on key uk exports such as cars , machine goods , whisky and textiles .", 
                "he said if britain left the eu it would have to impose tariffs on some imports , pushing up prices .", 
                "the uk would also potentially have to raise its own tariffs on imports from these markets [ if it left the eu ] .", 
                "because , having left the eu trade framework and before the uk had replaced it through negotiations of our own , we could not continue to offer the same preferential treatment to goods entering britain under the original eu agreements .", 
                "this is because we would be breaking wto rules which require , outside preferential agreements , treating all fellow wto members the same , without discrimination .", 
                "so one of the first acts of a uk outside of the eu would actually be to increase border protection because we are no longer covered by eu agreements , raising the cost of imported goods and consumer prices .", 
                "he said negotiating trade deals with countries outside the eu would be harder than some brexit campaigners think .", 
                "yes , we could try to negotiate duplicate agreements with korea and others .", 
                "i do n't know how many of you have had the pleasure of negotiating with the koreans , but i have .", 
                "they are charming - but utterly tough .", 
                "we would have to persuade them to offer the same terms as they offered the eu - but with less leverage .", 
                "he said britain had a shortage of trade negotiators , which was an added problem .", 
                "and there is a practical problem here too .", 
                "after our years in the eu , the uk has no real trade negotiating capacity - it would first have to be rebuilt .", 
                "if we left , the uk would be ill equipped to re-build the status quo let alone forge new agreements which some imagine are within our grasp .", 
                "he said norway used to ask him , as eu 's trade commissioner , to represent its interests in trade talks .", 
                "we must not fall into the trap of confusing britain 's genuine cultural and soft power influence with weight at the trade negotiating table .", 
                "how often do i remember the norwegian foreign minister grabbing my arm as i went into trade negotiations asking me to represent his country 's interests because norway did not have a seat at the negotiating table .", 
                "he ridiculed boris johnson for comparing himself to james bond in relation to his eu stance .", 
                "it would be thoroughly reckless for britain to sacrifice the settled network of trade advantages and preferences we have built up over decades , just for the thrill of a dare devil race round the international circuit in our own aston martin , as boris aspires to .", 
                "he was referring to a line johnson used in an interview with the times at the weekend .",
