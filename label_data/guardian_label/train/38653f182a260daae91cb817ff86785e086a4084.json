                "there were various options , she suggested .", 
                "the point i would make , and it 's quite a fundamental point , is we are in unchartered territory here .", 
                "article 50 is the only rule that exists for what happens now .", 
                "no country was every expected to ever want to leave the eu .", 
                "so to some extent the uk as a whole is sitting with a blank sheet of paper .", 
                "there is an ability to be creative , and to look at different options that respect how different parts of the uk voted .", 
                "i think there are ways in which that can be done .", 
                "i do n't pretend , and i have never since the referendum pretended , that it will be straightforward or without challenges .", 
                "and maybe we will find that none of these ways are possible , and that independence is the only option for scotland to pursue .", 
                "but we will try very hard to put other options on the table .", 
                "sturgeon did not give details about what these options might be .", 
                "but she played down the suggestion that she might want to see a customs border go up between england and scotland .", 
                "she said the uk government was opposed to having a hard border between ireland and northern ireland , and so she did not see the case for erecting one between england and scotland .", 
                "she also hinted that iceland might be a possible model .",

                "emphatically yes .", 
                "she said she wanted to keep scotland in the single market .",

                "she said the debate about independence had changed since 2014 because brexit had changed the balance of economic risk .", 
                "the uk we voted to stay part of in 2014 is not the uk we now face the prospect of .", 
                "sturgeon said she accepted that the fall in the oil price created difficult questions for those backing scottish independence .", 
                "but she went on : i absolutely accept that if scotland is in another independence debate then there will be hard economic questions that will be asked that i and those advocating independence have a responsibility to answer .", 
                "but this debate has changed since 2014 .", 
                "in 2014 those who argued against independence said it was about the economic certainty and stabililty of the uk versus the uncertainty of independence .", 
                "what we have now in the uk , particularly if it comes out of the single market , is instability and uncertainty and lost economic growth .",

                "her main speech to the conference will take place tomorrow afternoon but , just as theresa may chose to give two speeches to her party conference , a brexit one at the start and a domestic policy one at the end , sturgeon opened the conference yesterday with a speech about brexit and scottish independence .",

                "nicola sturgeon warned that she was prepared to stage a second scottish independence referendum before the uk quits the european union as she attacked the tories for their xenophobic '' rhetoric on the eu .", 
                "in a clear challenge to theresa may 's government in london , the first minister told the scottish national party conference in glasgow she would unveil draft legislation next week to prepare for a rerun of the 2014 referendum within the next two years .", 
                "sturgeon said the uk government 's recent rhetoric on capping immigration and on quitting the eu single market made it clear that the tory party had been taken over by its rampant and xenophobic '' right wing .", 
                "to applause from delegates , sturgeon singled out the prime minister and declared : hear this : if you think for one single second that i 'm not serious about doing what it takes to protect scotland 's interests , then think again . ''", 
                "her official spokesman cautioned that this was designed to give the scottish government the full range of options .", 
                "sturgeon had a dual-track strategy and her immediate goal was to get the strongest powers possible for holyrood in the brexit deal .",
