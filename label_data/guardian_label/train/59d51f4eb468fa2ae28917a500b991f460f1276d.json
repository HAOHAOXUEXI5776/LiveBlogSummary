                "there has been , as peter dutton acknowledged on tuesday night , a strategic and phased campaign of backbenchers speaking out about the shortcomings of tony abbott but more particularly his policies .", 
                "the dissenters in just the past two days include mal brough , dennis jensen , andrew laming , teresa gambaro , warren entsch and latterly , arthur sinodinos and luke howarth .", 
                "queensland mp , luke howarth , said abbott had shown he was willing to listen and he needs some more time to turn things around .", 
                "but if the polls did not improve the prime minister would need to make a leadership call about what was in the best interests of the country and the coalition .",

                "though discredited , and having lost his cabinet position over icac investigations yet to conclude , sinodinos still has good links in the party .", 
                "most particularly to john howard .", 
                "also today , we saw the intervention of former victorian jeff kennett who agreed with the dissident backbenchers that abbott 's leadership was terminal .", 
                "asked if the liberal party 's base was moving away from abbott , kennett told the abc : there 's no question about that whatsoever , and i 'd go further and say it has moved away , as has the public support .", 
                "kennett 's intervention was interesting , coming days after a column written by former treasurer peter costello , who was deeply critical of abbott 's prince philip decision and the consultation processes of his government .", 
                "given their history , the chances of costello and kennett agreeing on anything are practically zero .", 
                "when they agree to bag out a leader - that has to be dangerous .", 
                "add to that sinodinos , who is so well connected in the nsw liberal party machine as well as the obvious feeling in queensland following the state election and you have most of the country covered .", 
                "christopher pyne was interesting to watch , as always .", 
                "he enunciated julie bishop 's crankiness over being challenged by abbott over her loyalty .", 
                "pyne also suggested tweeted reports were wrong that malcolm turnbull was canvassing support .", 
                "pyne said he asked turnbull point blank .", 
                "turnbull said no , he was not .", 
                "so where we stand tonight is that there is a mood for change but no one can see a mechanism .", 
                "mostly because - a bit like costello 's thwarted ambitions - at this stage the contenders are too polite to challenge .", 
                "and finally , here is what we know about the mechanism required - if the party room lose their manners at the regular meeting expected on tuesday .",
