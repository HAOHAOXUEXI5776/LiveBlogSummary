                "macdiarmid/getty images hot off the digital press , here 's the guardian 's news story on the new crisis at tesco , by my colleagues zoe wood and sean farrell : tesco has been plunged deeper into crisis after it was forced to suspend four senior executives and call in investigators following the discovery that its profits had been artificially inflated by \u00e2\u00a3 250m .", 
                "more than \u00e2\u00a3 2bn was wiped off the value of britain 's biggest retailer on monday after its new chief executive told the city that forensic accountants and lawyers had been drafted in to scrutinise its books in the wake of a warning from a whistleblower that payments from suppliers were being misbooked and business costs were being glossed over .", 
                "tesco said the changes had misleadingly boosted profits by \u00e2\u00a3 250m in the first six months of the year .", 
                "the retailer , which banked \u00e2\u00a3 1.6bn profit in the first six months of 2013 , is now expected to make half that this year .", 
                "the seriousness of the situation meant the figure could fall further still .", 
                "one of the four men suspended was chris bush , the most senior executive outside the tesco boardroom as the manager who oversees its uk operations , which rang up sales of \u00e2\u00a3 48bn last year .", 
                "we have uncovered a serious issue and have responded accordingly , said tesco 's chief executive , dave lewis , who admitted he did not yet know whether the practice had been going on for some time .", 
                "there were reports that senior staff at what is the uk 's largest private-sector employer had been asked to hand in company laptops and phones as the inquiry , led by the accountancy firm deloitte and law firm freshfields , got under way .", 
                "lewis , who has been running tesco for just three weeks after his predecessor , phil clarke , was axed amid a sales slump , said the matter had also been reported to the financial conduct authority .", 
                "the regulator has the power to prosecute those who make deliberately or recklessly misleading statements to the stock exchange .", 
                "the company has also been forced to take the unprecedented step of delaying reporting its half-year results to the city by three weeks .", 
                "tesco refused to name the individuals at the centre of the investigation but they are understood to be bush , who has worked for tesco for 32 years , his number two , carl rogberg , john scouler , its commercial director , and matt simister , head of group sourcing click here for the full story : tesco loses \u00e2\u00a3 2bn in value as profit overstatement investigation begins .",

                "and that 's all for tonight .", 
                "my early-evening summary at 5.55pm bst has the key points , analyst reaction and share price plunge information .", 
                "and the rest of today 's liveblog is packed with details , analysis and reaction of how tesco 's day to forget began .", 
                "it started with the shock announcement at 7am , followed by a bruising conference call with reporters ; continued by a swathe of criticism from city analysts , leading to \u00e2\u00a3 2bn being wiped off its value as its shares slumped 11.5 % .", 
                "fitch 's decision to put tesco on rating watch negative rounded off an awful day for tesco , as shareholders begin to demand answers and war on want warns that a new price war could be devastating for food suppliers .",
