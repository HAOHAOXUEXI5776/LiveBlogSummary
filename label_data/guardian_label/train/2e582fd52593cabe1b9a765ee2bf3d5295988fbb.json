                "the innovation minister christopher pyne wondered who had the profoundly daft idea of a gst increase given that would mean poor people paid more in tax and rich people paid less in tax , which did n't on the face of it , sound that politically saleable .",

                "apart from the mildly chaotic and periodically passive aggressive route of the gst hike bus , the prime minister was moved to ask his departmental head whether or not one of his ministers , stuart robert , may have acquired a slight compliance problem with the ministerial code of conduct when he went on a holiday with a party donor paul marks which , strangely , involved him appearing at an official function in china , which chinese officials evidently thought was an official appearance given robert was a minister in the australian government , not a tourist who had accidentally wandered into the wrong venue .",
