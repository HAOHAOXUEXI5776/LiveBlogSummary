                "today there 's a lot of discussion over whether bernie sanders needs to drop out asap to create party unity against donald trump , or if hillary clinton is being hypocritical for wanting him to withdraw , since she did n't back in 2008 when it was clear she was losing but had some momentum behind her .", 
                "after clinton 's chat with cnn yesterday , where she declared she will be the democratic nominee , the conversation has become even more focused on what should sanders do now .", 
                "msnbc political correspondent steve kornacki just tweeted his take on the sanders v clinton battle : steve kornacki ( @ stevekornacki ) i guess i should just put my thoughts on the dem race in one place and it 's true that looking back in 08 shows a lot of criticism of clinton 's scorched-earth policy from the time : taniel ( @ taniel ) 2016 , in wapo : `` sanders 's scorched-earth campaign is a gift to trump '' 2-sec googling : over at slate , jamelle bouie criticized sanders for focusing on the rules around elections rather than what happens if trump wins .", 
                "sanders is attacking the coalition that elected barack obamathe coalition that arguably made his progressive movement possible whether he realizes it or not .", 
                "this coalition is predominantly nonwhite , centered in black and latino communities , and it 's the reason clinton stands as the likely nominee .", 
                "these voters have enabled liberals to , for the first time , craft a national coalition that does n't have to shy from questions of racial justice and gender equality , or like the democratic party of bill clinton acquiesce in the face of white backlash , subsuming nonwhite concerns to the anxieties of white voters .", 
                "and critically , these voters are among those americans with the most to lose if sanders decides that his shot at the nomination or at changing debate and primary rules is more important than keeping donald trump from the white house .", 
                "and all of this is counterproductive to his stated goal of pulling the democratic party to the left .", 
                "eugene robinson at the washington post says that he backs sanders political philosophies , but if he stays in the race it just helps trump : instead of accepting this obvious fact , the sanders campaign is behaving like a 2-year-old who ca n't have ice cream for breakfast .", 
                "all along , sanders and his aides have claimed that the party establishment was unfairly tipping the scales in favor of clinton .", 
                "now the sanders people have gone further and are deliberately stoking anger and a sense of grievance less against clinton than the party itself .", 
                "this is reckless in the extreme , and it could put trump in the white house .", 
                "what do you think of the position sanders is in ?", 
                "should he keep battling it out to the convention ?", 
                "let us know in the comments ."
