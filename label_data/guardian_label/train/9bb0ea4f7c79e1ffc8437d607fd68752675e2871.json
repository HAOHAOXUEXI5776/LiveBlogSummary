                "the brexit negotiations are in a very disturbing state of deadlock '' over britain 's divorce bill but decisive progress before christmas is still within reach , michel barnier , the eu 's chief negotiator , has said .", 
                "jeremy corbyn has said he would vote to remain in the eu in the event of another referendum , as he criticised the government for its shocking '' lack of progress in the brexit talks .", 
                "britain 's hopes of securing the continued right of a million british citizens currently in europe to live anywhere in the eu after brexit is being thwarted by the bloc 's refusal to engage with proposals from london , according to sources close to the negotiations .", 
                "the treasury has said that ministers will be allowed to spend money preparing for brexit before they have had normal parliamentary approval .", 
                "in a written ministerial statement liz truss , the chief secretary to the treasury , said that delaying spend until legislation has reached royal assent could jeopardise readiness for brexit '' and that as a result ministers will be told they can use a technical direction '' to authorise spending some of the \u00a3 250m that has been allocated for this purpose .", 
                "andrea leadsom , the leader of the commons , has said that ministers need more time before they can bring the eu withdrawal bill back to the commons for its committee stage line-by-line scrutiny .",

                "eight days have been set aside for the committee stage .", 
                "but , when leadsom announced the commons business for next week , the bill was not included .", 
                "she explained : what i can say to all members is of course , there are some 300 amendments and 54 new clauses being proposed , quite rightly , by members who have very real concerns about the bill .", 
                "those are being closely evaluated .", 
                "that is taking a bit of time to have proper , thoughtful , well considered responses to those .",

                "millions of draughty homes in england and wales will be insulated and overhauled by 2035 to save families as much as \u00a3 300 a year on their energy bills , under the government 's climate change plans , it emerged today .",
