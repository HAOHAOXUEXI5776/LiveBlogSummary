                "the clinton campaign has accused fbi director james comey of jaw-dropping double standards for releasing news of a fresh investigation into hillary clinton 's private email server while apparently withholding evidence of russian support for donald trump in case it were to influence next week 's election .", 
                "clinton 's spokespeople pointed to reports by cnbc and the huffington post claiming that comey privately urged against naming russia for apparently interfering in the election and hacking democratic email accounts , with campaign manager robby mook saying the decision to hold back defied all logic .", 
                "the white house also aired more tentatively-worded concerns about comey 's actions and motivations ; while the guardian reported that the fbi director could himself face investigation for violating the hatch act , a law designed to prevent federal officeholders from abusing their power to influence an election .",

                "mother jones cited unnamed sources not verified by the guardian to claim that trump has been cultivated by russia as its preferred candidate .", 
                "the new york times had a look at what can be seen of trump 's tax records he 's chosen not to release them , of course and concluded that measures he took in the early 1990s were so legally dubious his own lawyers advised him that the internal revenue service would likely declare it improper if he were audited .", 
                "and nbc reported that the fbi has opened an inquiry into paul manafort , trump 's former campaign manager , in relation to his role in advising foreign politicians , including ukraine 's viktor yanukovych .",

                "director comey ensured that the fbi would not be part of letting the american people know that the kremlin was behind a direct effort to undermine our democracy , mook alleged , calling the difference in comey 's treatment of the russian hacking of dnc email servers and the discovery of emails potentially related to clinton 's use of private servers alarming and disturbing .", 
                "donald trump , mook continued , used the ambiguous language of comey 's letter to congressional leaders as an opportunity to wildly speculate and lie about the fbi re-opening the case against clinton , while the fbi kept mum about russian involvement in hacking the democratic party .", 
                "the fbi had apparently agreed to the same conclusion by 17 intelligence agencies more than a month before the election that russia was behind this attack , mook said , yet comey has no problem depriving information to the american people .", 
                "it 's impossible to view this as anything less than a blatant double-standard , mook continued .", 
                "these are not the hallmarks of a responsible investigation the fbi had not even obtained access to review emails for any potential significance , and yet director comey insisted on revealing the agency 's discovering to congressional leadership , creating a firestorm just days before the election .", 
                "i am calling on director to immediately explain this incongruence and apply the same standard to donald trump 's associates as he has applied to hillary clinton 's , mook concluded .", 
                "chiming in , fallon alleged that this report suggests that comey feels compelled to make disclosures about emails that he has not even read but is insisting on russian cyberattacks that he agreed was directed at our democracy .", 
                "it is not fair for him to stay silent about investigations into election-related hacks .",

                "anwering questions from journalists on the call , mook called comey 's lack of further information regarding the case particularly frustrating for the campaign , and fallon accused comey of narrating a play-by-play of the fbi investigation in clinton without doing the same thing for the russian hacking ."
