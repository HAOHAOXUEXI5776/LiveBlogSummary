                "and i set out what mcdonnell said about labour 's three priorities for the budget here .", 
                "but the speech also contained some interesting proposals relating to nhs funding .", 
                "here are the key points .", 
                "mcdonnell said that an independent body should be given the job of deciding how much funding the nhs needs .", 
                "he said the office for budget responsibility could do this job if the law was changed , but he suggested that a new body should be set up to do this job .", 
                "the financing of the nhs has become excessively politicised to the point where even supposedly official figures are subject to dispute .", 
                "there needs to be an independent adjudication of both needs , and actual provision , to restore public trust and confidence .", 
                "the office for budget responsibility has already taken steps to assess the levels of funding needed for the nhs in the longer term .", 
                "i have written to robert chote to ask about the ability of the obr to continue to provide these assessments , as part of its overall brief to monitor the government 's fiscal position .", 
                "to change the obr 's responsibilities and bring in permanent oversight on healthcare funding would require primary legislation from government .", 
                "fair and objective assessments of long-term need are required , along with close monitoring of actual spend being made .", 
                "that 's a bigger task than ministers can provide .", 
                "we need a political neutral body , modelled on the office for budget responsibility , that can remove the question of long-term funding from the political squabbling .", 
                "only in this way can public confidence in the figures be restored - and essential spending correctly made .", 
                "he said the government should move towards giving the nhs a 10-year funding settlement .", 
                "as lord macpherson [ the former treasury permanent secretary ] and others have suggested , placing the nhs on a stable five-year financing basis means that certainty of funding can be assured .", 
                "but we need to do more than tie funding down for the length of a parliament and look to ten-year budgets .", 
                "he said he supported more hypothecation for health spending .", 
                "( hypothecation involves allocating tax revenue for a specific purpose . )", 
                "mcdonnell said : people need to know that the contribution they make will be spent properly .", 
                "hypothecation , allocating taxes raised to specific purposes , can make absolutely clear where tax money is being spent .", 
                "it can help restore the trust and confidence in taxation and government spending that has otherwise started to break down .", 
                "but hypothecation for the nhs has to be more than a commitment from a politician or a political party to spend a given amount , however firm that promise .", 
                "it needs a clear commitment , over the long term , that specific taxes will be used for specific purposes , and that this spending will be properly monitored .", 
                "this is also a plan that has been provisionally backed by lord macpherson , despite the treasury 's traditional objection to hypothecation .", 
                "in a submission to a lords select committee inquiry into nhs funding published in november last year macpherson said : i see considerable benefits in a fixed five year budget for health spending : indeed , it is arguable that that is the status quo , subject to the government reintroducing end year flexibility '' .", 
                "in my view , hypothecation merits further examination .", 
                "moving to full hypothecation '' of nics to health spending would be challenging .", 
                "but it is the only form of hypothecation which would give taxpayers complete assurance about where the national insurance they paid was going .", 
                "it is the option most likely to legitimise a tax funded increase in health spending .",
