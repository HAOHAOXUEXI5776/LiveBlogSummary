                "alongside the general reversal of yesterday 's losses the ftse also benefited from brent crude 's slight rise ; the black stuff is now tickling $ 52 per barrel having slipped under $ 51.50 on tuesday , allowing bp and shell to pull back from yesterday 's lows .", 
                "over in the eurozone the situation was much the same , with the dax and cac climbing 0.5 % to 0.6 % apiece .",

                "in its global macroeconomic outlook it said the eurozone is expected to grow by 2.1 % in 2017 and 1.9 % in 2018 compared to 1.7 % last year .", 
                "robust survey indicators in euro area countries suggest that growth should accelerate through the rest of the year , while the consumer confidence indicator at a 16-year high bodes well for the consumer-driven recovery , '' said madhavi bokil , a vice president at moody 's and author of the report .", 
                "in detail it says : moody 's has revised up germany 's gdp growth forecasts to 2.2 % and 2.0 % for 2017 and 2018 respectively .", 
                "similarly , moody 's has raised its forecasts for france to 1.6 % for both 2017 and 2018 , from 1.3 % and 1.4 % as the recovery remains on track , driven by net exports and investment .", 
                "in italy , moody 's expects that the recovery will also continue to benefit from supportive monetary and fiscal policies , as well as stronger growth in the rest of the european union .", 
                "moody 's has revised up its real gdp growth forecast to 1.3 % in 2017 and 2018 from 0.8 % and 1 % respectively .", 
                "g20 economies will collectively grow at an annual rate of slightly more than 3 % in 2017 and 2018 , higher than last year 's 2.6 % .", 
                "with considerable slack remaining in some euro area economies and some emerging market countries , the current pace of growth around 2 % in advanced economies and more than 5 % in emerging markets is not only sustainable in the near term , there is potential for upside .", 
                "as for the us : moody 's expects us growth of 2.2 % in 2017 and 2.3 % in 2018 , down from 2.4 % and 2.5 % , respectively .", 
                "the revisions in 2017 are a result of weaker performance in the first half of the year .", 
                "the lower growth forecast for 2018 reflects expectations of a more modest fiscal stimulus than previously assumed .", 
                "on actions by central banks , moody 's says : monetary policy in the us should continue to tighten this year and next .", 
                "moody 's also expects euro area monetary policy to become less supportive in 2018 , provided that the current growth momentum remains intact .", 
                "the bank of japan 's policy stance will likely become less accommodative once the 2 % inflation target is reached , which the central bank expects in 2019 .", 
                "but it warned there were a number of risks , not least the situation with north korea : a significant escalation of any of the situations in korea , the south china sea and other areas could have significant negative credit implications for the global economy , '' said elena duggar , an associate managing director at moody 's .",
