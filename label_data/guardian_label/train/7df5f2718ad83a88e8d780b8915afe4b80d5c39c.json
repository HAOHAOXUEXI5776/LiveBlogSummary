                "despite the reluctance of other eu leaders to prioritise greece in a summit scheduled to deal with issues including ukraine and the libya crisis , the prime minister was granted a special meeting with germany 's chancellor , angela merkel , mario draghi , the president of the european central bank , the french president , fran\u00e3\u00a7ois hollande , donald tusk of poland , who chairs the summits , and jeroen dijsselbloem , the dutch finance minister who heads the eurogroup of finance ministers .", 
                "both sides , merkel and draghi on the one hand and tsipras on the other , went into the talks with little sign of a shift in their respective stances .",

                "unsuccessful and bad-tempered meetings this week between the two sides in athens have left greece looking isolated .", 
                "tsipras pushed two bills through parliament on wednesday granting relief in the form of food stamps and free electricity to those hardest hit by the savage austerity of the past five years .", 
                "eurozone officials complained that this should not have happened without their blessing , accusing tsipras of unilateral action .", 
                "he responded robustly , arguing that the days of greece taking orders from its creditors were over and that he was asserting greece 's economic and political sovereignty .", 
                "the decision to interrupt the summit to enable a smaller-format negotiation with tsipras also ruffled feathers among eurozone creditors not taking part in the talks .", 
                "i 'm angry , said charles michel , the belgian prime minister .",
