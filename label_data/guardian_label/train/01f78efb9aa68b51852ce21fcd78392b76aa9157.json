                "here is a full summary of the number 10 lobby briefing .", 
                "downing street said britons were not getting special treatment in relation to the us travel ban .", 
                "he said the foreign office statement last night about how the new us rules affected dual nationals was not intended to mean that british dual nationals were getting preferential treatment .", 
                "it was meant to be a clarification of how the rules affected dual nationals generally .", 
                "he said he could not comment on the new statement issued by the american embassy this morning because he had not seen it .", 
                "( see 12.01pm . )", 
                "the spokesman confirmed that britain did not agree with president trump 's move .", 
                "we disagree with these restrictions , the spokesman said .", 
                "he said that statement covered all aspects of the trump travel ban .", 
                "we do n't agree with these restrictions , it is not the way we would do it .", 
                "where people 's rights , uk citizens ' rights , have been affected , we have set about getting a clarification to allow them to travel .", 
                "as we pointed out last week , where we disagree with something we are happy to say we disagree with it .", 
                "the spokesman said that the decision to invite trump to the uk for a state visit was first taken by the state visit committee that operates in the foreign office .", 
                "asked why trump was being offered a state visit so soon , when previous presidents have had to wait months or years for an equivalent invitation , the spokesman said said : there is no set timing that a president needs to be in office before they receive , or do n't receive , an invitation for a state visit .", 
                "there is a process for state visits .", 
                "each year the government looks at the recommendations that are made by the committee for state visits , those recommendations are then put to buckingham palace , the palace then needs to agree to the visit , then , historically the invitation is extended on behalf of her majesty by the government , and that is the process that took place this time .", 
                "but the spokesman was unable to say who sits on the committee , or to explain why trump received his invitation within a week of taking office .", 
                "( very few observers will believe that trump got the invitation just because an obscure committee came up with the idea .", 
                "ultimately these decisions are taken by number 10 , and may clearly offered trump a visit quickly because he appears to want one desperately and she thought this would help to improve a relationship that has become particularly important in the light of brexit . )", 
                "the spokesman also dismissed the prospect of the invitation being withdrawn .", 
                "the invitation has been extended and it has been accepted .", 
                "the uk and the us have a very strong , close relationship and it is right that we continue to work together .", 
                "the spokesman said it was up to parliament to decide whether the petition saying donald trump should not be invited to the uk for a state visit should be debated .", 
                "the petition has received more than 1m signatures , and petitions getting more than 100,000 signatures are normally considered for debate .", 
                "but by convention the commons does not normally debate matters relating to the queen , and so it is likely that this may never get debated .", 
                "asked if the prime minister would like to see this debated in parliament , the spokesman said this was a matter for parliament .", 
                "the spokesman said the planned white paper on brexit would be published as soon as possible , but he refused to say when .", 
                "may is travelling to dublin after the joint ministerial committee meeting in cardiff for talks with the irish prime minister , enda kenny .",
