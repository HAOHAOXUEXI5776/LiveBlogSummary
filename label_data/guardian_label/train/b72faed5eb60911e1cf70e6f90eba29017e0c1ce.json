                "it fell as low as $ 1.1983 in asian trading before recovering some ground .", 
                "it is currently down 1.45 % at $ 1.2002 , while against the euro it has fallen 1.24 % to \u20ac1.1312 .",

                "but with the weak pound one of the driving forces behind the rise of the ftse 100 to record levels , since it boosts the business of overseas earners , markets are expected to open higher .", 
                "michael hewson , chief market analyst at cmc markets uk , said : the weakness of the pound has been one of the key catalysts as to why the ftse100 has managed to push strongly above its previous all-time highs , as well managing to break record after record in closing higher every day since just before christmas .", 
                "this pattern looks set to continue again , with a higher open for the uk benchmark , as we head into a new week after the pound fell below the 1.2000 level for the first time since the flash crash lows in october last year in asia overnight .", 
                "it would appear that the main catalyst behind this sell-off is speculation that uk prime minister theresa may will set out tomorrow the uk government 's position when it comes to coming to deal with the eu with respect to its negotiation position ahead of the expected triggering of article 50 in march , though this could still be derailed by the supreme court ruling which is due any day now .", 
                "the expectation is that the prime minister 's insistence on being able to better control immigration as well as the uk 's law making , will result in the uk announcing its intention to leave the single market and customs union , which most investors appear to assign as being exceedingly negative for the pound .",
