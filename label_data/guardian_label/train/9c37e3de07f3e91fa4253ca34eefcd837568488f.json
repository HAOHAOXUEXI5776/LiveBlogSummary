                "pmqs - verdict : jeremy corbyn should not be too worried by that - because it could have been a lot worse .",

                "and this made it slightly tricky for david cameron , who was clearly itching to attack .", 
                "in his third answer , when corbyn was still being relatively gentlemanly , cameron unleashed a sly but rather pointed jibe about politicians not being able to dodge forever '' a decision about confronting islamic state .", 
                "he then delivered some routine attack lines about economic competence before , right at the end , coming out with the most effective line of the exchanges , the one about the police needing the power to shoot to kill '' .", 
                "has n't it come to something when the leader of the opposition thinks that the police , when confronted by a kalashnikov-waving terrorist is n't sure what the reaction should be ?", 
                "as i said earlier , this may sound a bit unfair , but jeremy corbyn only has himself to blame for getting himself into the position where cameron can de him as someone who would dither about authorising force even while gunmen were running amok .", 
                "perhaps , when corbyn answered laura kuenssberg 's question about this on the bbc on monday ( details here ) , the labour leader was thinking of suspect bombers ( like the one jean charles de menezes was n't ) being assassinated not gun-wielding jihadis .", 
                "this is conceivable , although it would have been odd for corbyn not to realise what he was being asked given that he was being interviewed about the paris attacks .", 
                "corbyn subsequently clarified his stance yesterday .", 
                "but on monday night , according to at least one account , corbyn was not prepared to tell the plp that he would approve of shoot to kill '' in cameron 's kalashnikov-waving terrorist '' scenario .", 
                "if you are finding this subject tedious already , then i 'm afraid i 've got bad news ; cameron is likely to keep at this for as long as corbyn leads labour .", 
                "but , in the circumstances , corbyn got off lightly .", 
                "just imagine the fun cameron could have had with today 's ken livingstone shambles .", 
                "( corbyn , to his credit , has said livingstone should apologise , but cameron could have challenged corbyn to sack him from the defence review if he does n't say sorry . )", 
                "partly corbyn limited the damage by playing a defensive game ; by asking neutral or relatively restrained questions , he made it harder for cameron to attack him .", 
                "but why did n't he ask the jonathan reynolds question ( see 12.23pm ) which was superb ?", 
                "and a more effective opposition leader would have found it hard to lose by asking about the latest health spending warnings ."
