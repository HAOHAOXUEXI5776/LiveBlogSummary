                "sarwar , the erstwhile frontrunner for the post but regarded by left-wingers as too centrist , was one of 13 msps to sign a letter last year urging corbyn to consider standing down .", 
                "sarwar and the corbyn grouping at holyrood have since made their peace , but the leadership contest is breaking down into another power struggle between the corbyn camp and labour 's centrists which has its implications too for control of its national executive .", 
                "the scottish leader has an automatic seat on the nec , as well as controlling scottish selection procedures and policy - changes which dugdale fought for and won .",

                "i do n't know which planet they 're on but we are in a position where we ca n't afford the luxury of that kind of disunity .", 
                "in his opening remarks , leonard might also have been tilting at a controversy over wages at sarwar 's family business , united wholesale ( scotland ) , when he railed against widespread poverty in glasgow .", 
                "set up by his father mohammad sarwar , the uk 's first muslim mp , it only pays the legal minimum wage of \u00a3 7.45 an hour , not the living wage of \u00a3 8.45 which sarwar supports or the \u00a3 10 an hour that corbyn wants introduced .", 
                "arguing competition in its sector is too fierce , uws refuses to voluntarily raise its rates .", 
                "leonard said : what work there is is all too often precarious , short term , agency and zero hours with one in five glasgow workers earning less than the living wage of \u00a3 8.45 an hour .", 
                "sarwar insists he is a minority shareholder and has no directorships or control over company policy , but the attack is sticking .",

                "as expected , leonard is attracting all the union support so far , with the highly powerful unite union joining the rail unions aslef and tssa in backing him yesterday .", 
                "leonard won the strongest , most consistent applause at the event but sarwar showed greater subtlety and adopted softer tones in his answers on policy questions ; leonard 's voice was stuck in rally mode .", 
                "he also lost on a few key policy points to sarwar , failing to confirm at one point that , unlike sarwar , he supported above inflation pay rises for nurses .", 
                "it remains unclear whether scottish labour members will be swayed by leonard 's passionate defence of corbyn .", 
                "scottish fully-paid-up members voted for corbyn 's rival owen smith last year , by 6,856 to 6,042 for corbyn , although corbyn 's scottish supporters insist that was cancelled out by a majority of scottish affiliates and registered members who backed corbyn .",
