                "elsewhere , after some weakness in february 's uk manufacturing figure and a up in the construction sector , the services index is expected to show a dip , from 54.5 in january to 54.2 as rising prices put a brake on consumer demand .", 
                "as for europe , michael hewson at cmc markets sums up expectations : in europe the latest spain , italy , france and germany services numbers [ are all ] expected to show significant improvements on their january numbers , with increases to 55.1 , 53.1 , 56.7 and 54.4 respectively .", 
                "in the us , there is expected to be a strong performance from the service sector , which is likely to add fuel to the growing belief that the federal reserve could raise interest rates as soon as this month 's meeting .", 
                "hewson again : the us remains the key driver of markets right now and the sudden hawkish stance of a number of previously dovish fed officials has caught investors somewhat off guard in the past week or so , and pushing the prospect that we 'll see another interest rate rise into a realistic prospect .", 
                "in fact such has been the turnaround in expectations , that a rate move looks more or less a done deal .", 
                "today 's us ism services numbers for february are expected to underscore this increased optimism with an expectation that we 'll see a robust 56.5 , however the acid test will be later today when a week of fed speakers concludes with four more fomc voting members speaking about the us economy .", 
                "that expectation has been pushing the dollar higher again , and as a consequence putting pressure on the pound .", 
                "as it happens , sterling is currently flat against the dollar at $ 1.2265 but has edged 0.15 % lower against the euro to \u20ac1.1653 .",
