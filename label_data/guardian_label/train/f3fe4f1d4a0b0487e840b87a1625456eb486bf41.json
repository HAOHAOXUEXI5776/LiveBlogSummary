                "here are the key points from the syria debate .", 
                "boris johnson , the foreign secretary , suggested that the house of commons itself was partly to blame for the plight of syria .", 
                "in his speech at the end of a two-hour emergency debate , in which the government came under sustained and emotional criticism , mostly from labour , for not doing more to help civilians in aleppo , johnson argued that the commons vote against military intervention against bashar al-assad in 2013 led to britain losing influence and russia getting the chance to become the dominant force in the syrian civil war .", 
                "he told mps : there is another inescapable reality that i 'm afraid members must accept , which is on august 29 2013 , this house voted by 13 votes not to use force against assad even after he had poisoned hundreds of his people with sarin nerve gas .", 
                "we as a house of commons , we as a country , we vacated that space into which russia stepped , beginning its own bombing campaign on behalf of assad .", 
                "ever since that vote , our ability to influence events in syria or to protect civilians or compel the delivery of aid has been severely limited .", 
                "the dictator was left to do his worst , along with his allies russia and iran , and the bloodiest tragedy of the 21st century has since unfolded .", 
                "cameron lost the vote on a proposal to bomb assad in 2013 by 285 votes to 272 after 30 conservatives and nine lib dems joined up with labour and smaller opposition parties to vote against the coalition .", 
                "johnson effectively ruled out using airdrops to deliver aid to civilians in aleppo , saying it was not safe because transport aircraft would be attacked .", 
                "he said that if circumstances changed he might reconsider , but he put the case against airdrops so strongly as to imply that a rethink was most unlikely .", 
                "he told mps : for air drops to be accurate they must be conducted at low level and low speed and russia has deployed its most advanced jet fighters and surface-to-air missiles in syria , which makes it impossible for us to carry out air drops without russian permission .", 
                "even if russia were to give its consent , our aircraft would still have to fly over areas of syria that are hotly contested by a multitude of armed groups , including daesh and al-qaida .", 
                "they would make every effort to shoot down a british plane and a lumbering , low-flying transport aircraft would be a sitting duck .", 
                "we came reluctantly to the conclusion that air drops over syria under those conditions would prove too great a risk .", 
                "and when it comes to drones and other devices , we still face the problem that it is the syrians and the russians who control the airspace .", 
                "of course it is possible that circumstances may change , so i will not rule out any option for delivering aid today but nor will i give false hope .", 
                "as things stand , we 'd be risking the lives of our aircrew if we were to try to drop supplies into eastern aleppo .", 
                "he urged the russians to stop supporting assad .", 
                "we are doing everything we can within the constraints that we face .", 
                "i hope that russia will see sense and join with us to secure the transition away from assad , that is the only hope for a peaceful syria .", 
                "it 's up to them .", 
                "it 's up to the russians , it 's up to iran .", 
                "they have the future of syria in their hands .", 
                "he strongly condemned the use of barrel bombs by the syrian armed forces .", 
                "giving a graphic description of how they worked , he told mps : imagine a metal drum , filled with petrol and explosives , laced with nails and jagged shards of metal .", 
                "these objects are loaded on board helicopters that then hover over civilian areas .", 
                "the men on the helicopters simply light the fuses on the barrels before rolling them out of the door , leaving them to fall on the ground where they shred and incinerate any human being within range .", 
                "there is no guidance system or targeting .", 
                "barrel bombs have no military purpose .", 
                "they can not be dropped near a frontline for fear of striking friendly forces .", 
                "their sole purpose is to murder civilians .", 
                "and scores of these dreadful weapons are being used against the people of eastern aleppo by assad every day .", 
                "george osborne used his first speech as a backbencher since being sacked as chancellor to say that western reluctance to intervene was to blame for what was happening in syria .", 
                "i think we are deceiving ourselves in this parliament if we believe that we have no responsibility for what has happened in syria .", 
                "the tragedy in aleppo did not come out of a vacuum , it was created by a vacuum , a vacuum of western leadership , of american leadership , british leadership .", 
                "osborne said that mps had learnt from what happened in iraq and afghanistan the price of intervention '' .", 
                "he went on : but i think we have come to a point where it 's impossible to intervene anywhere , that we lack the political will as the west to intervene .", 
                "but i have some hope out of this terrible tragedy in syria which is we are beginning to learn the price of not intervening .", 
                "we did not intervene in syria .", 
                "tens of thousands of people have been killed as a result .", 
                "millions of refugees have been sent from their homes across the world .", 
                "we have allowed a terrorist state to emerge in the form of isis which we are now trying to defeat .", 
                "key allies like lebanon and jordan are destabilised .", 
                "the refugee crisis has transformed the politics of europe , allowed fascism to rise in eastern europe , created extremist parties in western europe and russia , for the first time since henry kissinger kicked them out of the middle east in the 1970s , is back as the decisive player in that region .", 
                "that is the price of not intervening .", 
                "the labour mp john woodcock said he felt sick '' at the thought of ed miliband celebrating his role in defeating the government on the syria bombing vote in 2013 .", 
                "he said : i still feel sick at the idea of the then leader of the opposition going from that vote into the whips office , and congratulating himself and them on stopping a war , when look what is happening today and look what 's happened over the last three years .", 
                "the slaughter shames us all .", 
                "the labour mp ben bradshaw said it was highly probable '' that russia intervened in the eu referendum .", 
                "he was making a point about how the west had to take the threat from russia more seriously .", 
                "russia 's intervention in syria was partly motivated by a deliberate '' desire to drive refugees into europe to destabilise the west , he said .", 
                "he went on : and when will we admit that what putin ca n't achieve militarily , he is already achieving using cyber and propaganda warfare i do n't think we have even begun to wake up to what russia is doing when it comes to cyberwar , not only their interference , now proven , in the american presidential campaign , probably in our own referendum , we do n't have the evidence for that yet , but i think it 's highly probable .",
