                "nicola sturgeon 's main speech to the snp conference will come on saturday afternoon , but this morning 's address , although relatively short , was much more than just a self-congratulatory warm-up ( although it was that too ) .", 
                "it contained new material on the second referendum issue and a formula that sounded as if it were intended to shelve , from now until the scottish elections next year , any further controversy about what might or might not trigger a second independence poll .", 
                "here are the main points .", 
                "sturgeon played down the prospect of the snp trying to hold a second scottish independence referendum over the next five years .", 
                "she insisted it was important to respect '' the decision taken in september last year , and , for the first time , she said the snp would not try to hold another referendum unless there was strong and consistent evidence that people have changed their minds and that independence has become the choice of a clear majority in this country '' .", 
                "( see 10.57am . )", 
                "arguably you could say that she has contracted out snp referendum policy to yougov although , as she has said before , she did argue that a vote to take the uk out of the eu if the scots wanted to stay in would justify a second referendum .", 
                "some snp activists are very keen to hold a second referendum .", 
                "but sturgeon 's announcement reflects an awareness that many scottish voters , including those who voted yes last year , dread the thought of going through this argument all over again and are opposed to a second independence poll anytime soon .", 
                "for example , here an excerpt from a write-up of a focus group conducted in scotland during the general election .", 
                "one thing nobody said the [ snp ] should push for , and very few said they wanted , was an early second independence referendum .", 
                "we need to move on .", 
                "i think everyone 's acknowledged that '' ; i voted yes but i do n't think you can keep having referendums until you get the answer you want .", 
                "apart from anything else , if we voted for independence people would then start saying they wanted a referendum to join the union .", 
                "it should be a generational thing , not every few years . ''", 
                "the experience of quebec also explains why repeat independence referendums can be dangerous for independence parties .", 
                "of course , the scottish government does not actually have the legal power to call an independence referendum because that is a matter reserved to westminster .", 
                "but that does not constrain the snp much because if a majority snp government were to call for one , or to threaten to organise its own illegal '' one , westminster would come under considerable pressure to allow it .", 
                "sky news 's faisal islam points out that this will mean the snp manifesto will be the first for years not to promise a guaranteed referendum .", 
                "faisal islam ( @ faisalislam ) every single snp manifesto until now for scottish elections : 1999 , 2003 , 2007 , 2011 offered a guaranteed referendum and the financial times 's john mcdermott sums it all up quite neatly .", 
                "john mcdermott ( @ johnpmcdermott ) sturgeon , translated : we will have another independence referendum when opinion polls suggest that we will win one .", 
                "# snp15 sturgeon suggested she had given up hope of jeremy corbyn being able to provide effective opposition to the tories .", 
                "you know , there is much that i hoped the snp and jeremy corbyn could work together on .", 
                "but over these last few weeks , it has become glaringly obvious that he is unable to unite his party on any of the big issues of our day .", 
                "when he says he opposes trident , he is attacked , not just by the tories , but by his own shadow cabinet .", 
                "when he says he opposes the welfare cap , he is opposed , not just by iain duncan smith , but by his own shadow justice secretary .", 
                "a shadow justice secretary , incidentally , who is a member of the unelected house of lords .", 
                "labour is unreliable , unelectable and unable to stand up to the tories .", 
                "during the general election sturgeon talked repeatedly during the general election of how she hoped to form some kind of progressive alliance '' with labour at the time .", 
                "at the time labour figures doubted her sincerity ( because they believed her real priorities were independence and fighting labour in scotland ) , and today 's comments seem to confirm she is more interested in undermining labour than cooperating with it .", 
                "the snp believes that , if it can persuade the scots that labour has no hope of winning a westminster majority , they may be more inclined to back independence .", 
                "she said she hoped people who opposed independence could be persuaded to back the snp .", 
                "( but , as an unfortunate headline on a post earlier put it , this does not mean that she wants no voters to vote snp next year .", 
                "she wants no voters to vote snp next year , which is not the same thing . )", 
                "she said the snp would go into next year 's elections committed to building 50,000 affordable homes .",
