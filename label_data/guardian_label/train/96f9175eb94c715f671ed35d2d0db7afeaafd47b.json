                "the eu has retained the provisions in the draft treaty proposing regulatory alignment between northern ireland and ireland as a backstop solution to the border issue , even though theresa may described this wording as unacceptable .", 
                "both sides are committed to a solution , but today 's document shows that they are not closer to deciding what this could be .", 
                "the eu has retained a version of the proposed punishment clause that could be used to penalise the uk during the transition if it were seen to break single market rules .",
