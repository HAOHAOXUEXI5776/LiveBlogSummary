                "fitch concludes : overall , today 's announcement does not alter the view we expressed when we affirmed the uk 's 'aa ' sovereign rating in october , that the complexity of the issues , the magnitude of national interests at stake , the lack of a clear uk position , the eu 's negotiating stance , and the limited timeframe will make it challenging for the uk to secure a favourable trade agreement .",
