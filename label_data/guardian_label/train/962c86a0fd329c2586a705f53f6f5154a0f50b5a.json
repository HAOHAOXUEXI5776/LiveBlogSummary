                "politicians , even the good ones , are used to speaking in drab little meeting rooms or halls , with perhaps just a few dozen people in the audience .",

                "but every now and then , perhaps , they crave some showbiz celebrity - like playing the london palladium .", 
                "well , tonight , nick clegg , nigel farage , alan johnson and andrea leadsom are at the west end theatre - and they 've sold out .", 
                "the four will be discussing whether britain should remain in the european union or leave , at a debate chaired by the guardian 's new political editor anushka asthana .", 
                "it is one of many guardian live events organised through guardian members .", 
                "originally it was planned to stage it at a much smaller venue in westminster , but demand for tickets was enormous and so the venue was switched to the palladium , which seats just over 2,000 people .", 
                "do n't let anyone tell you there 's no interest in the eu referendum .", 
                "the panel features four of the most prominent politicians in the debate .", 
                "they are : for remain nick clegg - the former liberal democrat leader and deputy prime minister who has generally shunned the political limelight since his party crashed in the general election last year , but who feels passionate about eu membership , not least because he started his career in brussels as a eurocrat and then an mep .", 
                "alan johnson - the labour former home secretary who abandoned frontbench politics in 2011 only to spend the next five fending off speculation about how he would make a much better leader than the incumbent and who now , as chair of labour in for britain , is putting the case for the eu with an enthusiasm jeremy corbyn has yet to match .", 
                "for leave nigel farage - the charismatic yet divisive ukip leader who , like clegg , had a disappointing 2015 election ( he failed to get elected as an mp ) and who now finds he has the best chance of achieving the goal he has been striving for ever since he joined ukip in the early 1990s when it was tiny party on the political fringe .", 
                "andrea leadsom - the former banker first elected as a conservative mp in 2010 who made a name for herself as a pragmatic eurosceptic on the backbenches ( she ran the fresh start group ) before becoming first a treasury minister , then an energy minister , and who has recently been tipped as boris johnson 's first choice for chancellor were he to become pm .", 
                "the event starts at 7pm with performances from two comedians , andy zaltzman and sara pascoe .", 
                "the debate itself will not start until 8pm because the three mps on the panel have to vote on the investigatory powers bill in the commons .", 
                "anushka will be using questions from the audience , as well as questions submitted by guardian readers through witness and questions submitted through twitter .", 
                "the hashtag for the event is # guardianlive .", 
                "guardian readers are probably more likely to be at the pro-eu end of the plank , but i 'm told that a deliberate effort was made to ensure that tickets were sold to brexiters and so the audience should be fairly mixed .", 
                "this blog is going live now but i will not be updating it again until around 7.30 , not long before the debate starts .", 
                "then i will be covering the debate in detail and posting highlights at the end .", 
                "there is a live feed at the top of the blog which will start showing at 8pm .",
