                "the problem is , there have been a large number of online articles that have fact-checked donald trump on a whole range of issues , but they do n't seem to have slowed down the groundswell in support for the candidate .",

                "demonstrates the dangers of the shaky assumptions that have dominated this election assuming that trump would probably never make it past 20 % support , assuming that trump is one social phenomenon ( rather than a symptom of many ) and assuming that trump supporters are simply misguided in their choice for the next american president .",
