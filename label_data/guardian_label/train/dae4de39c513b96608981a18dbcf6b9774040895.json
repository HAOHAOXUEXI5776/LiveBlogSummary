                "under the deal , tsipras would have to campaign for a yes vote , which is hardly likely to happen .", 
                "reuters has some details of what would have been in it for the greeks : the offer published on sunday incorporated a proposal from greece that would set value-added tax rates on hotels at 13 percent , rather than at 23 percent as originally planned in the lenders ' proposals .", 
                "it was not immediately clear whether there would be any additional changes .", 
                "if the offer were accepted , the euro zone finance ministers could adopt a statement saying that a 2012 pledge to consider stretching out loan maturities , lowering interest rates and extending an interest payment moratorium on euro zone loans to greece would be implemented in october .", 
                "michael hewson , chief market analyst at cmc markets uk : in a sign that battle lines continue to be drawn eu leaders have turned sunday 's proposed referendum into an in/out vote on greece 's position in the euro , when it is clearly about the creditors proposal , but given that polls appear to suggest a majority of the greek population would prefer to stay in the euro , it suits the narrative of the eu to peddle that particular line .", 
                "in fact eu commission president juncker strayed a little too far into the realms of bad taste yesterday , urging the greek population not to commit suicide by voting no , which in a country that has seen suicides soar as a result of eu policies , was crassly insensitive , and could well turn out to be a massive own goal , if the vote is indecisive .", 
                "maybe that explains last night 's late move to make a fresh attempt at trying to reach a deal by the eu commission president , but in any event the deal was rebuffed by the greek pm , with the only concession appearing to be on vat for hotels being held down at 13 % , instead of raised to 23 % .",
