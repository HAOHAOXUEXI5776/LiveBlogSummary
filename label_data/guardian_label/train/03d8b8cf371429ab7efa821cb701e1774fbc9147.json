                "here are the main points from the tony blair hearing .", 
                "tony blair said his government 's decision to bring libya in from the cold '' may have prevented chemical weapons falling into the hands of islamic state ( isis ) .", 
                "the libyan leader muammar gaddafi agreed to abandon his chemical and nuclear weapons programme as part of the process that saw britain starting to repair relations with libya .", 
                "blair said this had important consequences today .", 
                "otherwise , we would have had a situation where libya was continuing to sponsor terrorism , was continuing to develop chemical and nuclear weapons and would have remained isolated in the international community .", 
                "i think it is important that we brought them in from the cold , as it were , and important also in today 's context because i think - particularly if we had still had the residue of that chemical weapons programme in libya today , given the state of libya today and given the presence of isis there - it would have constituted a real risk , even today .", 
                "he said libya 's chemical and nuclear weapons programme was more extensive than people thought .", 
                "he said the subsequent cooperation that britain had from libya in the fight against terrorism was invaluable '' .", 
                "he rejected suggestions that it would have been better to leave gaddafi in power .", 
                "you often find people saying look would n't it just be better if we dealt with the dictators ?", 
                "at least when we had assad there and saddam there and gaddafi there , and ben ali there we knew what we were dealing with .", 
                "i completely understand that argument , by the way .", 
                "but i think what the arab spring shows you is that however much we may want to have dealt with these people , the populations of these countries are not going to tolerate it .", 
                "in particular they are not going to tolerate a tiny group of people often unrepresentative of the majority in the country running the country .", 
                "i can tell you today obviously libya is a real security problem , it is a security problem for us actually here .", 
                "but i do n't think you can make the judgment as to whether it would be better if we had not intervened .", 
                "because you then have got to say how that would that then have played out as gaddafi tried to cling on to power and others tried to remove him .", 
                "you can look at syria today where we did n't intervene by the way and say that is even worse .", 
                "he said that when he spoke to gaddafi by phone before the 2011 western internvention he was not trying to save '' him .", 
                "he was just trying to see if a peaceful transition would be possible , he said .", 
                "he declined to criticise david cameron or nicolas sarkozy for taking military action against gaddafi in 2011 .", 
                "i know how difficult these decisions are .", 
                "i am sure they did it for reasons that are perfectly well intentioned and in good faith .", 
                "he rejected claims that he sidelined issues relating to lockerbie and yvonne fletcher when he began to establish relations with gaddafi .", 
                "he said he had never had personal business interests in libya .", 
                "that 's all from me for today .", 
                "thanks for the comments ."
