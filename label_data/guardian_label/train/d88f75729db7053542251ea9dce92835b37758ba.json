                "the eu has dismissed theresa may 's vision for a post-brexit trade relationship , laying out instead the offer of a deal that it concedes will be economically damaging to both the uk and the rest of europe .",

                "speaking at a news conference to mark the publication of a resolution on uk-eu trade , which meps are expected to vote for next week , he said : in order to break the deadlock we now face , i believe it is important that the uk government now seriously considers engaging with the european parliament 's proposal for an association agreement , as catered for by article 217 of the eu treaty .", 
                "i am convinced this will allow both the eu and the uk to unlock a lasting deep and special partnership for the future .", 
                "we look forward to receiving some further clarifications from the british government regarding citizen 's rights , as a number of outstanding issues remain unresolved .",

                "antonio tajani , president of the european parliament , said : as far as the european parliament is concerned , the principles governing our future relations are clear : single market integrity must be preserved , a third country can not be treated more favourably than an eu member state and a level playing field is essential .",

                "but , anyway , it will only be a trade agreement .",

                "for example , the eu can not agree to grant the uk the rights of norway with the obligations of canada .",
