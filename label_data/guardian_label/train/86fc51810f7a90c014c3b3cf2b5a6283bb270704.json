                "for many of my political opponents , it seems that \u0080\u0098free speech ' has a very selective meaning indeed .", 
                "though they would never dare admit it , \u0080\u0098free speech ' for some means that reactionary shock-jocks are free to indulge in rants that ride roughshod over the standards of truth and basic decency that our community expects and deserves .", 
                "for some , it means that no racist hate speech is too vile to be constrained by the law .",

                "first , what i will call the \u0080\u0098absolutist ' position on free speech ignores the fact that government restraint is not the only threat to freedom of speech .", 
                "as the race discrimination commissioner noted in his excellent alice tay lecture in human rights and law at the anu in march this year , freedom is not merely the absence of external restraint .",

                "courts , for example , lay down strict rules and procedures about how parties are to argue their case to ensure that proceedings are fair .", 
                "the free press , which fulfils a critical role in our democracy , must be careful in its reporting or risk breaching our defamation laws .", 
                "even more importantly , the journalists who work in our media are bound by a rigorous set of professional ethics , though the extent to which they adhere to these ethics , and what can be done if they do not , are complex issues worthy of a speech in themselves .", 
                "parliaments , ostensibly the ultimate forum for free political debate in our society , impose very prescriptive standing orders .", 
                "while the laws of privilege free me from the constraints of defamation law inside the parliament , i am constrained in other ways from what i can say .",

                "the standing orders try to ensure that parliamentary debate is conducted in an orderly , dignified and appropriate manner , though watching question time you might have your own opinion on how successful this framework is .", 
                "in almost any forum where our society debates important issues we impose rules governing speech .", 
                "my second criticism of the absolutist position on free speech is that it ignores the relationship between free speech and other human rights .",

                "the human rights system both domestically and internationally is intended to clearly direct our attention to this important and delicate task .", 
                "the statute establishing the australian human rights commission expressly says that it is the duty of the commission to perform its work with regard to the indivisibility of the whole body of human rights .", 
                "that free speech is limited by reference to other human rights is apparent on the face of the international agreements we have agreed to .", 
                "article 19 of the international covenant on civil and political rights ( \u0080\u0098iccpr ' ) states that everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression .",

                "the right to freedom of expression may be curtailed in order to protect the rights of others .", 
                "it was the mistaken belief that an absolute freedom of speech trumps other important rights which drove the abbott government 's misguided attempt to repeal s 18c of the racial discrimination act .", 
                "of course , this divisive attack on our protections against hate speech was finally dropped on tuesday by the prime minister , who termed it an unnecessary \u0080\u0098complication ' for the government .", 
                "the prime minister seems to have developed a newfound talent for understatement .", 
                "i understand that the prime minister was trying to ease the embarrassment to senator brandis , who has so clearly lost the confidence of his cabinet colleagues , not to say the liberal backbench and a very large part of the australian community .", 
                "however , the government 's attack on section 18c was much more than a \u0080\u0098complication ' .", 
                "that the prime minister described his abandonment of senator brandis 's signature policy in terms of a simple political calculation tells you a lot about this government 's continued commitment to a distorted view of what freedom of speech means .", 
                "most notably , what mr abbott failed to do this week was to admit to the australian people that he and his attorney-general had got it wrong on section 18c .", 
                "and so the victory we had this week in the government 's back-down was marred by the knowledge that the eloquent arguments expressed in the thousands of submissions opposing the gutting of our race hate protections did not convince the government to abandon its reckless course .", 
                "what convinced the government to back down was that the political costs of continuing on its hugely unpopular and ideologically blinkered course were simply too great .", 
                "so while we have had a victory and i congratulate again all those who fought the government on this issue the truth is that government 's ideological blinkers are still firmly in place .", 
                "they still do n't get it .", 
                "they still have an undergraduate understanding of political philosophy and of human rights .", 
                "the abbott government still does n't understand , as any human rights lawyer could explain , that the human right to free speech has always been subject to the human right to be free from racial discrimination .", 
                "senator brandis 's defining policy priority as attorney-general has failed because he did not care to understand the breadth and nuance required of an authentic human rights agenda .", 
                "senator brandis , a sworn devotee of the \u0080\u0098marketplace of ideas ' his government appears determined to shut down , should recognise when he has lost an argument .", 
                "his colleagues certainly have .", 
                "i will not say any more about the racial discrimination act now .", 
                "my topic today is free speech .", 
                "the particular focus on s 18c by senator brandis , and the spirited defence that this attack engendered , has distracted from a number of other threats posed to free speech in our society .", 
                "i am sad to say that many of those threats emanate from the current government : a government whose heated rhetoric on free speech is belied by its actions .", 
                "i will return for a moment to orwell 's reflection on politics and language .", 
                "when abbott government ministers talks about \u0080\u0098free speech ' , they are n't just ignorant , but disingenuous .", 
                "i do n't for a second believe that those who trumpet their commitment to unfettered free speech in the debate surrounding the racial discrimination act in actuality support an absolute approach to freedom of speech .", 
                "if they hewed closely to their professed principles , the libertarians amongst the abbott government would be demanding a radical revision or even abolition of defamation law and the abolition of offensive language offences .",

                "no , though the liberal government and its supporters talk in sweeping terms about \u0080\u0098free speech ' , they have in mind a much more selective application of that right .", 
                "the attorney-general likes to invoke voltaire 's ( perhaps apocryphal ) declaration that he would defend to the death the right to say things with which he completely disagrees .", 
                "this is heady stuff in the australian political arena , which is usually more given to pragmatism than philosophy .", 
                "i am sad to say that i can see no evidence of the sort of political bravery that would have impressed the great french thinker .",

                "though this government says it has a \u0080\u0098profound ' commitment to free speech , it has deliberately sidelined expert ngos from policy discussion .", 
                "senator brandis has changed the terms on which the commonwealth funds community legal centres ( \u0080\u0098clcs ' ) right around the country to prevent them from speaking out on ways in which the law might be usefully reformed , or even from responding to government inquiries and consultations .",

                "chillingly , the government has also removed clause 5 of the agreements , inserted by the last labor government .", 
                "that clause affirmed the commitment of our government that conditions attached to commonwealth funding to clcs would not \u0080\u0098stifle legitimate debate or prevent organisations engaging in advocacy activities . '",

                "in senate estimates , senator brandis admitted that there had been no analysis of edo funding arrangements done before the government terminated all funding .", 
                "indeed , senator brandis 's decision flies in the face of the advice being provided to his government , if he would care to listen .",

                "we might conclude that the government cut funding to these community organisations simply because they do n't like what those organisations sometimes say and what they sometimes advocate for , regardless of the benefits they consistently provide to our community and our environment .",
