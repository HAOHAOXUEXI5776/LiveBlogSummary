                "a leading member of the us federal reserve has warned of the dangers of continuing low interest rates .", 
                "vice chairman stanley fischer said in a speech in new york there were three reasons to be concerned about low rates : first , and most worrying , is the possibility that low long-term interest rates are a signal that the economy 's long-run growth prospects are dim a second concern is that low interest rates make the economy more vulnerable to adverse shocks that can put it in a recession and the third concern is that low interest rates may also threaten financial stability as some investors reach for yield and compressed net interest margins make it harder for some financial institutions to build up capital buffers those are three powerful reasons to prefer interest rates that are higher than current rates .", 
                "but , of course , fed interest rates are kept very low at the moment because of the need to maintain aggregate demand at levels that will support the attainment of our dual policy goals of maximum sustainable employment and price stability , defined as the rate of inflation in the price level of personal consumption expenditures being at our target level of 2 percent .", 
                "he said there were a variety of factors holding down interest rates - including slow economic growth , low investment , a slowdown in the global economy - and they may continue to go so for some time .", 
                "but he added economic policy could help offset these factors , and boost the economy 's growth potential : while there is disagreement about what the most effective policies would be , some combination of more encouragement for private investment , improved public infrastructure , better education , and more effective regulation is likely to promote faster growth of productivity and living standards-and also to reduce the probability that the economy and , particularly , the central bank will in the future have to contend with the effective lower bound ."
