                "cripin blunt , the conservative chair of the commons foreign affairs committee , spoke after angus robertson in the debate and he said he would not be voting for trident renewal .", 
                "earlier , in an intervention , he said that his current estimate was that trident renewal would have a lifetime cost of \u00e2\u00a3 179bn .", 
                "earlier jeremy corbyn quoted blunt as saying the cost would be \u00e2\u00a3 167bn .", 
                "( see 4.55pm . )", 
                "but blunt said he had updated his figures .", 
                "the ministry of defence said the new submarines would cost \u00e2\u00a3 31bn , and that there would be a \u00e2\u00a3 10bn contingency .", 
                "on top of that the running costs , which the mod says will be 6 % of its budget over 32 years , will take the total cost to \u00e2\u00a3 179bn , he said .", 
                "mps are limited to five-minute speeches , but blunt said he had set out his views at length in a new post on his blog .", 
                "here is a summary of the arguments he made there .", 
                "blunt said trident renewal would be the most egregious act of self-harm to our conventional defence .", 
                "i oppose the renewal of trident because i care about the security of my country .", 
                "i 'm not prepared to be party to the most egregious act of self-harm to our conventional defence .", 
                "this is a colossal investment in a weapons system that will become increasingly vulnerable and for whose security we will have to throw good money , after bad in fact tens of billions of it more than already estimated to try to keep it safe in the decades to come .", 
                "he said it was a threat to the future of the uk .", 
                "then let us not forget the risks that this particular weapon system presents to the united kingdom .", 
                "basing it in scotland strengthens the nationalist narrative .", 
                "ironically for a system justified on the basis that it protects the uk , it could prove instrumental in the union 's undoing .", 
                "he said that tory mps did not care about the cost of trident and that this was irrational .", 
                "the costs of this project are enormous .", 
                "i 've asked a number of colleagues privately at what point do these costs become prohibitive ?", 
                "i ca n't get an answer , short of those who say whatever it takes .", 
                "surely an answer of infinity is completely irrational .", 
                "it 's not only damaging to our economic security , with a fixed share of our nation 's wealth being spent on defence , this comes at deeply injurious opportunity cost to our conventional defence .", 
                "at what point do either of these prices cease to be worth paying ?", 
                "he said future technology could render nuclear submarines obsolete .", 
                "there is a growing body of evidence that emerging technologies will render the seas increasingly transparent in the foreseeable future .", 
                "under development are distributed sensors detecting acoustic , magnetic , neutrino and electro-magnetic signatures , on board unmanned vehicles in communication with each other , using swarming algorithms and autonomous operations associated with artificial intelligence , able to patrol indefinitely and using the extraordinary processing capabilities now available and improving by the month .", 
                "the geometric improvement in processing power means your smart phone is far superior to that of the latest us fighter aircraft .", 
                "furthermore , unmanned aircraft will detect the surface wake of deeply submerged submarines communicating with those underwater receiving active sonar .", 
                "marine biologists are already able to track shoals of fish in real time from several hundred miles away .", 
                "ballistic missile submarines depend utterly upon their stealth by utilising the sheer size of the oceans .", 
                "if we are today able to detect the gravitational waves first created by the big bang , how can we be so confident that a capable adversary would not be able to track our submarines 20 years from now ?", 
                "he said trident could be vulnerable to cyber attack .", 
                "what about the security of the trident system from cyber attack ?", 
                "we will be spending several tens of billions on our nuclear weapon system in order to threaten our adversaries with nuclear attack .", 
                "there is every incentive for them to invest in offensive cyber capabilities at a fraction of this price in order to neutralise them .", 
                "the systems are vulnerable through the components that are supplied to bae systems , through the period of assembly , when the submarines are in refit , or when they are being restocked between patrols .", 
                "the air-gap with the internet provides only minimal protection , as the stuxnet attack on the iranian centrifuges demonstrated .", 
                "he said the government should consider cheaper nuclear alternatives .", 
                "we should be considering alternatives , such as deploying these modernised free-fall bombs on the new f35 jets we are buying from the americans .",

                "there is no reason why the prime minister has to open this debate - it would have been perfectly acceptable to leave it up to the defence secretary - and arguably there is no reason why the debate is needed anyway , because the commons has already voted in principle to renew the trident nuclear deterrent .",

                "but a majority of mps are expected to vote in favour , in line with current party policy ( or party policy as most recently agreed - corbyn 's allies argue that , because policy on trident is being reviewed , there currently is no party policy ) , and emily thornberry , the shadow foreign secretary , and clive lewis , the shadow defence secretary are abstaining .",
