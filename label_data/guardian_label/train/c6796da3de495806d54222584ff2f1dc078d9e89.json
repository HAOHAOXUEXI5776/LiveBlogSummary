                "the government says we do n't have a revenue problem , we have a spending problem , so moody 's observations were n't all that helpful .", 
                "post budget , the agency has issued a new assessment about the path back to surplus .", 
                "it is n't sounding convinced about the government 's direction .", 
                "here 's the statement : moody 's investors service says that the australian government will face challenges in achieving the objective of fiscal consolidation outlined in its fy2017 budget in view of an environment of subdued nominal gdp growth and given sizeable spending obligations .", 
                "moody 's notes that successive revisions by governments towards more persistent deficits in recent years highlight the difficulties in curbing spending and , overall , expects the government 's debt burden to rise somewhat higher .", 
                "a slower pace of fiscal consolidation will leave public finances vulnerable to negative shocks , particularly to a potential marked downturn in the housing sector and a reversal in current favourable external financing conditions .", 
                "moody 's sees a mixed economic environment for the fy2017 budget and , while forecasting robust real gdp growth at around 2.5 % during fy2017 , also expects lacklustre nominal growth , weighed down by muted corporate profitability and wage growth , which will adversely affect budget outcomes .", 
                "this expected modest nominal level of gdp growth will challenge the government 's revenue projections .", 
                "revenues have undershot previous projections , partly because of the fall in commodities prices and its impact on profits and wages .", 
                "with the adjustment to these lower prices still under way , profit tax and income tax revenues are likely to grow only modestly in the next few years .", 
                "the rise in the tobacco excise , the restriction on tax advantages on superannuation contributions and the clampdown on tax avoidance will be as highlighted in the budget the main sources of increases in revenue .", 
                "but the combined total for the expected additional revenues over the next four years will be offset by various tax rebates as part of the ten year enterprise tax plan and other changes to superannuation taxation .", 
                "limits to the effectiveness of spending restraint are further evident .", 
                "with education , health , social security and welfare accounting for around 60 % of total spending , achieving significant expenditure restraint will be challenging and commitments in these areas risk largely offsetting efficiency savings .", 
                "at the same time , the unfavourable upward trend in australia 's debt is mitigated by a high level of debt affordability , with interest payments amounting to around 4 % of revenues , although this marks a higher level compared with 10 years ago .", 
                "in an environment of low interest rates in domestic markets and given favourable external financing conditions , affordability will likely remain high , although vulnerable to a change in financing conditions ."
