                "the house of representatives adjourned after having overwhelmingly passed an nsa-reform bill , the usa freedom act , putting the onus on the senate to either pass a bill that would curtail some nsa powers or to allow section 215 of the patriot act to expire at the end of the month .",

                "earnest said that obama administration officials had put pressure on senators to vote for the bill .", 
                "some senators proposed a two-week extension in lieu of a two-month one , and others suggested that nsa powers should be allowed to lapse briefly and then immediately taken up again once congress returns in early june .", 
                "if both bills fail and senators can find now compromise , section 215 will expire and end the nsa 's bulk collection of phone data and some of the fbi 's surveillance powers .",
