                "greece 's finance minister euclid tsakalotos will hold urgent talks in brussels today turning to greece , finance minister euclid tsakalotos has urgently flown to brussels in an attempt to end the deadlock in stalled talks between the country and its eu-led creditors .", 
                "our correspondent helena smith reports from athens : in a last ditch effort to break the deadlock that has once again ignited fears of a new greek crisis - and default by the summer - finance minister euclid tsakalotos has rushed to brussels for a meeting with the heads of the creditor institutions .", 
                "speculation is rife that the oxford-educated tsakalotos is prepared to make what the greek media this morning are describing as the big compromise '' in order to clinch a technical '' agreement with lenders before euro area finance minister hold their monthly eurogroup session on 20 february .", 
                "if sealed , auditors would return to athens next week in the hopes of finally concluding the compliance review at the heart of the impasse .", 
                "tsakalotos is expected to be presented with an alternative set of measures that athens ' leftist-led government could put its signature to in time for a deal to be reached before europe goes into election mode , starting with polls in the netherlands next month .", 
                "the proposal , to be presented to the minister this afternoon , is believed to be more palatable in that the government would not have to legislate contingency measures ( not least tax increases and pension cuts ) before the country 's current bailout expires in the summer of 2018 .", 
                "the cuts are thought to amount to 2 percent of greek gross domestic product and would only be implemented if athens fails to meet the budget targets agreed under its latest bailout .", 
                "if true , the face-saving formula may avert the spectre of bankruptcy this summer when greek faces a \u20ac7bn debt repayment in july , but is unlikely to resolve the lingering problem of greece 's mountainous debt or go down well with many in the ruling syriza party who have become increasingly restive at the prospect of inflicting yet more measures on austerity-whipped greeks ."
