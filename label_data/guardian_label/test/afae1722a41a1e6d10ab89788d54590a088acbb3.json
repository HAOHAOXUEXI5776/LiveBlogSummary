                "why ?", 
                "because of theresa may 's oft-stated , though widely-disputed , view that the nhs is already getting more money than it asked for between now and 2020 .", 
                "and her belief - first disclosed by the guardian last october - that the nhs can learn useful lessons from her time as home secretary in cutting police budgets and seeing crime falling at the same time .",

                "that 's the pot of nhs funding that 's been raided by the health secretary jeremy hunt to the tune of \u00a3 1.2bn this year , to help keep struggling hospitals going , amid the huge pressures they are under .", 
                "another \u00a3 1bn is expected to disappear again from that pot in the new financial year starting next month , just when stevens 's bold plans to transform '' how the nhs works through stps means nhs organisations need more money for capital than before , not less - to build , for example , new community health centres and the like as care is shifted out of hospitals .", 
                "on that , though , stevens conceded defeat .",
