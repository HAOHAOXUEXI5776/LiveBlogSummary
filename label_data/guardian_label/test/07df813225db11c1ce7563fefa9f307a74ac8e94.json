                "the latest consumer price index data is released at 10am gmt , and economists believe it will show that harmonised inflation across the euro area fell by 0.1 % over the last year .", 
                "prices have been dragged down by falling oil and cost-cutting from europe 's struggling firms .",

                "core inflation ( stripping out volatile items like energy and fuel ) is expected to remain at 0.7 % .", 
                "we also get the latest eurozone unemployment data at 10am gmt , and it 's likely to confirm that europe 's labour markets remain tough .", 
                "italy 's unemployment rate could hit a new record high of 13.3 % , keeping the eurozone-wide rate at 11.5 % .",
