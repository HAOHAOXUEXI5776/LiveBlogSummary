                "george osborne , the chancellor , has said that the election of corbyn will set labour back a generation .", 
                "in an interview with the new statesman , he said : i ca n't help noticing that , for most of my childhood and early adult life , a succession of labour party leaders reformed the constitution of the labour party .", 
                "neil kinnock did , john smith did , tony blair did , to make sure that it was more rooted in what the british people wanted .", 
                "and it does seem , as an external observer , that a generation 's work has been unravelled in the space of 12 months .", 
                "he said the election of liz kendall would have caused the tories the greatest problems '' .", 
                "but he said the election of corbyn would be bad for the country .", 
                "the whole of the labour party moves leftwards , abandoning the centre and , i think , therefore abandoning the working people of this country i do n't think that 's particularly good for the country that you have an opposition heading off to the wilderness there 's no doubt ideas like abandoning britain 's nuclear deterrent at a time when , frankly , more and more countries are trying to acquire nuclear weapons , or some of the things that have been said about terrorist organisations like hamas , are deeply unpalatable .", 
                "i do n't think they represent the views of the british people .", 
                "but we do n't regard what is being said in the labour leadership contest as a joke .", 
                "we take it deadly seriously .", 
                "i regard these things as a real risk to britain 's security were they ever to have the chance to be put into practice .", 
                "in a wide-ranging interview , he also said that he was not thinking at the moment about the possibility of leading the conservative party .", 
                "i 'm just mentally able to say , 'i 'm not addressing that now .", 
                "i 'm not thinking about that now . '", 
                "and he said the problem for the liberal democrats was that they were all things to all people '' in the end , the liberal democrats ' all things to all people '' approach caught up with them and then they were no things to no people .", 
                "that potpourri of centre-right liberals , iraq war rebels , celtic fringe methodists [ and ] local populists turned out not to be very coherent .", 
                "andy burnham has made a last-minute appeal to people to vote in the labour leadership contest .", 
                "voting closes tomorrow at midday and , in a message , he said : our latest data shows that it 's neck and neck between jeremy corbyn and me .", 
                "your vote could be crucial . ''", 
                "his team claim that , of the 5,750 people they contacted yesterday who had not yet voted , 61 % said they favoured burnham and 31 % yvette cooper .", 
                "corbyn has also issued a statement ahead of a final rally he is holding in islington tomorrow .", 
                "he said : labour lost the election because they had no clear alternative to the tories ' unnecessary , self-serving austerity plans .", 
                "i 've outlined policies which would provide decent jobs , homes , and schools , nurture high-tech , socially productive industries and foster a fairer , more inclusive britain .", 
                "in packed rallies from aberdeen to essex , these ideas have received an amazing welcome , showing that people are thirsting for a proper alternative to the current savage cuts .", 
                "in a separate development , the bbc is reporting that one of corbyn 's most senior supporters urged him to withdraw from the contest a few weeks ago because the supporter thought winning was never his intention .", 
                "philip hammond , the foreign secretary , has told mps that bombing islamic state ( isis ) in iraq but not in syria is incoherent '' .", 
                "in evidence to the commons foreign affairs committee he also said military logic '' supported extending air strikes .", 
                "we would see authority to attack isil [ isis ] targets more widely in syria as being a part of the campaign against isil , which at the moment is confined to iraq .", 
                "we would see it as driven by a military logic which says you look at the enemy holistically , you look at his supply lines , you look at his support bases , you look at his command and control nodes and those are the things you want to attack .", 
                "the logic of extending our mandate to cover isil targets in syria would be very clearly a logic in support of the mandate we have in iraq for the collective defence of that country . ''", 
                "in the east of syria , in the isil strongholds in raqqah , the ability to attack from the air would in our judgement enhance the utility of the military mission .", 
                "in the end the objective is to defeat isil and that means we have to get to the controlling brain .", 
                "that 's all from me for today .", 
                "thanks for the comments ."
