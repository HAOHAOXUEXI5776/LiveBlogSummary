                "david cameron has said that a single piece of intelligence from saudi arabia may have saved hundreds of british lives .", 
                "he made the revelation as he sought to justify the government 's decision to fly the union flag at half-mast to mark the recent death of the king abdullah of saudi arabia .", 
                "( see 4.31pm . )", 
                "gordon brown , the labour former prime minister , and jim murphy , the scottish labour leader , have unveiled what they call the vow plus '' - proposals to give scotland more powers on top of those in the smith commission report that implement the vow '' made by wesminster leaders before the independence referendum .", 
                "although brown used to be opposed to devolving welfare spending ( see the speech he gave on march last year ) , today he said scotland should have the power to top up welfare benefits .", 
                "the vow plus is an insurance policy against the conservative government today and any attempt in the future to impose benefit decisions that do n't accord with scottish needs and conditions .", 
                "the vow plus is a guarantee that in the final analysis the last word on benefit changes can rest with the scottish people .", 
                "and implementing the vow plus is in my view a better way of delivering the social justice agenda of the scottish parliament than breaking away from our uk pensions - worth \u00a3 500 million extra to scotland - and our uk-wide system of help for the unemployed and families for which the risks are shared across the uk and from which we also benefit .", 
                "scottish child benefits , unemployment benefits and pensioner benefits would start from the social and economic rights guaranteed by the uk welfare state , and we would start from uk benefit decisions about rates and eligibility .", 
                "that would be the base line , but if the scottish parliament wished to do so and was prepared to pay for it the parliament would be able to top up rates it found did not accord with scottish needs or scottish conditions .", 
                "the snp said that labour had been panicked by the snp 's success , because until recently labour was opposed to going beyond the devolution plans in the smith commission report .", 
                "stewart hosie , the snp deputy leader , said '' today 's announcement from jim murphy and gordon brown shows that their disastrous poll ratings are causing panic in labour 's ranks .", 
                "labour are under severe pressure from the people of scotland , who are backing the snp in increased numbers .", 
                "and if this is what labour do when faced with disastrous opinion polls , scotland will be able to achieve so much more by electing a strong team of snp mps to hold the balance of power at westminster .", 
                "last month , labour tried to tell people that the vow had been delivered and there should be no more discussion of further powers for scotland.today , as more and more people back the snp ahead of the coming election , labour have been dragged along in scotland 's wake .", 
                "and nicola sturgeon , scotland 's first minister , said : nicola sturgeon ( @ nicolasturgeon ) if our poll lead has labour desperately trying to make the vow sound better , think how much real power a big snp team can win for scotland david laws , the lib dem schools minister , has dismissed cameron 's school spending announcement ( see 2.26pm ) as unbelievably weak '' .", 
                "he said : this is an unbelievably weak commitment from david cameron and the conservatives .", 
                "the conservatives have failed even to protect the schools budget in real terms and it is clear that they will have to make deep cuts to early years and 16-19 education .", 
                "there has been radio silence over the \u00a3 2.5bn pupil premium , which is getting extra money to the children who need it most , and already starting to transform the life chances of poorer pupils .", 
                "this makes a mockery of the conservatives ' claims to want to raise standards .", 
                "you simply ca n't improve education while starving schools , nurseries and colleges of the resources they need .", 
                "northern ireland 's health minister , jim wells , has backed plans to introduce standardised cigarette packaging .", 
                "he said the region would be included in the uk government 's proposals for plain tobacco product packets , which is set to be voted on by mps in westminster before the general election .", 
                "that 's all from me for today .",
