                "he has , of course , had a remarkable election victory , but that does not seem to be because he has changed minds ; as he has suggested himself in interviews , it is more because he became the outlet for voters totally fed up with the labour establishment who found at last a candidate who represented their views .", 
                "he has shown little interest in what a labour leader might have to say to win over voters who do n't already agree with him .", 
                "indeed , his victory speech this morning was notable because contained almost nothing aimed at appealing to the classic , middle england floating voter .",

                "asked how he could win an election with his policies , corbyn has highlighted the large number of votes labour could win by mobilising a leftish coalition of people who either did not register or turn out in 2015 , or who voted for other progressive parties because they found labour uninspiring .", 
                "it is true that there are plenty of votes in this pool .", 
                "but a fabian analysis looked at this strategy in some detail and concluded that the prospects of it providing a route to electoral victory were bleak .", 
                "6 - party image matters too - and it remains to be seen whether labour will enjoy a corbyn bounce .", 
                "the tories under michael howard and labour under ed miliband have both been in the situation where they have had individual policies that are popular , but where they have found it hard to capitalise on those because the party 's image overall is negative .", 
                "will having corbyn as leader make people feel more positive about labour generally ?", 
                "it is far too soon to know , but as yet there is no evidence that it will .", 
                "there have been at least two state of the party polls conducted since corbyn took the lead in the leadership race , and they have both shown it languishing well behind the tories ( on 31 points and 28 points respectively ) .", 
                "7 - on a personal level , voters may warm to corbyn .", 
                "the public probably has not yet formed a settled view on jeremy corbyn , but there are some aspects of his character people are likely to find very appearing .", 
                "he is the antithesis of a career politician ( in fact , it would be hard to find a politician less careerist ) , he does n't speak in politico-cliche about hard-working families and he is self-effacing , modest and frugal .", 
                "8 - but leaders have to be good at leading - and corbyn 's leadership skills are almost entirely untested .", 
                "he could turn out to be hopeless , or he could turn out to be surprisingly good .", 
                "his executive experience may be limited to chairing haringey council 's public works committee in the 1970s , but that is more executive experience than tony blair had when he became labour leader and there are different models of effective leadership .", 
                "corbyn has said he wants to run a consensual administration ( ie , more attlee than churchill ) , and perhaps he will do this effectively .", 
                "but , equally , many of his colleagues think he will prove temperamentally unsuited to leadership ( for reasons andy mcsmith set out here , in the independent . )", 
                "9 - and it is hard ( though not , of course , inconceivable ) to see corbyn as prime minister .", 
                "ultimately elections are about choosing a prime ministers , and even many corbyn admirers find it hard to see him walking through the door of downing street .", 
                "that may explain why the notion that he will only be a caretaker leader is so widespread .", 
                "( in his excellent account of the corbyn campaign today , my colleague ewen macaskill says that , if corbyn was ever minded to think this way , he has changed during the campaign , and is now in for the long haul . )", 
                "10 - everything could change , particularly if some crisis erupts , making all conventional assumptions redundant .", 
                "the most obvious example would be some sort of economic catastrophe , that could lead to corbyn-led labour defying the pundits and taking power in the manner of syriza in greece .", 
                "it does not seem probable but , equally , it is by no means unthinkable .", 
                "so , overall , is corbyn really unelectable ?", 
                "quite possibly , but no one can plausibly say yes or no to this question with 100 % certainty , and ultimately this one is going to have to be resolved by the electorate .", 
                "( to be fair , it is also worth pointing out that there are also strong grounds for thinking that corbyn 's three labour leadership rivals would also have had considerable difficulties winning the next general election . )"
