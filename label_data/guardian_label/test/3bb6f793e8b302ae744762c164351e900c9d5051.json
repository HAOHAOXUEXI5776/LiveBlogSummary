                "analysts at s & p have raised their 2018 price target for brent crude to $ 55 a barrel but kept their wti target at $ 50 , saying , we anticipate that global oil supply is likely to broadly match consumption in the first half of 2018 , assuming the opec cuts are maintained . ''", 
                "s & p added : we recognize the ty volatility of these market indicators , as demonstrated during 2017 .", 
                "we also note the persistence of a wider differential of $ 6 per barrel ( /bbl ) between brent and wti recently , although we believe this differential is likely to be nominally smaller in 2018 .", 
                "we base our long-term price assumptions mostly on fundamental analysis including assessments of the marginal cost of oil and gas production , as well as supply and demand fundamentals , for example we continue to expect brent and wti to be range-bound in 2018 .", 
                "we note that brent has been trading above $ 60/bbl since oct. 27 , 2017 , having closed at that price on sept. 25 for the first time since july 2015 .", 
                "as present , futures prices remain above $ 60/bbl until november 2018 .",
