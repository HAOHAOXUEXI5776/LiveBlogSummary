                "here are the the main points from david cameron 's appearance on sky .", 
                "david cameron has insisted that his hopes of getting net migration below 100,000 remain credible in his first major tv appearance during the eu referendum campaign .", 
                "for an hour he faced tough questions from members of the audience and sky 's faisal islam , in an encounter that saw many of the members of the public asking questions show considerable scepticism regarding his eu claims , and his record generally .", 
                "on immigration , he defended his decision to set a target of getting annual net migration below 100,000 - a target the government is missing by more than 200,000 .", 
                "at the time he first proposed it , it was realistic , he claimed .", 
                "he also suggested that in future economic growth in europe would lead to the numbers coming down .", 
                "when i made that ambition for britain , at that time net migration between people leaving and people coming from europe was broadly in balance .", 
                "it was about trying to reduce migration from outside .", 
                "but we have been living in extraordinary times when the british economy was growing strongly and we 've created 2m jobs .", 
                "there was a time when we were creating more jobs that other european countries put together .", 
                "that wo n't continue for ever .", 
                "he also said the target remains the right ambition for britain .", 
                "but trying to cut immigration by leaving the eu and pulling out of the single market would be madness he said , because of the economic damage it would cause .", 
                "cameron rejected claims that he was scaremongering about the economic impact of brexit .", 
                "james dexter , a businessman , asked the prime minister what personal damage the scaremongering has done to your legacy .", 
                "cameron replied : i do n't accept it is scaremongering .", 
                "i am genuinely worried about britain leaving the single market .", 
                "at another point , he said that he would be failing in his job if he did not respond to the economic warnings about leaving the eu .", 
                "frankly , i think the job of the prime minister is to warn about potential dangers as well as to talk about the upsides and the opportunities there are by being a member of this organisation .", 
                "but if i did n't listen to the imf , to the oecd , to the tuc , to the cbi , to the governor of the bank of england - if i did n't listen to any of these people , i would not be doing my job and i would not be serving this country .", 
                "he urged people to think about their children when deciding how to vote .", 
                "this is what he said in his short statement at the end .", 
                "i would just say to everybody : as we go home and wake up in the morning and look our children and our grandchildren in the eye and we think who we are responsible for through our pay packet , let us not roll the dice on their future .", 
                "britain does n't succeed when we quit , we succeed when we get stuck in and we work to improve these organisations and we safeguard the prosperity and the security of this great country .", 
                "to me , that 's what it 's all about .", 
                "he had an angry exchange with a student who accused him of waffling .", 
                "( see 10.11pm . )", 
                "he defended the treasury 's decision to say that households could lose \u00e2\u00a3 4,300 if the uk leaves the eu .", 
                "the commons treasury committee described this as misleading , because the figure refers to lost national income , not lost disposable household income .", 
                "but cameron did not accept he should withdraw the figure .", 
                "that figure is the loss to the economy divided by the number of households in our country .", 
                "if our country is poorer , then our households are going to be poorer .", 
                "what this means is fewer jobs , it means lower wages , it means less income .", 
                "those are the things that we would be inflicting on ourselves if we voted to leave .", 
                "he defended the fact that eu membership means the european court of justice can adjudicate on tax policy and other matters .", 
                "he said : i accept we have a single market and you have to have a single set of rules for those countries .", 
                "would we be more sovereign if we left ?", 
                "would we have more control ?", 
                "the only difference is you are not round the table making the rules .", 
                "he rejected the claim that britain loses more arguments in the eu 's council of ministers than any other nations .", 
                "it only looks like that because britain insists on putting matters to a vote when it is going to lose , so it can get its disagreement on the record , he said .", 
                "he said other countries that are being outvoted do not do this .", 
                "he said that if britain were not a member of the eu , he would recommend joining - but only on the special terms he has negotiated .", 
                "if i was offered the terms that britain has , i would accept them , because our membership is very different from anybody else 's .", 
                "if i was offered the terms of another country , that would be a different matter , but britain 's terms are right for britain .", 
                "he rejected claims that it was hypocritical to share a platform with sadiq khan , the labour mayor of london , on the eu when he criticised him during the mayoral campaign .", 
                "he said : we had a lively election campaign in london , i did n't think it was the right choice some of the people he shared a platform with .", 
                "the right thing for the pm to do is to work together .", 
                "sadiq and i disagree about many things , we 'll try and work together and on this issue of europe we agree .", 
                "we buried our disagreements and appeared on a platform .", 
                "he praised boris johnson , saying he was a very talented politician who had plenty of fuel left in the tank .", 
                "that 's all from me for tonight .", 
                "thanks for the comments ."
