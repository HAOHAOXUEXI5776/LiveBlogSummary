                "i looked up how tax credits were increased over the period they were in government , and quite interestingly it appears just before every election , the labour government increased tax credits dramatically the truth is his government has always used benefits as a way of trying to buy votes .",

                "here are the main points from the number 10 lobby briefing .", 
                "10 downing street neal/afp/getty images downing street said that david cameron hoped that technical talks '' about britain 's eu renegotiation demands would start after this week 's eu summit and that they would probably take several months '' .", 
                "the prime minister 's spokeswoman said : we would like to maintain the momentum on the discussions that we have had so far and therefore pave the way to move towards technical talks following the european council [ this week 's summit ] .", 
                "those talks , one would expect , would take several months .", 
                "that suggests it is possible cameron could be hoping for a deal to be sorted in time for a decision at the eu summit in december .", 
                "the spokeswoman said that cameron discussed this during his recent talks with angela merkel , the german chancellor , and that merkel agreed that technical talks '' would be a good idea .", 
                "the two leaders will have another meeting on wednesday , when cameron travels to berlin for a banquet being held to mark the queen 's state visit .", 
                "at their summit starting on thursday , eu leaders will discuss what form those technical talks '' should take .", 
                "the spokeswoman said that cameron has already spoken to 20 eu leaders about his renegotiation demands ahead of this week 's summit .", 
                "he has not yet spoken to leaders from austria , bulgaria , croatia , greece , lithuania , portugal and malta , but hopes to have bilateral talks with some these figures before the summit gets underway in brussels on thursday .", 
                "downing street confirmed that cameron was not asking for britain to have a veto over eu laws as part of his renegotiation .", 
                "as the telegraph reports today , business for britain says this should be one of his demands .", 
                "but , when asked about this , cameron 's spokeswoman said : if you were effectively seeking a red card for a single , national parliament , then you would effectively be seeking to restore the national veto .", 
                "i have not not seen that on the table .", 
                "cameron was interested in giving national parliaments more power over eu law , she said .", 
                "but he was looking at ideas that would involve national parliaments acting together to block eu laws , not proposals that would involve a single parliament exercising a veto , she said .", 
                "the spokeswoman played down suggests that cameron would propose britain becoming some kind of associate member of the eu .", 
                "according to a sunday times story yesterday , some tories have floated this idea .", 
                "the sunday times said : senior figures have told mps the prime minister 's renegotiation plans go much further than he has publicly admitted , in an attempt to stem growing tory concern that he is not demanding enough from brussels .", 
                "several no 10 officials want to rebadge '' britain 's role in the eu to something like associate membership '' , to demonstrate the uk will have a new relationship with brussels .", 
                "terms like market membership '' , trading membership '' and executive membership '' are all circulating in conservative ranks , designed to reflect britain 's primary interest in the single market and the country 's heritage as a trading nation .", 
                "cameron 's spokeswoman acknowledged that different countries have different levels of involvement with the eu ; for example , not all are members of the euro , or the schengen agreement .", 
                "but she dismissed the suggestion that britain could be anything less than a full member .", 
                "she explained : you are either a member or you are not a member of the eu .", 
                "the spokeswoman said cameron still thought eu treaty change was necessary as part of his renegotiation .", 
                "last week , after meeting cameron , the irish premier enda kenny said cameron had not yet pushed for treaty change .", 
                "today the spokeswoman said that cameron was clear that the changes he was seeking would require treaty change , but that were were differing views as to how you can achieve that '' .", 
                "the spokeswoman said it was nonsense '' to suggest that cameron was seeking to close down the bbc .", 
                "the spokeswoman dismissed claims that knife crime in london was going up because the police have been told to reduce their use of stop and search .", 
                "( see 10.49am . )", 
                "the most recent figures , to the end of december 2014 , show a reduction in recorded knife crime , she said .", 
                "and she said making stop and search intelligence-led was leading to more arrests ."
