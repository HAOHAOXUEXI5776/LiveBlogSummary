                "( full text here . )", 
                "he neatly inverted his perceived negatives - that he 's unconventional , and that he 's expected to lose - by saying that he had defied odds of 200/1 before and that it would take an outsider to shake things up .", 
                "and he answered questions at length from journalists , without resorting to the brittle passive aggression he sometimes deploys in q & as , with a candour that contrasted with theresa may 's fairly dire record when it comes to media scrutiny .", 
                "above all , he sounded decent and passionate .",

                "he replied : the idea that labour is somehow or other a tainted brand - well , there are people in the audience that are wearing badges of keir hardie .", 
                "he was vilified , vilified beyond belief , when he was elected as the first ever labour mp .",

                "maybe it was n't martin luther king , but it was easily the most stirring thing anyone has said in this election campaign so far .", 
                "that is not to say it will prove transformative .", 
                "it is very hard to shift public opinion much during a short election campaign and corbyn 's message will resonate more with labour diehards than with floating voters .", 
                "framing the election as a contest between the establishment and the people obviously fits corbyn 's politics , but it might have worked better in 1989 ; polling evidence suggests that , it is not just the establishment that is happy with theresa may and her government , but the people too .",

                "here are the main points .", 
                "corbyn said the election was a choice between a labour party representing the people and a conservative party representing the establishment .", 
                "the dividing lines in this election could not be clearer from the outset .", 
                "it is the conservatives , the party of privilege and the richest , versus the labour party , the party that is standing up for working people to improve the lives of all .", 
                "it is the establishment versus the people and it is our historic duty to make sure that the people prevail .", 
                "he said that the system was rigged in favour of wealth extractors and , suggesting that labour would introduce much stronger measures to tackle tax avoidance , he said he would make the system work for everyone .",

                "why ?", 
                "because those are the people who are monopolising the wealth that should be shared by each and every one of us in this country .",
