                "he told the commons foreign affairs committee last week that nazanin zaghari-ratcliffe , who has joint british-iranian nationality , was simply teaching people journalism '' when she was arrested .",

                "her family say that this is wrong and that johnson 's comment has raised the possibility of her sentence being increased .", 
                "the most outspoken attack on johnson probably came from the labour mp yvette cooper , who told him : the foreign secretary had a week to correct the record and to apologise over ms zaghari-ratcliffe and he has not done so .", 
                "this is not the first time that the foreign secretary has said things which are inaccurate or which are damaging .", 
                "and he can not keep shrugging them off as a lack of clarity or a careless choice of words .", 
                "in this case there are fears that this could mean the extended incarceration of a british-iranian woman .", 
                "and he will know that the lives and the safety of british citizens across the globe depend on having a foreign secretary who does not bluster and who is not too careless or too lazy to consider his words .", 
                "will the foreign secretary now apologise ?", 
                "he can not be trusted to do his job and he should resign .", 
                "jo swinson , the deputy lib dem leader , used a similar argument .", 
                "the casual disregard for the truth shown by [ johnson ] in his campaign bus last year was bad enough .", 
                "but his carelessness in the case of nazanin zaghari-ratcliffe last wee was unforgivable .", 
                "does the foreign secretary realise that in this role his words have a serious impact .", 
                "this is not a game .", 
                "if he wo n't take his job seriously enough even to read his brief , he should step down and make way for one of his colleagues who will .",

                "what will it take before the prime minister says enough is enough ?", 
                "and the labour former foreign office minister chris bryant said : the honest truth is that i fear , if he ca n't show some contrition today , then the honest truth is he should n't be in his job because our people are n't safe .", 
                "johnson received only very limited support from conservative mps , and at least one of them , anna soubry , accused him of careerism .", 
                "johnson said that his comments to mps last week about zaghari-ratcliffe could have been clearer '' and that , when he spoke about her teaching journalism , he was referring to what she was accused of doing , not what she was doing .", 
                "at no point did he admit that what he said last week was factually wrong .", 
                "in his opening statement he said : the uk government has no doubt that she was on holiday in iran when she was arrested last year and that was the sole purpose of her visit .", 
                "my point was that i disagreed with the iranian view that training journalists was a crime , not that i wanted to lend any credence to iranian allegations that mrs zaghari-ratcliffe had been engaged in such activity .", 
                "i accept that my remarks could have been clearer in that respect and i 'm glad to provide this clarification .", 
                "later , after chris bryant said there was a difference between what johnson said last week and what he was now claiming to have said , johnson replied : i was giving the foreign affairs committee an account of the allegations i 'd personally heard in the course of my intercessions from the iranians .", 
                "i do n't for one minute believe that they are true .",

                "johnson is close to being in the same territory here .", 
                "as the transcript of his comment to the foreign affairs committee shows ( see below ) , johnson said simply that zaghari-ratcliffe was teaching people journalism '' .", 
                "there is nothing in what he said to make the mps think he was referring to what she was alleged to have done .", 
                "at best it could be argued that he is now referring to what he intended to say , rather than what he did say , but he did not explicitly make that argument himself in the chamber today and many observers will conclude that he was simply lying about what happened last week .", 
                "one of the most curious aspects of this is johnson 's refusal to admit that he made a mistake .", 
                "as jack straw argued earlier today ( see 12.07pm ) , if a minister owns up to making an error , colleagues are normally quite supportive .", 
                "so why did n't johnson simply say he misspoke ?", 
                "this is probably a question for the psychiatrists , although given that johnson has now attracted a reputation for saying things which are not true ( which he resents ) , and that his opponents blame him for the dishonest vote leave claim about the eu costing the uk \u00a3 350m a week , he may feel that if he admits to getting this wrong , he will then come under renewed pressure to disown the \u00a3 350m a week slogan , a key plank in the successful leave campaign .", 
                "adam bienkov ( @ adambienkov ) foreign office now say it 's `` absolutely not true '' that boris johnson said zaghari-ratcliffe was teaching journalism .", 
                "here 's the transcript .", 
                "johnson refused a request from the labour mp mike gapes to write to the foreign affairs committee retracting the point he made about zaghari-ratcliffe last week .", 
                "johnson insisted that iran 's foreign minister , mohammad javad zarif , told him in their call earlier that any recent developments '' in the zaghari-ratcliffe case had no connection to what he said about her to the foreign affairs committee .", 
                "in other words , he said his comment had not exacerbated zaghari-ratcliffe 's plight .", 
                "johnson said that he would be visiting iran in the coming weeks .", 
                "he said that he was sorry if the way his comments had been misconstrued '' had caused distress to zaghari-ratcliffe 's family .", 
                "towards the end of his statement , asked if he would apologise to her family , he replied : i 'm sorry if any words of mine have been so taken out of context and so misconstrued as to cause any kind of anxiety for the family of nazanin zaghari-ratcliffe , of course i am .", 
                "he claimed that , by attacking him over zaghari-ratcliffe , labour were deflecting attention from those in the iranian regime who were to blame for her plight .", 
                "and i may say to [ thornberry ] that she has a choice .", 
                "she can choose to heap blame on to a british foreign office that is trying to secure the release of nazanin zaghari-ratcliffe , and in so doing she deflects blame , deflects accountability , from those who are truly responsible for holding that mother in jail .", 
                "the conservative mp anna soubry said after his statement that his lack of contrition was shameful '' .",
