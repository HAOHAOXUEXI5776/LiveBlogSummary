                "election debates are more common in holyrood politics than in westminster politics , as i said earlier , and one of the consequences of that is that they probably make less impact .", 
                "viewers get used to their leaders , and they know what to expect .", 
                "this one did not feel as if was going to change many minds .", 
                "nicola sturgeon is the dominant figure in scottish politics , and she was tonight too .", 
                "she was particularly strong on govan and , even when coming under sustained attack from three of her opponents for her neverendum leanings ( see below ) , she more than held her own .", 
                "ruth davidson , the scottish conservative leader , put up the strongest opposition .", 
                "she was a bit too shouty , and relatively glib on the shipyard jobs , but she was forceful , giving credence to the claim she can make the conservatives the principal opposition to the snp .", 
                "kezia dugdale , the scottish labour leader , seemed to find it harder to differentiate herself from sturgeon and the snp ( not least because tax , where labour has very distinct and progressive policy , did not come up ) .", 
                "she was unpersuasive on the nhs and sometimes she sounded a bit centrist ( see 8.37pm ) , but not in the way that being centrist worked successfully for nick clegg in that first debate in 2010 .", 
                "the scottish lib dem leader willie rennie at least made a mark with a notable soundbite on independence ( see below ) , and patrick harvie was probably best on pfi .", 
                "one final point .", 
                "watching the debate from london , it was notable how little westminster featured .", 
                "there was a stage when devolved politics was to a large extent a competition as to who could complain most about the uk government .", 
                "but that era now seems to have gone .", 
                "and a good thing too .", 
                "here are the key points .", 
                "nicola sturgeon was accused of breaking her promise to honour the result of the independence referendum and of being anti-democratic '' .", 
                "the claim that she had broken a promise was made by ruth davidson , the scottish conservative leader .", 
                "she said sturgeon should not keep open the wound '' caused by the independence referendum in 2014 .", 
                "davidson went on : it 's not good for our country , it 's not good for economy , it 's not good for encouraging jobs and growth and [ sturgeon ] made a promise .", 
                "she signed a binding agreement that she would respect the result .", 
                "and that is important .", 
                "and before the referendum she went around every tv studio she could find and told every person in scotland that it was once in a generation , once in a lifetime .", 
                "she has gone back on both those promises .", 
                "it is not good enough , and it is not up to her to see one opinion poll she likes and say we 're putting this country through it all once more .", 
                "it 's not on .", 
                "willie rennie , the scottish lib dem leader , said sturgeon 's refusal to rule out a second independence referendum was anti-democratic '' .", 
                "he said : we had one of the biggest democratic experiences in our lifetime .", 
                "[ the snp ] celebrated it constantly .", 
                "but now as soon as it 's over and they did not get the result they wanted , they want to do it all over again .", 
                "did they not get the message ?", 
                "we want to stay in the uk .", 
                "respect the result .", 
                "i would even go so far as saying you 're anti-democratic .", 
                "kezia dugdale , the scottish labour leader , also said sturgeon should rule out a second referendum .", 
                "she said : it 's not good enough .", 
                "there is not a mandate for a referendum .", 
                "yet you [ sturgeon ] are in two different papers today saying , 'yes we might have one ' and now saying 'no we wo n't ' , trying to pull the wool over people 's eyes in scotland , when so many people just want to move on from that referendum of the past .", 
                "mocking sturgeon 's claim that she would only hold a second referendum if there was clear evidence of public support for one , dugdale went on : she 's saying , 'let 's trust the pollsters ' .", 
                "if we trusted the pollsters , ed miliband would be prime minister .", 
                "this is no way to govern the country .", 
                "but sturgeon said it would be wrong to rule out a second referendum .", 
                "i think the question for other politicians on this platform is what is it they think gives them the right to stand in the way of a majority .", 
                "scotland will only become independent if a majority backs that .", 
                "that is democracy .", 
                "and none of us should fear the democratic wishes of the people of this country .", 
                "davidson was accused of lying about a government decision that could lead to job losses on the clyde .",

                "she said : the first thing we can do is keep to the timescale that was made to the people who work on the clyde .", 
                "and ruth has quite frankly told a porkie tonight .", 
                "there 's an 18-month delay on work on the clyde and it has to be reversed to honour the promise that was made to people during the referendum .", 
                "sturgeon said the tories had betrayed '' the shipyard workers .", 
                "ruth is really misinformed because the frigate factory , the centre of excellence , that was proposed is one of the things that is not going ahead .",
