                "penny mordaunt , the international development secretary , has accused oxfam of a complete betrayal of trust over the way it handled the haiti sex scandal .",

                "mordaunt said oxfam failed under the watch of barbara stocking and penny lawrence by not reporting and following up incidents of wrongdoing when they occurred .", 
                "she told mps in a statement : they did not provide a full report to the charity commission , they did not provide a full report to their donors , they did not provide any report to prosecuting authorities .", 
                "in my view they misled , quite possibly deliberately .", 
                "even as their report concluded that their investigation could not rule out the allegation that some of the women involved were actually children , they did not think it was necessary to report this to the police either in haiti or the country of origin for those accountable .", 
                "i believe their motivation appears to be the protection of their organisation 's reputation : they put that before those they were there to help and protect - a complete betrayal of trust .", 
                "she also said the uk would stop contributing to un aid programmes unless the un did more to stop its own aid workers engaging in abuse and misconduct .", 
                "she said : we have also been speaking to colleagues across government and beyond about what more we can do to stop exploitation and abuse in the un and broader multilateral system .", 
                "the message from us is clear to all parts of the un : you can either get your house in order or you can prepare to carry on your good work without our money .",

                "jeremy corbyn has ridiculed the idea that he gave information to a communist spy during the cold war , calling the idea nonsense and castigating the newspapers that claimed he did so .", 
                "the home office minister nick hurd has told mps that the government does not currently accept that cannabis has any medicinal benefits but that he will try to help the family of alfie dingley , who has a very rare medical condition and whose parents say they want to treat him with medical cannabis oil .", 
                "in response to an urgent question , hurd said : i personally and the government sympathise deeply with the situation faced by alfie dingley and his family .",
