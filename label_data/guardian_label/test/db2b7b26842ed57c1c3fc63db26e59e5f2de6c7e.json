                "skipping over # deathtodixers session , sarah hanson-young wants to know about the murray-darling basin plan .", 
                "hanson-young : yesterday , fairfax reported that the former water minister barnaby joyce approved the taxpayer-funded purchase of water from one of australia 's biggest cotton producers , eastern australian agriculture , at a price well above what the seller was asking , a whopping 25 % more .", 
                "in a separate incident , in october 2017 , it was reported that when considering a buyback from cotton producer webster limited for a property in western new south wales , the former water minister ignored the department 's own valuation and paid nearly double what the water was worth .", 
                "why is it , minister , that every time the nationals get their hands on the water portfolio , rich cotton producers get richer and every other taxpayer gets ripped off and the river suffered ?", 
                "matt canavan : unfortunately it contained a number of incorrect claims .", 
                "the water purchase from eastern australian agriculture was for water , an amount of water that was greater than five times than the figures or the price that was quoted in the media that you refer to in your answer , senator hanson-young .", 
                "so it is incorrect , it is absolutely incorrect to say that the government paid a price above the seller 's price , and i will take that interjection because you are right senator hanson-young that we have released documents on this matter and those documents , if you had paid the time to take attention to them , did show that the original sale offer that you referred to was very different from the final purchase because those documents show that the amount of water purchase was a lot more than originally offered .", 
                "when you end up getting a lot more , when you end up getting a lot more than was offered , of course the [ inaudible ] had to be higher as well .", 
                "now , mr president , i can assure you and this chamber that the government 's purchase of water have been advised through independent analysis and valuation .", 
                "we are confident that we have purchased water at good value for money for the taxpayer and we are confident that these water purchases will help deliver the environmental objectives and outcome of the murray-darling basin plan that the government is committed to making sure that we do deliver .", 
                "we are trying our best to get this delivery done in the clear politicisation and opposition that we have seen to independent advice from your side and the labor side who have ignored the results of the northern basin review and have put at risk the plan which is to the benefit of the whole murray-darling .", 
                "hanson-young : this is a pattern of behaviour that every time the nationals pay their mates for water , the taxpayer ends up paying more than the water is worth .", 
                "can the minister describe , is this a rort , is it a kickback or is it just good old-fashioned pork-barrelling for the national party at the cost of the taxpayer just to look after your mates ?", 
                "canavan : i do agree with an aspect of senator hanson-young 's question .", 
                "just a tiny aspect .", 
                "there is a pattern of behaviour here , mr president .", 
                "there clearly is a pattern of behaviour .", 
                "there is a pattern of behaviour from the australian greens that they do n't do their homework before they come in here .", 
                "they rely on media articles from the guardian or fairfax without themselves looking at the documents i quoted in my first question are publicly available .", 
                "so , mr president , senator hanson-young can reduce herself to investigate and confected claims , but i would encourage her to look at the documents that the government has transparently released in this case that clearly show that the allegations in the articles senator hanson-young referred to were wrong , incorrect and the government is confident that with are getting value for money for the purchase of water in the murray-darling basin plan .", 
                "hanson-young : my final supplementary is in relation to reports that the head of the northern murray-darling basin group fred hooper was told by an adviser in the minister 's office that he had received $ 10m if he could convince labor to backflip on their opposition to the northern basin review disallowance back if february .", 
                "did the minister approve this $ 180m bribe ?", 
                "who knew about it and did it go to cabinet ?", 
                "canavan : i can [ inform ] senator hanson-young that at no point did we offer funding to this group to secure the amendments .", 
                "the government was in negotiations with both labor and the crossbench to gain support for the murray-darling basin plan .", 
                "those negotiations of course were not successful as the northern basin review amendments were disallowed by the senate .", 
                "mr president , as i was mentioning earlier , it is a shame in my view that those amendments , those northern review basin amendments were n't passed because they were based on independent advice ."
