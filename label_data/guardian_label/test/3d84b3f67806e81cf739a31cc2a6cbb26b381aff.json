                "here is the full text of liam fox 's free trade speech in washington .", 
                "and here are the key points .", 
                "fox , the international trade secretary , said free trade globally was under threat .", 
                "in april , the world trade organisation noted that in 2016 world trade in goods grew by only 1.3 % - the first time since 2001 that trade grew more slowly than gdp .", 
                "this threat to growth and prosperity is going largely unrecognised .", 
                "countries across the world , including the nations of the g7 and the g20 , are allowing trade restrictive practices to establish themselves , limiting access to these leading economies for developed and developing nations alike .", 
                "research by the oecd that shows that protectionist practices have grown since the financial crisis of 2008 .", 
                "by 2010 g7 and g20 countries were estimated to be operating some 300 non-tariff barriers to trade - by 2015 this had mushroomed to over 1200 .", 
                "this matters because the silting up of the global trading environment has implications beyond mere economics .", 
                "for the economic prosperity that a liberal trading system generates is a potent force for social stability .", 
                "he described free trade as an unalloyed good .", 
                "this year marks two centuries since david ricardo introduced his theory of comparative advantage .", 
                "as everyone here will know , the theory states that , if nations are allowed to engage in free and open trade , specialising in the export of certain goods and the import of others to meet their needs , then there is a mutual increase in economic welfare between nations , making those countries richer as a result .", 
                "it is one of the most powerful concepts in economics , described by the economist paul samuelson as the only proposition in all the social sciences that is both true and non-trivial and remains , to this day , the most fundamental justification of the power of free trade .", 
                "since 1817 , the world has changed beyond all recognition , yet the experiences of globalisation , and of technological advances unimaginable in ricardo 's time , have only served to validate his theory .", 
                "he said he thought geographical trade blocs were becoming less relevant .", 
                "conceptually , we need to re-evaluate some of our traditional institutional frameworks .", 
                "in the face of the rapidly changing global economy , this means a re-assessment of the great 20th century structure - the geographic bloc .", 
                "the concept of geographical blocs for the purposes of defence still make sense , although greater flexibility and wider , more diverse global alliances will be necessary to navigate the multiplicity of the security elements of the globalised economy .", 
                "for trade , however , the case is less clear .", 
                "the more mature an economy becomes , and the more it diversifies into services rather than goods , then this offers new opportunities on top of those traditionally available through a geographically contiguous trade bloc .", 
                "for the most advanced economies like the united states , or the uk , where almost 80 % of our economic activity is services-based , we can afford to seek closer partnerships with those whose demands complement our output , not necessarily those who are geographically proximate .", 
                "as i have often said , if francis fukuyama had called his book 'the end of geography ' not 'the end of history ' it would have been much closer to describing the world in which we now find ourselves .", 
                "( fox is saying this because he is keen to challenge the idea that geography means the uk should be part of a european trade bloc .", 
                "economists who argue that the uk will suffer significant economic loss when it leaves the single market often rely on gravity modelling , which assumes distance is a key factor in trade . )", 
                "he said that on tuesday he would publish a report intended to show how important trade with the uk was to every congressional district in america .", 
                "tomorrow , i will launch a report that details the uk 's trade and investment relationship with each of the 435 congressional districts within the united states .", 
                "the report will detail each district 's goods and services trade flows with the uk , identify how many jobs are supported by these investments , and detail the top uk companies in each district .", 
                "for the first time , each member of the house of representatives will have a snapshot of the importance of uk trade to their district .", 
                "equally , we will be able to see where the opportunities lie to strengthen our existing partnerships or forge ahead with new , mutually beneficial , ones .",
