                "the first line of labour 's first budget , it was also revealed , will declare that it cuts the deficit every year '' and every subsequent budget will have to abide by this commitment which will be verified by the obr .", 
                "though it is uncertain whether voters will believe labour 's promises on the economy ( the conservatives are still viewed my most as the trusted party on this issue ) , the verdict on milband 's speech and q & a as a whole was highly positive .",

                "because political interviews mostly consist of politicians saying what you expect them to say , but when they do n't , and when a figure like balls is saying something counter-intuitive , that 's when it all starts getting exciting .", 
                "it can also make a difference .", 
                "one of the key moments in the 1997 general election campaign was when gordon brown went on the today programme and announced that labour was committed to not raising the basic or top rate of income tax for a full five years ( something that at that stage even the tories were not promising , i think ) .",

                "with the conservatives ( supposedly the party of fiscal rectitude ) committed to an unfunded \u00a3 8bn increase in nhs spending , labour ( supposedly the party of irresponsible spending ) is refusing to match this .", 
                "but is this a potential breakthrough moment , as important as that 1997 pledge ?", 
                "probably not .", 
                "although it is undoubtedly significant , i can think of three reasons why it is worth keeping this in perspective .", 
                "1 - counter-intuitive declarations are only effective if voters believe them .", 
                "as patrick wintour explains in the guardian today , the polls suggest that , whatever george osborne and balls say , voters still trust the tories more on the economy .",

                "although balls is not formally committing himself to spending an extra \u00a3 8bn on the nhs ( which is the sum nhs england says it needs ) , he is also strongly hinting he will find the money .",

                "balls rejected jim murphy 's suggestion that , under labour , there would be no further cuts in scotland after 2015-16 .", 
                "in a scottish leaders ' debate on tuesday last week , and in another debate yesterday , murphy , the labour leader in scotland , suggested that there would be no further cuts after next year , saying the institute for fiscal studies had said they would not be required under labour 's plans .", 
                "balls said murphy was responding to claims that labour had signed up to cuts worth \u00a3 30bn .",

                "we will have cuts in our non-protected areas , outside health and education , as part of getting the deficit down , alongside tax increases for people on the highest incomes , the top rate going up to 50p .", 
                "those spending cuts are , of course , uk wide .", 
                "but what we 're going to do is have sensible spending cuts outside [ protected ] areas .",

                "yes , there will be cuts outside [ protected ] areas across all these budgets which will apply in england and in scotland .", 
                "but alongside that in our manifesto today we are also setting out ways in which , financed by tax changes , for example the mansion tax for the national health service , we can increase spending on our priorities .", 
                "that will deliver , in 2015-16 , \u00a3 800m extra for scotland , because that is their share of that money which is going for the bank bonus tax , for youth jobs , for more childcare , or for the nhs .", 
                "whether or not the overall scottish budget is cut depends upon whether or not that \u00a3 800m which is financed and extra is more than or less than our [ unprotected ] cuts .", 
                "and that will depend on the scale of the [ unprotected ] cuts .", 
                "balls said cuts for scotland would be worse under the conservatives or the snp .", 
                "i ca n't say to scotland that you are going to be exempt from spending cuts in the unprotected areas .", 
                "but they are sensible and they are absolutely in marked contrast to what the tories are proposing , because they want to have double the spending cuts next year , and also the snp , because what we exposed last week is the snp both wo n't match our manifesto pledges , but also their fiscal autonomy within the uk is actually fiscal austerity .", 
                "it would mean a massive cut to spending in scotland .",
