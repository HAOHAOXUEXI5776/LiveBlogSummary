                "today marked the beginning of the general election campaign .", 
                "as parliament was dissolved , party leaders from across the political spectrum put their promises and ideas to the british public , including the prime minister , who outlined his plans in a statement outside no 10 : the general election will be held on may 7th .", 
                "until that day i will be going to all four corners and all four nations of our united kingdom , with one clear message .", 
                "together we are turning our country around and for the sake of you , your family , and your children 's future we have got to see this through .", 
                "the campaign starting means that no uk citizen has a representative in parliament anymore .", 
                "this is because when parliament is dissolved , the role of mp ceases to exist until the election of a new house of commons at the general election .", 
                "mps hoping to get re-elected might stay in touch with former constituents , but this is not done in any professional capacity .", 
                "the big a car carrying british prime minister david cameron leaves buckingham palace .", 
                "halle'n/afp/getty images david cameron went to buckingham palace today to mark the formal dissolution of parliament .", 
                "it was more an act of theatre than anything else - traditionally the prime minister marks the start of a general election by going to see the queen to seek the dissolution of parliament .", 
                "but , under the fixed-term parliament act , that is unnecessary , because the dissolution of parliament was ordained by law .", 
                "nick clegg , in his capacity as lord president of the privy council , also went to buckingham palace , where he formally advised the queen on the date for the summoning of the new parliament ( 18 may ) .", 
                "diary david cameron launched the general election campaign with a warning in downing street that the british people face a stark choice between a safe and secure future under the tories or economic chaos under labour .", 
                "in a short statement outside number 10 , he said : you can choose [ cameron and the conservatives ] or you can choose the economic chaos of ed miliband 's britain over \u00e2\u00a3 3000 in higher taxes for every working family to pay for more welfare and out of control spending .", 
                "debt will rise and jobs will be lost as a result .", 
                "ed miliband pays lip service to working people while planning to hike taxes and increase debt .", 
                "paul johnson , the director of the institute for fiscal studies , later dismissed cameron 's claim , stating : the conservatives have had to make quite a lot of assumptions to get quite such a big number .", 
                "the first thing to bear in mind is this is not an annual number .", 
                "this is a number that is cumulated over at least four years so they are not claiming that this is the amount of additional tax you have to pay in any one year .", 
                "and they are also only taking working households so they are getting a big number and dividing it by a relatively small number of households .", 
                "the second point is they have assumed that labour is going to follow a certain set of fiscal targets .", 
                "actually labour has been pretty vague about exactly what fiscal targets it will try and achieve , but what the conservatives assumed is that labour want to get to a current budget balance by 2017 so that requires a set of cuts or tax rises by then .", 
                "ed miliband gave a speech at the labour business manifesto launch , where he said that his plan is based on the idea that britain will only succeed when every worker succeeds , and that he wants to build on the great strength of british business .", 
                "he also said that tory eu policy represents a clear and present danger to british jobs , british business , british families and british prosperity .", 
                "our long term future lies inside , not outside , the european union .", 
                "there could be nothing worse for our country or for our great exporting businesses than playing political games with our membership of the eu .", 
                "david cameron used to understand that .", 
                "but in the past five years our place in the european union has become less and less secure .", 
                "[ cameron ] came to power promising to stop his party banging on about europe .", 
                "now if he carries on this way , he 'll have us inside the european union banging on the door to leave .", 
                "or even worse , outside the european union , banging on the door to be let back in .", 
                "ed balls , the shadow chancellor , slapped down labour 's vice election chair for suggesting the party could borrow more for investment .", 
                "yesterday lucy powell told the sunday politics that labour was committed to balancing the books for day-to-day spending but that there could be some investment borrowing under its fiscal rules .", 
                "the institute for fiscal studies has said this could allow the party to borrow as much as \u00e2\u00a3 30bn , and the conservatives have been treating that figure as a firm spending commitment .", 
                "but balls said that there were no plans in the manifesto for extra spending that would require extra borrowing .", 
                "he said : we have said very clearly we are going to get the current budget not only into balance but surplus in the next parliament - more than covering day-to-day spending .", 
                "we 're going to get the national debt falling in the next parliament and we will do that as soon as we can in the next parliament and because we will inherit a deficit which is going to be very large , there are no proposals in our manifesto which will involve any additional spending - current spending or investment spending - that will need to be covered by additional borrowing .", 
                "labour played down complaints from some firms about their being quoted in a labour advert in today 's financial times warning about the risks posed by the planned conservatives referendum on the eu .", 
                "chuka umunna , the shadow business secretary , said : we spoke to all the businesses who were quoted in the advertisement and all we have done is cite what they have said publicly i think this is a little bit of a storm in a tea cup .", 
                "if you make public statements about important areas of public policy .", 
                "nick clegg refused to rule out the lib dems backing david cameron 's plans for an in/out referendum on the eu before the end of 2017 , despite some figures , like vince cable and ed davey , suggesting that having a referendum would create so much business uncertainty that it would be hard for the lib dems to support it .", 
                "natalie bennett , the green party leader , launched her party 's election campaign by saying the greens would represent people sick of business-as-usual politics .", 
                "she added : we 'll be the only party offering changes that genuinely reconfigure our economy to work for everyone , not just those at the top .", 
                "we 're the only ones demanding a genuinely public nhs - free from profit-making companies .", 
                "and , of course , we promise the bold steps required to tackle the looming climate crisis .", 
                "gordon brown said labour would spend \u00e2\u00a3 800m more on services in scotland than the snp .", 
                "he later told my colleague libby brookws that the snp 's claim to be a party of social justice had been exposed .", 
                "he said : once people see the detail : let 's be honest , there is no more money for the national health service in scotland for the coming year other than by cuts from somewhere else .", 
                "zero additional spending means zero additional spending .", 
                "it could n't be clearer .", 
                "the important thing that people will come to realise is that it 's all talk , bluster and rhetoric .", 
                "the reason why the snp talk about coalitions and deals all the time is that the ca n't actually afford to talk about the real social issues because they do n't have the money or the policies to deal with them .", 
                "nigel farage launched ukip 's pledge card in the middle of a westminster street , where there was a big scrum around him .", 
                "our political correspondent rowena mason was there , and said : ukip leader nigel farage brushed off suggestions his party is losing momentum as he unveiled five key pledges on leaving the eu , controlling immigration , more cash for the nhs , cutting foreign aid , and easing tax for those on the minimum wage .", 
                "he held the launch in the middle of a road smith square , westminster , flanked by policy chief suzanne evans , economics spokesman patrick o'flynn and mp mark reckless - but no douglas carswell .", 
                "farage also said he has had informal conversations with tory mps about going into a coalition together .", 
                "boris johnson spoke about the moral purpose of capitalism at the legatum institute , saying it helps increase life expectancy and therefore people will live longer under the tories .", 
                "he also attacked labour for wanting to take the country back to the grim 1970s which was a time of racism and trade-union dominated politics , ukip for idealising a non-existent 50s , the lib dems for wanting any time when their polling was better and the greens seeking a return to some time un the bronze age .", 
                "george osborne said the tories will not publish details of their planned welfare cuts until after the election .", 
                "appearing on channel 4 news , the chancellor said his party would set out how they intend to achieve the planned 12 billion in savings from the welfare budget in a summer spending review , if they are returned to power in may .", 
                "david cameron spoke at a rally in chippenham , where he admitted he 's not the perfect prime minister but that he has a record to be proud of .", 
                "he said voters faced a stark choice on may 7 between his great team and the one headed by ed miliband , asked whether people wanted george osborne in the treasury or ed balls , who broke the banks , and praised home secretary theresa may as preferable to labour shadow yvette cooper .", 
                "he added : there are only two people that can walk through that door in number 10 in 39 days time - there is me or ed miliband , the guy who even forgot to mention the deficit and who has opposed every single decision we have taken , every single tough call we have made .", 
                "john mcdonnell , the chair of the socialist campaign group of labour mps and former leadership contender , said that up to 40 labour mps would vote against a budget or spending review that includes cuts .", 
                "mcdonnell said there has been a shift in the labour leadership 's thinking and recognised an alternative needed to be offered instead of an austerity-lite approach .", 
                "grant shapps responded : this is the true face of ed miliband 's labour party - they 're addicted to more wasteful spending and more taxes .", 
                "if ed miliband becomes prime minister he 'll be carried there by alex salmond , bankrolled by len mccluskey and pushed around by his own backbenchers .", 
                "it would cause chaos for britain .", 
                "the big issue polling trends show that labour and the conservatives remain pretty much tied at the moment .", 
                "a recent poll by yougov had labour taking a four-point lead , and another one by comres showed the opposite with the tories ahead by four .", 
                "lord ashcroft 's weekly poll , released earlier today , put the conservatives two points ahead .", 
                "as my colleague alberto nardelli writes : as always , it 's best to look at the trend instead of the poll we like best .", 
                "the underlying remains unchanged : labour and the conservatives are virtually tied in the polls , and our latest projection has the conservatives winning 277 seats , labour 269 , the snp 53 , the liberal democrats 25 , ukip four and the greens one .", 
                "both main parties remain well short of an outright majority .", 
                "one number to keep an eye on over the next five weeks is the combined labour-snp share of seats .", 
                "it 's currently projected at 322 seats - anything above this , and cameron would n't have the numbers to form a government if the mps of both parties were to vote him down .", 
                "because of this factor , cameron needs the polls to change substantially more between now and election than miliband does if he is to stand a chance of forming a stable government .", 
                "you can see the most current poll projections here , and here .",
