                "good morning and thanks for the donation , there was a glorious sunrise over canberra , combined with a full moon so perhaps the stars are aligned for political donation reform .",

                "if you watched the four corners episode last night , you will be aware of the many reasons why the public are losing faith in the political process .", 
                "blogmistress katharine murphy wrote up the newest part of this sorry saga : the managing director of transfield holdings , luca belgiorno-nettis , says his company made political donations because it was fairly plain that that bought access to politicians and created opportunities to influence events .", 
                "belgiorno-nettis told monday 's four corners program political donations were like the latin saying do ut des , you give in order to have given back .", 
                "i think it was fairly plain that [ donations ] bought access in terms of the ability to simply be able to knock on the door and make the phone call and have the meeting with the political masters to voice whatever concerns that we might have , or indeed just to explore further relationships and further potential opportunities , said the prominent businessman , who has now renounced donations and founded the newdemocracy foundation .", 
                "he also told the program it would be difficult to deny that the company 's political donations helped the company gain an unsolicited contract worth $ 750m to build the harbour tunnel in sydney .", 
                "former nsw liberal party minister , federal and state party fundraiser michael yabsley said he knew in some cases donors banned at the state level were sent to the federal liberal fundraising body , the free enterprise foundation .", 
                "murph followed up with a comment .", 
                "i 've been arguing for reform to the donations and disclosure regime for many years for two reasons : transparency manifestly benefits the public interest , and getting the money out of the system might help the political class focus on the interests of the people they are elected to serve : the australian voters , rather than viewing politics as being little more than a series of arbitrations with cashed-up rent seekers .", 
                "but yabsley 's point is the insider 's point .", 
                "he 's focused on reputational risk : he thinks it has now gotten to the point where the rolling controversies around the political fundraising system is damaging politics itself , and also damaging the reputations of the players that seek to influence it .", 
                "in terms of hoary old chestnuts , political donations is up there .", 
                "it came up in 2009 , when then queensland premier anna bligh banned state mps attending party fundraisers with business people and tried to stop business observers paying thousands of dollars in fees to attend the alp national conference .", 
                "i think it is time for us to really overhaul the entire system of political fundraising .", 
                "it 's gone down a certain path , it 's been doing it for a long time , i do n't think there 's any real hard evidence that it has resulted in any form of corruption .", 
                "but i think it 's just as much about people 's perceptions .", 
                "if the public feel that they are not getting influence in the same way that other members of the community are , then that is not a healthy democracy .", 
                "so , let 's look for a better way of doing it .", 
                "it so happens at the time , a younger malcolm turnbull was federal opposition leader .", 
                "he reassured the 7.30 report 's kerry o'brien that he was in favour of reform on campaign finance .", 
                "they know that there is a leader of the opposition , a leader of the liberal party , who is passionately committed and has been for many years to root and branch campaign finance reform .", 
                "so i 'm - i will be a willing partner in bi-partisan reform of campaign finance .", 
                "but we 've got to get on with it .", 
                "back then , the then prime minister kevin rudd was trying to get labor 's legislation through to cap the disclosure threshold at $ 1,000 , ban political donations from overseas or from non-australian companies and reduce disclosure timeframes from 12 months to six months .", 
                "the liberal party blocked it in the senate .", 
                "but there was one other thing turnbull told o'brien : i do not believe businesses and companies or trade unions should be allowed to donate to political parties ."
