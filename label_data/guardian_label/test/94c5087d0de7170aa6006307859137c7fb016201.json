                "here are the main points from michel barnier 's press conference and david davis 's evidence to the lords eu committee .", 
                "barnier , the eu 's chief brexit negotiator , insisted that the uk would have to obey eu rules during the transition , without exception .", 
                "( see 4.52pm . )", 
                "at one point he said : during transition the uk will continue to take part in the single market , to take part in the customs union .", 
                "it will continue to have all the economic benefits therefore it must also apply all the eu rules .", 
                "the single market can not be a la carte .", 
                "davis , the brexit secretary , indicated that the uk did want the power to opt out of new eu laws during the transition , or at least to object to them .", 
                "he said he had not raised this issue yet , but expected to bring it up soon .", 
                "we will start talking about that next week .", 
                "we will face an objection against it , i 'm sure .", 
                "we take the view that it is not particularly good democratic practice to have your country accept without any say-so anything , and particularly if the eu takes it upon itself to do something which is actively disadvantageous to a major british industry , or something like that .", 
                "davis cited this as one of several areas where the uk and the eu would not agree initially on the transition .", 
                "asked to summarise the problem areas , he replied .", 
                "there will be an argument about the right to negotiate free trade agreements .", 
                "there will be an argument , i 'm sure , about the issue of whether or not we can object to new laws that we have n't had a say in .", 
                "there will be discussions about issues like representation on technical committee .", 
                "bear in mind , we are very often the prime mover in areas like aviation , pharmaceuticals ; the regulators tend to be brits because we are good at that .", 
                "what else ?", 
                "i guess those are the main ones .", 
                "matthew holehouse , mlex 's brexit correspondent , reckons that the gap between what barnie is saying and what davis is saying is not as large as some people are assuming .", 
                "matthew holehouse ( @ mattholehouse ) i do n't think uk and eu are necessarily as quite as far apart as portrayed on implementing new acquis .", 
                "remember davis called for a `` dialogue '' , not a veto .", 
                "david davis .", 
                "tv davis hinted that the government is working on the end of the year , not october , as the deadline for the brexit withdrawal agreement .", 
                "he told peers : mr barnier has said that he hopes to conclude [ in ] october , the autumn of this year .", 
                "we are also seeking , of course , the future relationship and the withdrawal agreement in parallel .", 
                "that may push it a little later , because we will not want to sign the withdrawal agreement until we have got the substance of the future relationship ironed out as well .", 
                "so the last quarter of the year i think is about where we are aiming at .", 
                "barnier said he would not be happy about extending the talks deadline .", 
                "when he was asked about what davis had told the lords , he said that the deal would be a major , historic treaty and that time would be needed for it to be ratified .", 
                "it was the british who wanted to leave at the end of march 2019 , he said .", 
                "working backwards , to ensure there was enough time for ratification , the deal should be agreed in october , he said .", 
                "we can not go too close to the end of the year .", 
                "it is not a matter of being too fussy about a week or so .", 
                "but we 're working towards the end of october .", 
                "barnier said , during the transition , the uk would have to comply with the terms of the eu 's trade deals with other countries but that it might not get the benefits when its own goods were exported .", 
                "he made this point in his opening statement .", 
                "he said : as part of the transition , the uk will remain bound by the obligations stemming from all existing eu international agreements , for instance on trade and aviation .", 
                "this is crucial for the good functioning of the single market and the customs union .", 
                "and we can agree on this in the article 50 agreement between the eu and the uk .", 
                "but we can not ensure in the article 50 agreement that the uk keeps the benefits from these international agreements .", 
                "our partners around the world may have their own views on this , for instance the 70 countries covered by trade deals .", 
                "this centre for european reform briefing explains this issue in more detail .", 
                "here is an excerpt from the report , written by sam lowe .", 
                "as well as binding the uk to the eu 's single market and customs union , the draft proposal seeks to ensure that the uk continues to apply the bloc 's external tariff rates and performs the same border checks with non-eu countries .", 
                "this could easily result in a scenario in which uk exporters are no longer able to take advantage of the eu 's existing free trade agreements , but exporters located in countries with eu ftas [ free trade agreements ] would continue to benefit from preferential access to the uk market on the same terms as now .", 
                "to give a practical example : during the proposed transition , korean car exporters would still be able to sell cars into the uk without being subject to border tariffs under the provisions of the eu-south korea free trade agreement .", 
                "uk car exporters selling into korea , on the other hand , would no longer be covered by the agreement and would face korea 's tariffs of 8 per cent .", 
                "barnier said the brexit transition deal was conditional on there being an overall withdrawal deal .", 
                "he said : in the course of this second phase we will have to translate into legal terms the commitments that we had in the joint report .", 
                "these have to be put into legally binding language .", 
                "that is a sine qua non condition for progress in this second phase .", 
                "it is all a big package .", 
                "if we have no agreement on the withdrawal issues there will be no transition .", 
                "barnier said the uk needed to say what it wanted from brexit .", 
                "he said : it is very important that the uk voices its position on what it wants in this future relationship .", 
                "davis dismissed as bogus claims that the uk was interested in getting a three-year transition , not a two-year one .", 
                "this has been claimed in press reports over the weekend .", 
                "davis said it has been a spectacular weekend for bogus stories ' .", 
                "he went on : twenty one months may be fine , plus or minus a few months is neither here nor there .", 
                "but we are not talking about extending to three years .",

                "this will be a negotiation and there will naturally be some distance in the detail of our starting positions .", 
                "downing street played down suggestions that brexit transition might be extended to three years .", 
                "at the weekend peter foster and gordon rayner in the daily telegraph ( paywall ) said britain has discreetly begun sounding out senior eu figures over whether transition could be extended to about three years , possibly ending at the end of december 2021 , instead of the end of march 2021 as the government is current proposing .", 
                "asked about this , the spokesman said that may had made it clear she wanted a time-limited transition lasting around two years .", 
                "the spokesman claimed that may is still interested in creating dispute resolution mechanism that would prevent the uk having to obey the european court of justice for the whole of the brexit transition .", 
                "may floated this idea in her florence speech , in a move that seemed intended to counter brexiter objections to the uk being subject to the jurisdiction of the ecj for the whole of the two-year transition .", 
                "but david davis , the brexit secretary , did not mention this idea either in his evidence to the commons brexit committee last week or in the speech he gave on transition policy on friday .", 
                "asked if the plan had been dropped , the spokesman said that if such a dispute resolution body could be set up soon , then that was still something the government would like to do .", 
                "the spokesman said the cabinet 's 10-strong eu exit and trade ( strategy and negotiations ) sub-committee , the government 's most important brexit committee , met this morning .", 
                "he would not say any more about the meeting , and would not comment on a report saying ministers on the committee are being shown government impact assessments describing the impact of different brexit outcomes on the economy .", 
                "in today 's times ( paywall ) sam coates says : the analysis , drawn up using contributions from across whitehall , is likely to cause a dispute since cabinet ministers expect it to show that hard brexit options will stall the economy for years to come .", 
                "the impact analysis will put the cat among the pigeons , assuming you believe in experts , one government source said .", 
                "the spokesman also refused to respond to questions about whether or not the impact assessments should be published .", 
                "the spokesman refused to comment on reports at the weekend saying may has ditched plans for a major speech in february that where she was expected to set out what sort of brexit end state the uk wants .",

                "he said may is planning to deliver a speech at the munich security conference in february , but that will focus on the security aspects of brexit , he suggested .", 
                "the spokesman said that in the course of the negotiations with the eu it will of course be clear what the uk is seeking to achieve , but he would not say when the government would set this out .",
