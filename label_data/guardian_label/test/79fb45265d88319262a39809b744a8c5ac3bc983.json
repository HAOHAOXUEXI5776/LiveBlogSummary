                "how long the period is should be determined simply by how long it will take to prepare and implement the new processes and new systems that will underpin that future partnership .",

                "the eu wants the uk to contribute to long-term spending commitments agreed by the eu but not covered in the current budget , and this is what may seemed to be referring to when she spoke of the uk and the eu working together in ways that promote the long-term economic development of our continent '' .",

                "at the time no 10 insisted this was a misunderstanding of what was in the letter , but the notion that britain could use security as a bargaining chip has persisted .",

                "one way of approaching this question is to put forward a stark and unimaginative choice between two models : either something based on european economic area membership ; or a traditional free-trade agreement , such as that the eu has recently negotiated with canada .", 
                "i do n't believe either of these options would be best for the uk or best for the european union .",

                "but compared with what exists between britain and the eu today , it would nevertheless represent such a restriction on our mutual market access that it would benefit neither of our economies .", 
                "not only that , it would start from the false premise that there is no pre-existing regulatory relationship between us .", 
                "and precedent suggests that it could take years to negotiate .",
