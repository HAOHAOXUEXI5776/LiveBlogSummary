                "pay must be more closely aligned with long term performance so a labour government will embark on a serious and far reaching programme of reform in the banking sector .", 
                "we will reintroduce our successful tax on bankers bonuses which generated over \u00a3 3bn in 2010 .",

                "on the contrary , it looks as though zero hours contracts are becoming a more ingrained feature of the uk 's employment landscape , which is likely to buttress poor pay and working conditions in the lower reaches of the labour market .", 
                "although the ons is uncertain how much of the 19 % annual increase from 586,000 to 697,000 in the number of people employed on zero hours contracts is due to increased reporting by people previously unaware of their contractual status , the big leap in public awareness of zero hours contracts was in 2012 which suggests that most of the rise between 2013 and 2014 is probably due to greater use by employers .", 
                "but any rise is disappointing given the expectation that a tightening labour market would diminish use of these contracts .", 
                "it can of course be argued that , despite the apparent increase , the share of zero hours contracts in total employment remains relatively small and that some people ( especially students and older workers ) like the flexibility they provide .", 
                "what this ignores , however , is that the ability of employers to hire people in this way undermines the bargaining ability of other workers , thereby dampening pressure for improved pay and conditions at the bottom end of the labour market .", 
                "the practice also undermines the spirit of the statutory national minimum wage , since although people employed on zero hours contracts are entitled to the minimum wage for the hours they work the lack of guaranteed hours is a source of income insecurity .",
