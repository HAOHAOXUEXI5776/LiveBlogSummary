                "although the three main party leaders signed a joint declaration on this in august , there has been little or no discussion within the parties outside scotland on these plans and - rightly or wrongly - the impression has been created that cameron , miliband and clegg okayed this far-reaching constitutional change in a panic last weekend after one bad yougov poll .",
