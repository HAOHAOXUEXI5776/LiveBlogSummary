                "britain has taken a significant , although largely symbolic , step closer to brexit after the mps voted by a majority of almost 400 to back theresa may 's plan to trigger article 50 by the end of march .", 
                "in two votes , labour and conservative mps joined forces to back a labour motion saying the government should publish a plan for leaving the eu before article 50 is invoked , and a government amendment saying the government should invoke article 50 by 31 march .", 
                "the vote is not technically binding on the government , but it is the first time parliament has backed may 's brexit timetable , which would lead to the uk being out of the eu by the end of march 2019 ( assuming that the two-year withdrawal process does not get extended . )", 
                "labour has set out its conditions for supporting the triggering of article 50 .", 
                "in his speech sir keir starmer , the shadow brexit secretary , set out five conditions for the government 's brexit plan .", 
                "( see 4.41pm . )", 
                "unless the government wins its supreme court appeal there will have to be an article 50 bill and starmer said , if the government 's brexit plan did not fulfil his conditions , labour would try to impose these terms on the government by amending the bill .", 
                "on sky news a moment ago , asked what would happen if the government did not cooperate , he said the government would face further challenge from labour .", 
                "he refused to elaborate on what this might mean , although ministers know they could be vulnerable to defeat because several dozen tory mps agree with labour in favouring a soft brexit .", 
                "if there is an article 50 bill , the government wants to make it as hard to amend as possible , to minimise the chances of being defeated in this way .", 
                "labour 's decision to back the government amendment has triggered a significant rebellion .", 
                "some 23 labour mps defied the whip and voted against the amendment on the first vote .", 
                "it is claimed that another 56 labour mps abstained , by not voting without being given permission to be absent .", 
                "at the start of the week the conservative party was said to be facing a rebellion , but only one conservative mp , ken clarke .", 
                "voted against the whip on the first vote .", 
                "the labour mps who defied the whip did so because they thought it was wrong to agree to triggering article 50 by the end of march when the government still has not said what it wants .", 
                "labour denies offering the government a blank cheque , and starmer stressed that his support for triggering article 50 was conditional .", 
                "david davis , the brexit secretary , has refused to commit the government to publishing a white paper on its brexit plan , suggesting that the plan that does get published will be a minimalist one .", 
                "he has also refused to commit to giving mps a vote on whether or not to leave the customs union .",

                "the government are responsible for all policy decisions and policy costings , but it is for the obr to provide independent scrutiny and certification of the government 's policy costings fourthly , the plan must have enough detail to enable the relevant authorities in scotland , wales and northern ireland to be assured that their particular and specific concerns are addressed .", 
                "other members will speak about those concerns far more authoritatively than i can , but they include concerns about the single market and , in northern ireland , concerns about the border and related issues .",

                "that is an important point , because the future of this country is bound up with the negotiations , and it is wrong in principle for the government to act solely for the 52 % to base its approach on the 52 % or a group within the 52 % ."

                "speaking to journalists in edinburgh at the end of a two-day visit to scotland , the shadow brexit secretary said : it 's difficult to see how having any part of the uk in the single market and another part out would work in practice .", 
                "that reinforces that there has to be a uk approach [ to negotiations ] from the start .", 
                "those that are advocating a different set of arrangements have to put more meat on the bones as to how it would work in practice .",

                "asked about the scottish government 's attempts to explore different arrangements since the june referendum , starmer insisted that the prime minister should be getting the best deal for the whole of the uk .",

                "but at the beginning of november , when pressed to clarify labour 's position after jeremy corbyn and tom watson contradicted one another on the party 's approach to article 50 , he said : we are clear that we need the fullest possible access to the single market , that we should be in the customs union , and that there should be special arrangements for northern ireland , wales and scotland .",
