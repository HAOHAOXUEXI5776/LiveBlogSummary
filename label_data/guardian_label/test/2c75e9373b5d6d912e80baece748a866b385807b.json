                "theresa may became prime minister this summer with voters having only a relatively hazy view as to what her views are .", 
                "she had been home secretary for six years but she is something of a political introvert and as a cabinet minister she only gave speeches addressing matters outside her home office brief on perhaps two or three occasions .", 
                "during the conservative leadership contest she was all set to elaborate on her thinking during the final stage of the contest .", 
                "but then andrea leadsom pulled out , with the result that only one of the series of speeches may was planning , the birmingham economy speech , actually got delivered .", 
                "so that is one reason why this promises to be more interesting than the average conservative party conference .", 
                "normally , if the party leader is prime minister , we already know quite a lot about them .", 
                "this week , and particularly in her keynote speech on wednesday , may has the chance to flesh out her politics and to present herself to the country she runs in a sharper focus .", 
                "but there is second issue that will dominate proceedings too : brexit .", 
                "over the summer ministers have said very little about how they will proceed with the eu withdrawal talks , beyond the vacuous and tautologicial brexit means brexit '' .", 
                "this week , and particularly this afternoon , when the conference holds a session on brexit , may and her team are going to have to say a little more .", 
                "equally importantly , conference fringe meetings on the subject are going to give members and mps the chance to set out what their brexit demands are .", 
                "overnight may has announced that brexit will involve a great repeal '' bill .", 
                "here is the our story on this .", 
                "theresa may to propose 'great repeal ' bill to unwind eu laws read more and here is an extract .", 
                "may and the brexit secretary , david davis , will use the opening day of the conference to detail plans for their great repeal '' bill that will allow britain to take back control '' of its legislation .", 
                "the bill will repeal the 1972 european communities act , which gives direct effect to all eu law , and at the same time convert brussels regulations into domestic law .", 
                "this will give parliament the power to un the laws it wants to keep , remove or amend at a later date , in a move that could be welcomed by mps who are keen to have a say over the terms of brexit .", 
                "the move is also designed to give certainty to businesses and protection for workers ' rights that are enshrined in eu law .", 
                "davis will say : to those who are trying to frighten british workers , saying , 'when we leave , employment rights will be eroded ' , i say firmly and unequivocally , 'no , they wo n't . ' ''",
