                "here are the main points from david davis 's marathon brexit statement .", 
                "david davis was widely criticised by labour and snp mps for being unable to give details of the government 's brexit plans as he used a commons statement to set out the process the government will follow as it negotiates eu withdrawal .", 
                "in her response emily thornberry , the shadow brexit secretary , said : what we 've heard instead has n't been a strategy , it has n't been a thought out plan , it 's just been more empty platitudes from a government that just continues to make it up as it goes along .", 
                "davis gave the clearest sign yet that the government will abandon single market membership as part of its brexit settlement .", 
                "in response to a question from the labour eurosceptic kate hoey , who asked davis to accept that it was not necessary to be a member of the single market to access it , davis agreed .", 
                "he replied : access to the single market is not really up for grabs .", 
                "it is there for everybody .", 
                "there are many , many countries , many countries outside the european union , that do a better job , frankly , of exporting to the single market than we do , even without a trade arrangement .", 
                "so of course we want to have access to the single market .", 
                "we do n't need to be a member of it to do it .", 
                "indeed , being a member of it has caused some of the problems of sovereignty that this referendum was driven by .", 
                "later , when the pro-european tory anna soubry asked davis to confirm that he was willing to abandon single market membership , davis replied : what i 'm saying is that this government is looking at every option .", 
                "but the simple truth is that if a requirement of membership is giving up control of our borders , i think that makes it very improbable .", 
                "davis said he did not accept the claim that there was a trade off between getting control of immigration and protecting free trade by remaining in the single market .", 
                "it was a false choice , he argued , because it was in the interests of both sides to promote free trade .", 
                "( see 4.46pm . )", 
                "he said the government 's post-brexit immigration system would be more rigorous '' than a points-based system .", 
                "he said theresa may was very clear '' in her comments in china earlier .", 
                "she was concerned that a points-based system was too open-ended , that it did not actually put a control on the number of people coming to the uk .", 
                "and therefore she wanted something which sounded like it would be more rigorous not less .", 
                "he said he would oppose any attempt to undermine workers ' rights as part of the brexit settlement .", 
                "he said this in response to a question from labour 's angela eagle ( see 5.05pm ) using language very similar to that he used in his conservativehome article in july .", 
                "in that article he said : the great british industrial working classes voted overwhelmingly for brexit .", 
                "i am not at all attracted by the idea of rewarding them by cutting their rights .", 
                "he said the government would have to decide whether or not it wanted to remain part of the european customs union before invoking article 50 , starting the formal eu withdrawal process .", 
                "( see 5.20pm . )", 
                "he refused to say whether the uk would remain part of europol .", 
                "labour 's yvette cooper asked this .", 
                "davis said the government wanted to preserve the relationship with the eu on security matters as best we can .", 
                "he went on : of course we are aiming to maintain that .", 
                "and that 's the answer . ''", 
                "but he seemed to be making a general point , not answering the specific question about europol .", 
                "that is how cooper interpreted his answer .", 
                "yvette cooper ( @ yvettecoopermp ) asked if gov had made decision on whether we shd stay in europol ( fundamental for fighting crime & trafficking ) .", 
                "answer came there none he said the government would try to establish a national consensus on brexit .", 
                "as we proceed , we will be guided by some clear principles .", 
                "first , as i said , we wish to build a national consensus around our position .", 
                "second , while always putting the national interest first , we will always act in good faith towards our european partners .", 
                "third , wherever possible we will try to minimise any uncertainty that change can inevitably bring .", 
                "and , fourth , crucially , we will - by the end of this process - have left the european union , and put the sovereignty and supremacy of this parliament beyond doubt .", 
                "that 's all from me for today .", 
                "thanks for the comments ."
