                "nigel farage has told ukip that he intends to remain as party leader for the foreseeable future and the party should use the election as a springboard for even greater success in the election after the one in may .", 
                "speaking on a day which saw new polling illustrate how negative perceptions of the party are getting worse , farage said last night 's poll showing him well ahead in thanet south demonstrated how effective campaigning could make a difference .", 
                "he said that , as well as winning in some seats in may , he hoped ukip would come second in hundreds '' more so that it would establish itself as the real opposition to the party in power .", 
                "it would be the real opposition to labour in the north , he said .", 
                "and he suggested he had no plans to step down as leader anytime soon .", 
                "what matters is that we succeed on may 7 and that we get a good number of ukip mps over the line and that in hundreds of constituencies in this country we have the opportunity to build ourselves from second position in those seats as the real oppostion .", 
                "and i certainly think that in the north of england this election will see ukip emerge as the opposition to the labour party virtually anywhere from birmingham to hadrian 's wall .", 
                "i can tell you i am optimistic , i am upbeat , i am bullish , we are going to exceed all expectations , we are going to win lots of seats in this general election and i hope very much to be leading this party , not just into this general election , but into all the elections to come .", 
                "in years to come we have elections in wales and scotland and northern ireland and london and we are genuinely now the only truly national party in british politics .", 
                "he said the recovery was based on debt financing '' and that ukip would be the only party talking honestly about this at the election .", 
                "they [ the coalition ] have doubled the national debt and i think we 're the only party that will talk honestly about that in this general election .", 
                "he criticised the conservatives and labour for engaging in us-style negative campaigning .", 
                "what you have seen since january 2 is the beginning , not just of the longest election campaign in history , but the most negative election campaign in history .", 
                "i 'm not a supporter of ed miliband in any way at all , but it seems to me that the personal attacks that have been lumped on him , and in turn back on cameron , and of course everybody attacking me - but then i 'm used to that - it seems to me that this is not the kind of politics that this country wants or needs .", 
                "what the people want are some politics of hope , some politics of inspiration .", 
                "he claimed that his opponents were spreading unfounded and malicious rumours about him being ill .", 
                "he said he had kept a low profile in recent weeks because he had been campaining hard in thanet south , where a poll now shows him well ahead .", 
                "ukip hoped not just to win the seat , but to take control of the council , he said .", 
                "patrick o'flynn , ukip 's economic spokesman , said that ukip was having so much influence on government policy it was effectively in power '' .", 
                "norman lamont once said the tories in office gave the impression of being in office but not in power .", 
                "well , under david cameron 's premiership sometimes it feels like ukip is in power but not in office .", 
                "that 's all from me for today .", 
                "thanks for the comments ."
