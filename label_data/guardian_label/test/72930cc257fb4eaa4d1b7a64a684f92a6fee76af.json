                "the cfmeu and its delegate , andrew harisiou were penalised $ 90,000 and $ 8,000 respectively for breaches of laws relating to coercion , at the pacific werribee shopping centre site in 2015 .", 
                "the court found that the cfmeu prevented workers from working on the construction site unless they joined the cfmeu and immediately paid the required membership fees .", 
                "in handing down his decision , justice tracey made the following remarks ; having regard to the history of offending by the cfmeu to which i have referred , it may be doubted that any penalty falling within the available range for contraventions of the kind presently under consideration would be sufficiently high to deter repetition .", 
                "any penalty will be paid and treated as a necessary cost of enforcing the cfmeu 's demand that all workers on certain classes of construction sites be union members .", 
                "justice tracey is the second judge in two weeks to express concern that penalties that can be imposed by the courts are too small to act as a deterrent in light of the cfmeu 's ongoing policy of deliberate law-breaking .", 
                "last week , justice vasta of the federal court remarked that ; there has been no remorse from the cfmeu .", 
                "there has been no evidence of the cfmeu training any of its officers as to the provisions of the fw act to ensure that such abominable behaviour is not undertaken by any of its representatives ever again .", 
                "as i have noted , the approach of the cfmeu has been that the imposition of pecuniary penalties are nothing more than an occupational hazard .", 
                "this court has been asked to ensure that the industrial relations regime as created by parliament is observed and complied with .", 
                "the parliament has given the court only one weapon to ensure such compliance , and that is the ability to impose pecuniary penalties .", 
                "in the main , this weapon has been of great value .", 
                "if a court has dealt with an employer who has contravened the fw act in an appropriate manner , the use of the pecuniary penalty has deterred that employer from breaching the fw act again .", 
                "very rarely has the fwo , or a union , had to bring a recalcitrant employer back to the court for breaching the fw act a second time .",

                "the deterrent aspect of the pecuniary penalty system is not having the desired effect .", 
                "the cfmeu has not changed its attitude in any meaningful way .", 
                "the court can only impose the maximum penalty in an attempt to fulfil its duty and deter the cfmeu from acting in the nefarious way in which it does .",
