                "i think lots of people who understand the context would appreciated why that might have happened .", 
                "but that does n't make it any more acceptable .", 
                "and i think what this shows is that in our democracy we hold cabinet ministers to the very highest standards of conduct , rightly .", 
                "but i think we should remember that those are standards that would probably not apply in many other countries .", 
                "and those standards apply even to cabinet ministers who are the most senior , as he was .", 
                "hunt expressed concerns about the behaviour of the police in this episode .", 
                "he said : i think if you look at what happened , some of the actions , particularly of a retired police officer , do n't sit comfortably in a democracy , and theresa may made very clear in her letter that she was very uncomfortable with what had happened and that she was pleased that cressida dick , the metropolitan police commissioner , also felt that which is why an investigation is happening .", 
                "he praised may as someone of the most extraordinary resilience in very , very challenging circumstances .", 
                "he expressed regret about green 's departure , describing him as an outstanding public servant who did an extraordinary job in the various ministerial posts that he did.radio 4 today ( @ bbcr4today ) health secretary @ twitterid hunt says damian green was sacked because he `` lied '' but calls it a `` sad moment '' # r4today tim shipman , the sunday times 's political editor , thinks hunt did his own career prospects no harm at all with his interview .",
