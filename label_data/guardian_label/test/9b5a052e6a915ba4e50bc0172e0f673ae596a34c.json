                "i do n't think we can be certain , but let 's see what all the reviews say , but i really do n't think we can be certain that an armed officer would necessarily have been able to protect themselves or to intervene earlier what i would say is that it appears to me that in this particularly scenario is is very hard to say that if keith had been armed he would be alive today .",
