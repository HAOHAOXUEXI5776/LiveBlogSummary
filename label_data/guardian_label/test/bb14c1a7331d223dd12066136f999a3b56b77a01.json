                "and andrew neil went over the same ground more aggressively with david laws .", 
                "laws outlined various tax increased proposed by the lib dems ; when neil said there these only accounted for a small amount of the money that needed to be found , laws said that labour and the tories were even worse at saying how they would eliminate the deficit .", 
                "but there is an obvious answer .", 
                "and steve webb , the pensions minister , may have just revealed it in his speech .", 
                "he was not announcing policy , but he gave a clear hint where the lib dems ( or labour perhaps ) may try to raise billions in extra revenue .",

                "yesterday the lib dems announced plans to save \u00a3 500m by reducing the lifetime pension tax relief limit from \u00a3 1.25m to \u00a3 1m , but webb suggested the lib dems could go much further .", 
                "we also need to tackle the inequity - or should i say iniquity - of the current system of tax relief on pensions .", 
                "if i want to put \u00a3 1 into my pension it only costs me 60p - the taxpayer contributes the other 40p through higher rate tax relief .", 
                "but if someone on an average wage wants to put \u00a3 1 into their pension it costs then 80p - the taxpayer only contributes 20p .", 
                "that can not be right .", 
                "we spend something like \u00a3 37 billion a year on tax relief for pensions and yet overwhelmingly the money goes to those who are already well off and who will end up with decent pensions in any case .", 
                "we could probably spend less on pension tax relief overall - helping to contribute to deficit reduction - but also rebalance the money so that everyone , rich or poor , got help at the same rate .", 
                "we need to work through the details , but in my view the next government will need to address this longstanding unfairness .", 
                "he floated the idea of getting workers to automatically increase their pension contributions when the get a pay rise .", 
                "having got millions of people in to workplace saving we need to get them saving more than the bare statutory minimum of 8 % .", 
                "i am quite attracted to the idea that when you start a job the norm is that each time you get a pay rise a part of the extra cash goes into your pension , building up gradually to a worthwhile sum .", 
                "you could opt out of this 'automatic escalation ' but unless you actively chose to opt out , you would gradually contribute more .", 
                "he floated the idea of having a single assessment process for disabled people .", 
                "we should be looking to see whether the needs of disabled people could be assessed in one go for their different disability benefits and social care needs , rather than having constant assessments and reassessments for different benefits and separately again by local authorities .",
