                "a large part of our agenda is about reform that will be good for all 28 countries of the eu ; making it more competitive ; making it more outward-looking ; making it more focused on how to hold our own in a global economy ; making sure that the whole of the european union can create the jobs , the economic growth , the prosperity that we need .",
