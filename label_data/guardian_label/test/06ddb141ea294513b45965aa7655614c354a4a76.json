                "it looks like another day dominated by talk about the global economy , and central banks ' ability to improve the situation and ward off a crash .", 
                "but mario draghi , the head of the european central bank , has given world leaders a clear message - do n't rely on us for everything .", 
                "speaking to reporters in brussels last night during an eu summit on the refugee crisis , draghi revealed he had told politician to do their bit and reform their economies .", 
                "the ecb chief said : i made clear that even though monetary policy has been really the only policy driving the recovery in the last few years , it can not address some basic structural weaknesses of the eurozone economy .", 
                "for that you need structural reforms , mostly driven to raise the level of demand , public investments and lower taxes .", 
                "even more importantly , one needs clarity on the future of our monetary union .", 
                "draghi is notorious for avoiding reporters on these occasions ; he 's got a great ability to move like a cat through the press who doorstep these summits .", 
                "so when he stops to talk , he really wants his message out there .", 
                "and perhaps he 's worried that the new stimulus package announced by the ecb last week is going to encourage eu leaders to take their eye off the ball .", 
                "draghi speaking with greek pm alexis tsipras last night .", 
                "hoslet/epa also coming up today uk supermarket chain sainsbury , and south africa 's steinhoff international , both have until 5pm gmt to launch a new takeover bid for argos , the british catalogue retailer : sainsbury 's set to raise bid as argos takeover deadline approaches read more theres not much in the economic calendar , but we do get the latest count of us oil rigs this afternoon .",
