                "it could cause the government to rethink its hard brexit agenda '' , he said .", 
                "that is probably an exaggeration , although the byelection may well have some implications for brexit .", 
                "here are 10 lessons from the richmond park byelection .", 
                "1 - voters in richmond park were making a protest about brexit - but they were not necessarily voting against theresa may 's brexit .", 
                "zac goldsmith triggered the byelection so that he could stand as an independent and register his opposition to a heathrow third runway , but the lib dems neutralised that by saying they would oppose the heathrow third runway just as strongly .", 
                "instead they invited voters to use the byelection to vote against hard '' brexit and in favour of a second referendum .", 
                "but lib dems who campaigned in the seat admit that many people were supporting them not specifically because they are opposed to what may and david davis are doing but because they wanted to vote against the entire 23 june referendum result .", 
                "in other words , it may well have been more of a vote against vote leave than a vote against the conservative government .", 
                "2 - the government 's working majority is now down to 13 .", 
                "assuming that zac goldsmith would have voted with the government on everything apart from heathrow , that 's a reduction from 15 .", 
                "that does not help , but it is not in itself too disastrous for may .", 
                "3 - byelection losses can put pressure on governments to change policy - but there are two good reasons why there is is little chance of that happening here .", 
                "leaders fear losing seats in byelections not so much because their majority goes down but because , if all their mps start getting scared that they too will lose their seats because of the poll tax or abolishing the 10p rate of income tax or whatever , the parliamentary party becomes unmanageable .", 
                "but may is unlikely to face a delegation of mps coming to see her to tell her that she must change course over brexit .", 
                "why ?", 
                "first , this may well have been more of an anti brexit vote than an anti hard '' brexit vote .", 
                "and , second , richmond park is one of the most pro-remain seats in the country .", 
                "it is estimated that 72 % of people there voted remain ( compared to the national figure of 48 % ) .",

                "this hanretty chart ( pdf ) shows only seven english seats with higher remain votes .", 
                "whatever , there are very few tory mp who will worry about a remain backlash as strong as the one in richmond park .", 
                "update : hanretty has a better chart here , showing richmond park as the 28th most pro-remain constituency in the country .", 
                "chris hanretty ( @ chrishanretty ) # richmondpark is the 28th most pro-remain constituency in the uk , according to my estimates 4 - but this result will embolden lib dem mps and peers , because they can now claim to have a mandate to oppose a hard '' brexit and to push for a second referendum .", 
                "sarah olney 's election takes the number of lib dem mps in the commons from eight to nine and the tory jacob rees-mogg was right to dismiss them as a relatively puny commons force .",

                "one byelection win by itself will not revive the party , which is still doing dreadfully in national polls .",

                "labour fielded a strong candidate , christian wolmar , but his vote collapsed .", 
                "tactical voting seems the obvious explanation , which is why the result does not really tell us anything about labour and jeremy corbyn ( despite tim farron 's attempts to claim otherwise - see 7.47am . )",

                "labour 's decision not to adopt this approach was controversial .",

                "some commentators claim that traditional political parties are dying , and that the future belongs to insurgent outsiders like donald trump .",

                "goldsmith 's supporters believe that one of the main reasons he lost was that , once he decided to stand as an independent , he lost access to the activist support and voter id data that are essential components of victory in a contest like this .",
