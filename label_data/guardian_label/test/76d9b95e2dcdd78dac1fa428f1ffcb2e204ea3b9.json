                "he told the pm programme : clearly most people would be revolted at the idea of british nationals who have been over to syria or iraq to fight coming back to this country , but if they are british nationals , and the queen 's subjects , there is nothing to prevent them doing so .", 
                "they may well have committed serious criminal offences ; they should be arrested at the airport and put on trial .",

                "the government has made clear it does n't want to deprive these individuals of citizenship .", 
                "it ca n't do so , because they would be stateless , and we have got to adhere to our international legal obligations .",

                "that explains the curiously understated nature of today 's statement .", 
                "on the substance , it was part u-turn ( on tpims ) and part back-of-the-envelope kite-flying ( on passports , where it seems the government has very little idea of it wants to do ) .", 
                "for aficianados of muscular government , it will have looked a bit feeble , and cameron will probably get soundly ridiculed in some quarters when the first editions of tomorrow 's newspapers arrive .",

                "partly , i guess , that 's because most mps realised that these issues are complicated and that 12-point plans play better in the press than in the court .", 
                "but it also had something to do with the tone he adopted .", 
                "at no point did he say anything remotely partisan and , time and time again , he made an attempt to find common ground with mps taking a critical stance .", 
                "look , for example , at what he said to dominic grieve at 4.06pm or frank dobson at 4.23pm or sir edward garnier at 4.31pm .",

                "he told mps : the intelligence agencies and police believe they need stronger powers to impose further restrictions and the independent reviewer of counter-terror legislation , david anderson , agrees .", 
                "we will introduce new powers to add to our existing tpims , including stronger locational constraints on suspects under tpims , either through enhanced use of exclusion zones or through relocation powers .",

                "that 's why we should take the tpims as the basis and amend them as necessary .", 
                "cameron said he would give the authorities the power to ban terror suspects from returning to the uk , but that the details had not been worked out yet .", 
                "he told mps : we are clear in principle that what we need is a targeted , discretionary power to allow us to exclude british nationals from the uk and we will work up proposals on this basis with our agencies , in line with our international obligations , and discuss the details on a cross-party basis .", 
                "he said he would give police officers the power to remove passports from suspected jihadists trying to leave the country without having to get the home secretary 's approval .", 
                "he said : passports are not an automatic right .", 
                "the home secretary already has the discretion to issue , revoke and refuse passports under the royal prerogative if there is reason to believe people are planning to take part in terrorist-related activity .", 
                "but when police suspect a traveller at the border , they are not currently able to apply for the royal prerogative and so only have limited stop-and-search powers .", 
                "we will introduce specific and targeted legislation to fill this gap by providing the police with a temporary power to seize a passport at the border , during which time they will be able to investigate the individual concerned .", 
                "this power will include appropriate safeguards and oversight arrangements .", 
                "he also said the government would prepare legislation so that , if these prerogative powers are challenged in the courts , the government can continue to remove passports with the authority of primary legislation .", 
                "he said that criminalising travel to certain countries , an idea floated by boris johnson , would be wrong .", 
                "cameron said airlines would be blocked from landing in the uk if they did not comply with tougher rules about providing passenger information .",

                "he said : what is important is that we also fill in some of the gaps that have been left so far - so for instance on financial sanctions we need to make sure that we press home on things like syndicated loans which others have opposed but we have been prepared to support .",
