            "text": [
                "david cameron may well have received a thorough kicking from the rightwing press this morning , but when it came to facing his mps in the house of commons this afternoon , he had a remarkably easy ride .", 
                "true , the vocal out brigade were out in force to criticise the draft renegotiation deal .", 
                "but what was significant was quite how restrained they all were .", 
                "about the only person to express any genuine disdain was jacob rees-mogg .", 
                "( see 1.54pm . )", 
                "is a tribute to the innate politeness of conservative backbenchers ?", 
                "maybe they are a polite lot , but actually something much more significant has happened : the great tory euro split , the one that was supposed to be on a par with the repeal of the corn laws , has been called off .", 
                "that is not to say the party is united .", 
                "dozens of tory mps will vote to leave the eu , and at some point the debate may get bitter and unpleasant .", 
                "if the conservative party were in the midst of an existential crisis , and about to tear itself apart on this great issue of principle , then at this point - with cameron 's renegotiation virtually over - the fissure would open up in the house of commons .", 
                "the out bandwagon would be rolling , and passions would not running high .", 
                "but it is n't , and they 're not .", 
                "if anything , momentum is with the in side .", 
                "( look at what theresa may said last night . )", 
                "not only is there no need to dig out the robert peel biographies ; this does n't even seem to compare with maastricht .", 
                "there may be an entire dissertation to be written about why the great tory euro split has fizzled out but here is a quick summary of some of the people/factors who can take the credit/blame .", 
                "mark reckless , ukip , and nigel farage - because if reckless had kept his seat at the election , or ukip had done better , then defecting to an anti-eu party might be a realistic career option for conservative mps .", 
                "now it is n't .", 
                "first past the post - because , if fptp went , a rightwing , anti-eu party would become electorally viable .", 
                "ed miliband and labour - because if labour were in government , and holding a referendum , tory mps would probably find backing the no campaign much more appealing .", 
                "so miliband contributed by losing the election , although if he had one , he was not planning a referendum , and so he could have contributed in that regard too .", 
                "david cameron - because he seems to be doing a reasonably good job of containing his ministerial eu rebels .", 
                "( it would not be hard to imagine a gang of anti-eu ministers putting out a joint statement today denouncing the deal , and challenging cameron to sack them .", 
                "but that has not happened , and the key floating voters - theresa may and boris johnson - seem to be leaning in . )", 
                "of these four factors , fptp is probably the most important .", 
                "anyway , back to cameron .", 
                "here are the main points from his session .", 
                "cameron suggested that he will introduce further measures to assert the sovereignty of the uk parliament if he successfully concludes a deal on the terms of britain 's eu membership .", 
                "as nicholas watt and rowena mason report , cameron said he would move to put beyond doubt '' the sovereignty of parliament when he was challenged on his negotiations by boris johnson .", 
                "the exchanges between cameron and the london mayor will fuel speculation that johnson will make a late entry into the campaign to keep the uk in a reformed eu .", 
                "cameron rejected calls to rule out an eu referendum in june , effectively confirming reports that thursday 23 june is his preferred date .", 
                "angus robertson , the snp leader at westminster , raised the issue at pmqs and the it came up again repeatedly during the statement .", 
                "robertson said the first ministers of scotland , wales and northern ireland had written to cameron saying holding the referendum in june would mean the campaign overlapped with the elections to the devolved bodies .", 
                "in their letter the first ministers , nicola sturgeon , carwyn jones and arlene foster , said : we believe that holding a referendum as early as june will mean that a significant part of the referendum campaign will necessarily run in parallel with those elections and risks confusing issues at a moment when clarity is required .", 
                "furthermore , it will be virtually impossible for the political parties in our respective territories to plan effectively for , and where appropriate work together on , the referendum campaign while our own elections are in progress .", 
                "cameron said : i respect the electorates of england , scotland , wales and northern ireland on the basis that i think people are perfectly capable of making up their minds in a local election or in a scottish parliamentary election , or in a welsh assembly election and then , a period of some weeks afterwards , making up their mind all over again on the vital question of the european union .", 
                "he also said that alex salmond , the former scottish first minister , originally called for a six week gap between the may elections and the eu referendum .", 
                "cameron said he would not hold the referendum within six weeks of the may elections .", 
                "thursday 23 june comes seven weeks after the may poll .", 
                "cameron also said that voters in scotland , wales and northern ireland were in favour of a referendum .", 
                "cameron said that the emergency brake '' mechanism could be introduced within months .", 
                "asked about claims that it could take up to 18 months for the uk to get the power to apply the emergency brake '' cutting benefits for eu migrants , he accepted that the european parliament would have to pass legislation .", 
                "but he said that the parliament was a party to the deal , and that he had discussed this with the leader of the epp group , the biggest in the parliament .", 
                "the law could be fast-tracked through the parliament within three months , he said .", 
                "he said britain was extending its different sort of membership of the eu '' under the proposals in the draft renegotiation plan .", 
                "we are well on our way to saying that our different sort of membership of the eu is not only safeguarded , but is being extended because not only are we out of the euro , out of schengen , but we are also out of every closer union too .", 
                "he said ministers who campaigned to leave the eu once the deal was finalised would not have their careers jeopardised or threatened '' .", 
                "he was responding to a question from the tory michael fabricant who asked for this assurances .", 
                "cameron said the eu renegotiation required more work .", 
                "i believe we are making real progress in all four areas but the process is far from over .", 
                "there are details that still need to be pinned down and intense negotiations to try and agree the deal with 27 other countries .", 
                "he urged conservative mps to ignore the views of their local parties and decide for themselves how to vote in the eu referendum .", 
                "he said : if you passionately believe in your heart that britain is better off outside the eu , then you should vote that way .", 
                "if you think , even if it 's on balance , i think britain 's better off in , go with what you think .", 
                "do n't take a view because of what your constituency association might say , or you 're worried about a boundary review , or you think it might be advantageous this way or that way .", 
                "do what 's in your heart , if you think it 's right for britain then do that .", 
                "jeremy corbyn , the labour leader , dismissed the renegotiation as a tory party drama '' .", 
                "he told cameron : in truth , your negotiation in reality is a tory party drama that 's being played out in front of us as we see at the moment .", 
                "for all the sound and fury you have ended up exactly where you knew you would be - making the case to remain in europe , which is what you always intended despite the renegotiating spectacle choreographed for tv cameras over the whole continent .", 
                "that 's all from me for today .",
