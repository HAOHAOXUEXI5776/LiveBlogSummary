                "this failure has been most acutely felt in london , which is building less than half of the homes in needs to sustain its growing population .",

                "he says the party is not paying enough attention to why it lost in scotland .", 
                "of these two outcomes , easily the more catastrophic as far as labour is concerned was the one in scotland - yet it also appears to be the one that is at risk of being ignored .", 
                "because the results north of the border mean that the parliamentary labour party is all but denuded of scottish voices , the initial manoeuvres in the party leadership contest are being played out exclusively among mps from england and wales , many of who are relatively unfamiliar with the party 's difficulties north of the border .", 
                "he says tony blair 's claim that the main problem was that labour abandoned the centre ground was too simplistic .", 
                "data from the british election study shows that those who voted labour in 2010 but subsequently switched their support to the snp after the referendum were both disproportionately in favour of a more equal society and more likely to regard the snp as the party that shared that view .", 
                "no less than 74 per cent of these lost voters supported the redistribution of income ( compared with 59 per cent of scots generally ) , and although 48 per cent of them thought that labour backed that position , 75 per cent reckoned that the snp did .", 
                "this evidence must caution against any idea that the solution to labour 's problems is simply for the party to reclaim the centre ground of british politics that was supposedly vacated during ed miliband 's tenure as leader .", 
                "the complaint about the party north of the border has been that its voice has not been sufficiently radical , or at least distinctive - an impression that fighting a referendum campaign in alliance with the conservatives certainly did nothing to dispel .", 
                "he says labour did not lose ground amongst middle class voters .", 
                "the level of support for labour in each class was much the same as it had been five years previously .", 
                "there is , in truth , no strong evidence here of labour particularly losing touch with its more middle class supporters .", 
                "rather , what is notable about the party 's performance is that what had been an especially marked drop in its support among c2 and de supporters between 2005 and 2010 was not reversed this time around .", 
                "perhaps not least of the reasons for this - and for the conservatives ' own loss of support among working class voters - is the fact that support for ukip among c2 and de voters was at 19 per cent and 17 per cent respectively , markedly higher than among ab ( 8 per cent ) and c1 voters ( 11 per cent ) .", 
                "and he says that competence is crucial - but that this is not the same as taking a conservative approach .", 
                "there can be little doubt that one of labour 's key failures in the last five years was its inability to restore its reputation for economic competence .", 
                "on that , all wings of the party can probably agree .", 
                "but restoring that reputation need not necessarily be synonymous with embracing a conservative approach to handling the nation 's finances or the economy more generally .", 
                "what labour has to ask itself is not only why it failed to attract the support of voters who were concerned about the deficit , but also why it often struggled to secure the support of those who were doubtful about the way in which the deficit and the economy were being handled in the first place .", 
                "many of the latter were working-class voters among whom labour suffered a sharp loss of support in 2010 which they failed to reverse in 2015 .", 
                "labour needs to convince the electorate not only that it can run the economy well , but that it is capable of creating a more attractive economy .", 
                "then , perhaps , voters not just in england and wales but in scotland too would be willing to look at the party afresh once more .",
