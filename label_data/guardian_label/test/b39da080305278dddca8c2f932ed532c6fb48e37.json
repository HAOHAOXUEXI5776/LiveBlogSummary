                "the 78-page investigation by the inspector general of the state department singled out several previously unknown breaches by clinton while she was secretary of state , including the use of mobile devices to conduct official business without checking whether they posed a security risk .", 
                "although the report is potentially less damaging than a separate investigation by the fbi into whether she broke federal laws , it poses a significant challenge to the clinton campaign , which has recently slipped behind donald trump in opinion polling .",

                "in a speech at the center for popular democracy 's annual gala last night , massachusetts senator elizabeth warren opened up with both barrels on donald trump , calling him a money-grubber who rooted for families to get thrown out of their homes in the housing market crash , a tool of the wall street banks and a tax delinquent .",
