                "lord nash , a conservative education minister , has told peers that the feeding britain report shows how poor people need to learn to prioritise their spending more effectively .",

                "it did go up 10 times under the previous government .", 
                "the oecd tell us that the use of food banks in this country is in fact well below the national averages .", 
                "the key way to reduce dependence on food banks is through education so people are less likely to be [ out of ] work and they are able to prioritise their funding better and making work pay through our reforms to the benefits system .", 
                "iain duncan smith , the work and pensions secretary , has announced modest measures to reduce the chances of benefit claimants not having enough money to eat .", 
                "speaking in the commons , he said that he was launching a publicity campaign to make claimants more aware of the availability of short-term benefit advances , and that he was issuing guidance to job centre staff telling them to ensure that claimants at risk of hardship know about the availability of emergency payments .", 
                "he said he was taking the feeding britain report very seriously '' .", 
                "frank field , who co-chaired the inquiry that produced the report , welcomed the move .", 
                "he said : the secretary of state has made some enormously welcome first moves this afternoon .", 
                "even the most efficient benefits system will have some delays , and it is vital both that emergency payments are made available and that they are actively publicised to prevent the need for using a food bank .", 
                "might the government now take further action to limit the amount of time it takes to process a claim ?", 
                "george osborne , the chancellor , has signalled that public sector workers face real-terms pay cuts for another four years under his plans .",

                "we have to have a government we can afford as a country .", 
                "he also defended the conservatives ' right to attack their lib dem coalition partners over the economy .", 
                "he said : there 's a perfectly legitimate difference between the conservative party which says we have a sensible , realistic and competent plan to reduce the deficit and maintain the economic stability we 've won in this country , by a mix of public expenditure , savings , welfare and tax , and all the alternatives .", 
                "and it 's not just liberal democrats , it 's labour , ukip , you can put them all into the same mix .",
