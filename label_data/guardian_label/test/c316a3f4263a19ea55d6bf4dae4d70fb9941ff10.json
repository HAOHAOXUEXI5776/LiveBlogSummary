                "here 's some reaction to the slowdown in britain 's construction sector last month : mike chappell , global corporates managing director for construction at lloyds bank commercial banking : the uncertainty created by the forthcoming uk negotiations to leave the eu appears to be causing less disruption than might have been expected , with the reading still above 50 .", 
                "the sector enjoyed a buoyant finish to last year and this data , although lower than december 's index , still suggests an encouraging start to 2017 .", 
                "most contractors are taking a pragmatic view of the current uncertainty : leaving the single market is still some way off and the uk-centric construction industry is less exposed to the eu than other sectors .", 
                "nevertheless , they are focussing their attentions on how to manage higher costs and looming financial challenges , such as potential interest rate rises and increasing inflation , through hedging arrangements .", 
                "in other times the cost challenges presented by the weaker pound and anticipated headwinds might be a recipe for a shake-out of the sector , but so far there is little to indicate a wave of consolidation is imminent .", 
                "paul trigg , construction specialist and assistant head of risk underwriting at euler hermes , the world 's largest credit insurer : with cities outside of london reporting record activity levels and contractors enjoying the security of a strong pipeline of work for the months ahead , the sector 's short-to-mid-term outlook is healthy .", 
                "but , the current positivity may be built on weak foundations .", 
                "a break with the eu will curtail investment in commercial construction projects and explains why the sector 's longer-term pipeline is much thinner .", 
                "total uk corporate failures may also increase - our forecast predicts a five per cent rise this year , six per cent in 2018 and 15 per cent in 2019 without a free trade agreement .", 
                "as the current bounty of work begins to fade without forward orders to replace it , we expect overdue payment issues to increase this year .",
