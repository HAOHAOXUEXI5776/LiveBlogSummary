                "the chief medical officer [ dame sally davies ] , who takes advice from public health england and the scientific advisory group for emergencies , has this morning confirmed that it is likely we will see a case of ebola in the uk , and this could be a handful of cases over the next three months .", 
                "he said the risk to the uk was low '' .", 
                "but the government was still taking additional protective measures , he said .", 
                "[ davies ] confirms that the public health risk in the uk remains low and measures currently in place - including exit screening in all three affected countries - offer the correct level of protection .", 
                "however whilst the response to global health emergencies should always be proportionate , she also advises the government to make preparations for a possible increase in the risk level .", 
                "he said screening of passengers coming to the uk from liberia , sierra leone and guinea , including temperature testing , would start tomorrow .", 
                "rapid access to healthcare services by anyone who may be infected with ebola is important , not only for their own health but also to reduce the risk of transmission to others .", 
                "whilst there are no direct flights from the affected region , there are indirect routes into the uk .", 
                "so in the next week , public health england will start screening and monitoring uk-bound air passengers , identified by the border force , coming on to the main routes from liberia , sierra leone and guinea .", 
                "this will allow potential cases arriving in the uk to be identified , tracked and given rapid access to expert health advice if they need it .", 
                "these measures will start tomorrow at heathrow , which receives around 85 % of all such arrivals across the airport , beginning with terminal 1 .", 
                "they will be expanded by the end of next week to arrivals into gatwick and on the eurostar which connects to paris and brussels-bound arrivals .", 
                "passengers will have their temperature taken and complete a questionnaire asking about their current health , recent travel history and whether they might be at potential risk through contact with ebola patients .", 
                "they will also be required to provide contact details .", 
                "if neither the questionnaire nor the temperature reading raises any concerns , passengers will be told how to make contact with the nhs should they develop ebola symptoms within the 21 day incubation period , and allowed to continue on their journey .", 
                "it is important to stress that a person with ebola is only infectious if they are displaying symptoms .", 
                "any passenger who reports recent exposure to people who may have ebola , or symptoms , or who has a raised temperature will undergo a clinical assessment and , if necessary , will be transferred to hospital .", 
                "he said these screening measures would not reach 100 % of people coming to the uk from the affected areas .", 
                "to reach these people , posters will be on display at ports and airports advising people to get themselves checked .", 
                "we expect these measures to reach 89 % of travellers we know have come to the uk from the affected region on tickets directly booked for the uk .", 
                "but it is important to note that no screening or monitoring procedure will be able to identify 100 % of the people arriving from ebola-affected countries , not least because not all passengers leaving the countries will immediately take connecting routes to the uk .", 
                "so today i can announce that the government will ensure , working with the devolved administrations , that there is highly visible information displayed at all entry points to the uk asking passengers to identify themselves in their own best interests if they have travelled to the affection regions in the last 21 days .", 
                "this information for travellers will be available by the end of this week .", 
                "he said nhs 111 call handlers were being asked to ask callers with respiratory symptoms about their travel history , and that alerts were going out to doctors .", 
                "he said there 26 ebola beds available in the uk .", 
                "if [ people ] test positive for ebola they will then be transferred to the royal free hospital in north london , which is the uk specialist centre for treating the most dangerous infectious diseases .", 
                "we also have plans in place to surge ebola bed capacity in newcastle , liverpool and sheffield , making a total of 26 beds available in the uk .", 
                "we will always follow medical advice as to whether any measures we adopt are likely to be effective and are a proportionate response to risk .", 
                "however , i do believe that we are amongst the best and most-prepared countries in the world .", 
                "he said the government had co-funded trials of a possible ebola vaccine .", 
                "he said there have been been 4,033 confirmed deaths and 8399 confirmed , probable and suspected cases of ebola recorded in seven countries , although widespread transmission is confined to liberia , sierra leone and guinea . ''", 
                "cases are doubling every three to four weeks , he said .", 
                "he said the uk was the second biggest donor to the international effort to tackle the ebola crisis in west africa .", 
                "with the world health organisation , we are training more than 120 health workers a week , and piloting a new community approach to ebola care to reduce , and hopefully stop , the transmission rate .", 
                "we are also building and providing laboratory services , and supporting an information campaign in-country .", 
                "we are now deploying the royal navy 's rfa argus and its merlin helicopters along with highly-skilled military personnel bringing our military deployment to 750 .", 
                "they will support the construction of the kerrytown ebola treatment centre and other facilities , provide logistics and planning support , and help establish and staff a world health organisation-led ebola training facility to increase training to health workers .",
