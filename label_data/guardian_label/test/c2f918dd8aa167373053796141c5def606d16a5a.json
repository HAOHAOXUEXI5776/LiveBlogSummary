                "questions of momentum and inevitability have been tossed aside in the light of cold , hard math and with delegate-rich state contests in new york , pennsylvania and new jersey on the horizon , today may have been a dress rehearsal for delegate battles that will require a ti-83 calculator to sort out .", 
                "before you break down into fits of long division , however , here are the key takeaways from the campaign trail on this cold , windy saturday in april : vermont senator bernie sanders once again declared victory in a white , rural , western caucus state , this time taking wyoming by a smaller-than-expected margin over former secretary of state hillary clinton .", 
                "early estimates indicated that the 14 delegates up for grabs today would be approximately evenly split , with the remaining six delegates to be pledged at the state democratic convention in may .",
