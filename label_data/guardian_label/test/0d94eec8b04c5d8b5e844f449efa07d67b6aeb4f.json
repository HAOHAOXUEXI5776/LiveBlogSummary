                "the office for national statistics found that clothing prices tumbled by 5.9 % month-on-month in july , as high street shops belatedly got their summer sales under way .",

                "and though the pound has weakened a little of late , it remains much higher than earlier in the year , which is helping to subdue import prices .", 
                "furthermore , today 's data suggest that - if anything - the pressures coming along the supply chain are disinflationary .",

                "this indicates that there may indeed be additional slack in the labour market that needs to be used up in order for pay to keep up with inflation and gives the boe scope to continue to keep rates on hold .", 
                "another factor that 's probably winning the argument against raising rates too soon is that some of the world 's major economies either contracted or saw minimal growth in the last quarter .",

                "the retail price index , the wider measure of inflation , dropped slightly to 2.5 % in july .", 
                "that means that rail fares in england and wales are likely to rise by 3.5 % on average , and up to 5.5 % in some cases , in 2015 .", 
                "the chancellor , though , could yet cap rises at a lower rate the ons also reported that uk house prices hit a new record high in june , although the pace of growth moderated ."
