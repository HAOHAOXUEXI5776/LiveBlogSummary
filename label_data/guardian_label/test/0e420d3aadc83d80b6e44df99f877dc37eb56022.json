                "i know that no one has to let you off the leash , that you are a very strong-minded man anyway , but it 's good to know that mr turnbull , who i have described as labor-lite here , is listening to someone from the right .", 
                "peter dutton : well ray look , all i can tell you is of my experience with malcolm turnbull and on this issue and many others he is rock solid .", 
                "i mean , it 's a disaster in my mind that bill shorten would become prime minister because you know the labor party wrecked our economy last time look at what they 're doing in queensland .", 
                "they 're now raiding superannuation accounts .", 
                "they 're taking money out to put into recurrent expenditure .",

                "i think malcolm turnbull has demonstrated to people that he does have a very firm view in relation to keeping the boats stopped , stopping kids drowning , making sure that people are out of detention .", 
                "so , look , i find myself on the same page with malcolm turnbull in terms of keeping strong borders , i 'm proud of the relationship that we 've got and i think at this election there 's a big difference between what is an old labor model and what has been proven to work , and that 's what we 're presiding over in border protection .", 
                "i find myself on the same page is an odd locution from a minister about a prime minister .",
