                "labour has accused the government of being all over the place '' on domestic security .", 
                "after ed miliband used pmqs to expose policy differences between cameron and nick clegg ( see 1.18pm ) , a labour source said : the prime minister confirmed he wants to go ahead with relocation powers .", 
                "that is very different from what the deputy prime minister said earlier this week .",

                "at pmqs he was asked about this by sir menzies campbell , the former lib dem leader .", 
                "campbell said : you will be aware that often when these cases arise , there 's a suggestion that ransom should be paid .", 
                "should those who advance that case take account of the fact the money achieved by ransom is not distributed , for example , among the impoverished citizens of gaza , rather it is used to purchase weapons , to finance the training and maintenance of those who are willing to use them and otherwise to advance the malevolent objectives of terrorism ?", 
                "cameron said campbell was absolutely 100 % right '' .", 
                "he went on : there 's no doubt in my mind that the many tens of millions of dollars that isil has raised from ransom payments is going into promoting terrorism , including terrorism affecting our own country .", 
                "at the g8 , i launched an initiative to try to get other countries to sign-up to a very clear doctrine that in the case of terrorist kidnap , no ransom should be paid .",

                "speaking on the world at one , cooper said labour 's opposition to air strikes against syria last year did not mean that it would oppose a bombing campaign against isis .",

                "the whole situation is obviously extremely complex .", 
                "last year the concern was that there was n't a clear objective at the time that the prime minister seemed to be rushing to take action without a clear sense of objective or what action we would take that would be workable and would meet those objectives at the time .", 
                "i think , therefore , the government has been right to take a more measured approach this time , to look very carefully at all of the issues .", 
                "and we 've supported the government .", 
                "obviously ministers have said that airstrikes are not on the table at the moment .",

                "it 's not unlike the cold war , where we did not just pursue those who wanted to do us such harm .",

                "it 's time now to toughen up so that nato can deal with the aggression and the threats that we face .", 
                "that means rapid reaction forces that are worthy of the name , that means better sharing of capability , and it means the first ever public commitment to increase defence spending .",

                "may said the police , ambulance and fire services would have to integrate in the future .", 
                "this was because further spending cuts were inevitable , she said .", 
                "what 's striking is that we have been able to make many of these changes not despite spending cuts but because of them .", 
                "this is important , because the need to go on reforming will not end with this parliament .", 
                "with a still-large deficit and a record stock of debt , there will need to be further spending cuts , as even labour acknowledge .", 
                "so in policing in the future , i believe we will need to work towards the integration of the three emergency services .", 
                "she said the home office was going to publish a mobile phone theft index to give consumers more information about which phones are most likely to be stolen .", 
                "police forces tell us that recent rises in theft from the person , for example , were in part driven by the theft of smart phones by organised criminal gangs .", 
                "these gangs targeted specific venues , like concerts and festivals , to steal smart phones on a massive scale .", 
                "the phones were then often sent overseas where they are reactivated and sold .", 
                "there is of course an operational response to this kind of criminal activity , which should be left to the police , but the home office has also been working with industry to find new ways to stop the reactivation of phones overseas , thereby killing the criminals ' export market .", 
                "and we can go further .", 
                "a decade ago , the car theft index contributed to a fall in vehicle theft by allowing consumers to make informed choices about which models of car to buy based on their likelihood of being stolen .", 
                "today i want to announce my intention to do the same with mobile phone theft .", 
                "working with industry and the behavioural insights team at the cabinet office , the home office is developing proposals to further prevent mobile phone theft .", 
                "these include steps that consumers can take to improve personal security , industry innovation to develop new security features she said she wanted to go further '' in terms of opening up senior police jobs to new recruits .", 
                "she said she wanted police forces to use body cameras more often , and to become fully digital '' by 2016 .", 
                "we should go further with direct entry .", 
                "we should use technology she said there were six drivers of crime '' and that she wanted the home office to learn more about them .", 
                "that is why i have set up a team called the crime and policing knowledge hub inside the home office .", 
                "understanding that overall crime levels are only the net result of millions of individual decisions in millions of different contexts , officials have been working to identify and understand the six main drivers of crime in this country .", 
                "we believe they are alcohol , drugs , opportunity , the effectiveness of the criminal justice system , character and profit .", 
                "if we can understand each of these drivers better , if we can understand how they relate to one another , we should be able to devise better policy to prevent crime occurring in the first place .", 
                "she said car thieves are increasingly using technology , not stolen keys , to take cars .", 
                "for example , working with the metropolitan police we have discovered that more than a third of vehicles stolen in london do not involve taking the owner 's keys .", 
                "instead , car thieves might break into a car and programme a new electronic key .", 
                "they might use sophisticated devices to 'grab ' the security coding when the owner uses their key so they can use it themselves .", 
                "and there have been reports that they could even use 'malware ' to commandeer vehicle systems via satellites and issue remote demands to unlock doors , disable alarms and start car engines .", 
                "because we have this understanding , we can now work with industry to improve electronic resilience , include this kind of resilience in the vehicle 's overall security ratings , and work out the extent to which the same threat applies to other physical assets such as building security systems .", 
                "she said one reason she was so keen to tackle domestic violence is because it is not just a crime , but a driver '' of crime too .", 
                "it is well known that children who are brought up in violent households are more likely to become violent themselves later in life , so domestic violence she described labour 's approach to micro-managing crime as complete nonsense '' .", 
                "in march 2002 , he created five policing priority areas '' .", 
                "these places were as small and specific as camberwell green in southwark , the grange estate in stoke , little horton and canterbury in bradford , the west ward in rhyl and stapleton road in bristol .", 
                "the police in these places , labour decided , could n't cope with high levels of crime and anti-social behaviour .", 
                "so the solution was obvious .", 
                "if the police could n't do the job , the home office would .",

                "a civil servant sitting in queen anne 's gate in london was ready to take charge .", 
                "the policing priority areas '' were not an aberration .", 
                "the 2002 police reform act required the home secretary , at the beginning of each financial year , to prepare a national policing plan '' .", 
                "the act said the national policing plan must set out the strategic policing priorities generally for the police areas in england and wales for the period of three years beginning with that year '' .",
