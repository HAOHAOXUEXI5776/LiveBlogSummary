                "good morning everyone and welcome to tuesday on politics live .", 
                "before we power into tuesday , i think it 's worth recapping a notable development of monday , and it 's this : the prime minister had a pretty bad day .", 
                "given it was malcolm turnbull 's first obviously bad day since taking the leadership , i 'll walk you through it .", 
                "monday started with an opinion poll which showed the major parties were locked in a dead heat ( which in the real world should be heavily discounted , given one or two polls does not give you a trend , but in the febrile world of australian politics , a bad poll is a thunderclap in the news cycle .", 
                "echo , echo , echo . )", 
                "the prime minister then unfurled his reforms to senate voting reforms , which , without bipartisan support , will be more difficult to land without mess and contention .", 
                "the cross benchers fired up talk of dirty deals , and labor started hurling around the concept of gerrymanders just to s things up .", 
                "governments tend to approach the politically sensitive subject of political reform on a bipartisan basis for a reason : change happens with very little contention attached to it .", 
                "change has to happen to the senate voting system because the voting system is being gamed there 's no doubt about that but without bipartisanship , the conversation is more risky .", 
                "malcolm turnbull then rolled into question time , and stuffed up .", 
                "he told the parliament in response to a question from labor 's chris bowen : increasing capital gains tax is no part of our thinking whatsoever .", 
                "late yesterday evening that statement was being walked back .", 
                "it became clear the government was , in fact , contemplating measures like halving the capital gains tax discount for superannuation funds .", 
                "so that part of increasing capital gains tax was , in fact , part of the thinking .", 
                "it will be interesting to see how the prime minister handles the reposition after that stumble today .", 
                "the other negative for turnbull in question time i mentioned yesterday .", 
                "labor is keen right now to back the prime minister into a corner where he will define himself as being all for the aspirational rich , the investor class , at the expense of people who are , say , struggling to buy a house .", 
                "turnbull cooperated with that effort yesterday both in tone and in substance .", 
                "i might be quite wrong about this , it would n't be the first time , but i suspect the combination of reflexive partisan negativity and defending the assets of people who can probably cope with one less tax concession is not a good look for him , malcolm turnbull .", 
                "his political style is charm and disarm , not smash and plunder .", 
                "i 'm sure the prime minister is being advised to muscle up to labor , to ramp up the high visibility contrast before powering through quick sticks to the election .", 
                "but the prime minister also needs to consider what 's in his own long term interests as a political leader : the one who promised voters , less aggro , less chaos , less madness , and a genuine conversation about policy when he toppled tony abbott last september .", 
                "abbott got sucked in to serving the machine at his own personal cost .", 
                "it would be good for the collective sanity of politics lovers everywhere if the current prime minister resisted the invitation to repeat past mistakes .", 
                "anyway , let 's power on .", 
                "today thread is open for love readers , hate readers , grammar watchers , spell checkers , encouragers and discouragers .", 
                "welcome everyone .", 
                "magic mikearoo and i are also dancing like we wo n't make it til wednesday on the twitters .", 
                "he 's @ twitterid and i 'm @ twitterid twirl under the disco ball blogans , bloganistas .", 
                "blame it on the boogie .", 
                "here comes tuesday ."
