                "iain duncan smith , the conservative former work and pensions secretary , told the world this weekend that theresa may would probably try to toughen up tpims ( terrorism prevention and investigation measures ) .", 
                "these are the the measures introduced by the coalition to place restrictions on people who are suspected of being terrorists but who have not been convicted of an offence .", 
                "they replaced control orders , introduced by labour , which were tougher , but which were being challenged in the courts .", 
                "duncan smith , who served in the coalition cabinet , said that was one of the things to which may was referring when she spoke about toughening anti-terror laws .", 
                "( see 11.56am . )", 
                "he was asked if that meant internment and he replied : internment always conjures up views of internment of the ira back in the 1970s .", 
                "i do n't think that is what is on the table .", 
                "but i think what is on the table is a much tighter view about the way we got about this tpim stuff .", 
                "one of the things that i was concerned about in coalition i know theresa may was when she was home secretary was during the coalition the tpim order that we brought in , which gives those powers , was watered down .", 
                "and i think it was weakened too much .", 
                "the general sense is , and i think this is the feeling also within the security services , is that , if you think about it , they are watching at least 500 people , every hour of every day .", 
                "and then there are thousands more that they need to watch , but it 's just not feasible so what they need to be able to do is lesson the burden on themselves by , those who they are most concerned about , putting them in a place where they can not do anything .", 
                "that allows them to go wider , to investigate and look further ahead at the others .", 
                "and i think this is really what theresa may is getting to .", 
                "there are several differences between tpims and control orders but a crucial one is that control orders allowed involuntary relocation .", 
                "a suspect living in london could be ordered to go and live somewhere else , where he would be out of touch with his associates .", 
                "duncan smith is implying ( when he talks about suspects being put in a place where they can not do anything ) that may wants to reintroduce this power duncan smith suggests may wants to beef up tpims to allow suspects to be forced to move home .", 
                "this is from a commons library note ( pdf ) explaining the differences between control orders and tpims .", 
                "the measures that may be imposed under [ terrorism prevention and investigation measures act ] are finite , unlike those under the [ prevention of terrorism act ] , and are less intrusive in certain respects .", 
                "involuntary relocation is no longer permitted .", 
                "this was one of the most controversial aspects of the control order regime , and relocation requirements were struck down by the courts in several cases .", 
                "overnight residence requirements which are permitted for tpim subjects must be based somewhere in which the subject has a residence or connection .", 
                "curfews of up to 16 hours are replaced by overnight residence requirements .", 
                "the power to confine persons to a particular area is replaced by a power to exclude them from particular specified areas or places .", 
                "the power to ban all electronic communications is replaced by a provision that requires the subject to be allowed the use of a fixed line and a mobile telephone , and a computer with internet access .", 
                "police searches for the purpose of determining whether there is compliance with tpims now require a warrant from the appropriate judicial authority .", 
                "measures to prohibit and vet visitors and meetings are relaxed ."

                "as terrorism breeds terrorism and perpetrators are inspired to attack , not only on the basis of carefully constructed plots after years of planning and training , and not even as lone attackers radicalised online , but by copying one another and often using the crudest of means of attack .",

                "it is an ideology that is a perversion of islam and a perversion of the truth .", 
                "defeating this ideology is one of the great challenges of our time , but it can not be defeated by military intervention alone .", 
                "it will not be defeated by the maintenance of a permanent defensive counter-terrorism operation , however skillful its leaders and practitioners .", 
                "it will only be defeated when we turn people 's minds away from this violence and make them understand that our values pluralistic british values are superior to anything offered by the preachers and supporters of hate .", 
                "may may have been referring to government plans to reboot the prevent programme later this year .", 
                "she said she was committed to working with other governments to get internet companies to do more to tackle extremism online .", 
                "she said : second , we can not allow this ideology the safe space it needs to breed .", 
                "yet that is precisely what the internet , and the big companies that provide internet-based services provide .", 
                "we need to work with allied democratic governments to reach international agreements that regulate cyberspace to prevent the spread of extremist and terrorism planning .",

                "rudd floated this idea after the westminster attack , although campaigners and internet companies say her demands are unrealistic and disproportionate .", 
                "may said there was far too much tolerance of extremism in our country and that she wanted to stamp it out .",

                "yes , that means taking military action to destroy isis in iraq and syria .", 
                "but it also means taking action here at home .", 
                "while we have made significant progress in recent years , there is to be frank far too much tolerance of extremism in our country .", 
                "so we need to become far more robust in identifying it and stamping it out across the public sector and across society .", 
                "that will require some difficult , and often embarrassing , conversations .", 
                "but the whole of our country needs to come together to take on this extremism , and we need to live our lives not in a series of separated , segregated communities , but as one truly united kingdom .", 
                "this suggests that may is determined to revive plans for a counter-extremism bill .", 
                "after the 2015 general election , david cameron 's government proposed a counter-extremism bill in two successive queen 's speeches but the law never materialised , reportedly because government lawyers could not come up with a definition of non-violent extremism , which the bill was supposed to target .", 
                "the conservative manifesto includes plans to address extremism .", 
                "it says : to defeat extremism , we need to learn from how civil society and the state took on racism in the twentieth century .", 
                "we will consider what new criminal offences might need to be created , and what new aggravated offences might need to be established , to defeat the extremists .", 
                "we will support the public sector and civil society in identifying extremists , countering their messages and promoting pluralistic , british values .", 
                "and we will establish a commission for countering extremism to identify examples of extremism and expose them , to support the public sector and civil society , and help the government to identify policies to defeat extremism and promote pluralistic values .", 
                "but the tories have not said what these new criminal offences might be , or what exposing extremism might mean .", 
                "may 's language this morning is much blunter and more aggressive .", 
                "she proposed a review of counter-terror laws and floated the prospect of toughening sentences , including for apparently less serious terror offences .", 
                "she said : fourth , we have a robust counter-terrorism strategy , that has proved successful over many years .", 
                "but as the nature of the threat we face becomes more complex , more fragmented , more hidden , especially online , the strategy needs to keep up .", 
                "so in light of what we are learning about the changing threat , we need to review britain 's counter-terrorism strategy to make sure the police and security services have all the powers they need .",
