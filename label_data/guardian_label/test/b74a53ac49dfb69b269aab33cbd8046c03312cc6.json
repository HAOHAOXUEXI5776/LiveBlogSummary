                "@ itvallegra runs through the data from @ twitterid and @ twitterid on the different tribes supporting @ twitterid in the 2017 election # peston and here are the figures for all six groups , showing the percentage point increase in the proportion voting labour between 2015 and 2017 .", 
                "liberal youth : +14 young , disaffected jams : +12 liberal elite : +10 socially left behind : +8 comfortable britain : +1 traditional working class : +0 the largest group , by some measure , is comfortable britain .",

                "this point aside , what clearly emerges from our analysis is that labour 's advance in the 2015 election was strongest not in left-wing britain but rather in socially liberal britain , a section of the country that is distinguished not so much by class and occupation as by education and , above all , age .", 
                "indeed , the age divide in the level of support for labour is now bigger than the class divide - over half ( 53 % ) of the under forties voted labour compared with just 27 % of the over sixties .", 
                "labour 's advance in june then does not simply lie in the popularity of the more left-wing stance that the party adopted .", 
                "indeed , that may not have been particularly important at all .", 
                "rather , in an election in which brexit and immigration were also central issues , labour 's advance was strongest amongst those who were keenest on staying in the eu and those who were least concerned about immigration .", 
                "that suggests that if brexit does indeed go pear shaped and , as a result , britain has another election soon , one more heave from labour might be enough to win power .",

                "in this , he was echoing the position set out by jeremy corbyn in his marr interview .",

                "but mcdonnell also floated the possibility of the single market being reformed in such a way as to make it acceptable to labour .", 
                "( see 11.21am . )", 
                "he said : our view is that the single market at the moment , in terms of the decision of the referendum - [ it ] is difficult to see how we can maintain within , with all the four freedoms that need to be guaranteed .", 
                "however , you know we 're talking to our european colleagues [ about ] what reforms can take place , how we can achieve a relationship which receives the benefits of the single market .", 
                "so i think we 're moving on in these discussions .", 
                "he signalled that he was in favour of a brexit transition lasting longer than two years .", 
                "on the subject of the transition , he said : we made it very very clear , there had to be a transition deal [ the conservatives have ] set this two year period , we 've said as short as possible but as long as necessary .", 
                "so we 've got this flexibility we think there 's an element of flexibility beyond the two years that might be necessary in certain sectors of work .", 
                "when it was put to him that chuka umunna , the labour mp , was saying labour backed a transition lasting up to four years , he replied : chuka and i , there 's not a cigarette paper between us . ''", 
                "but mcdonnell did subsequently admit he was not proposing that the uk should stay in the single market indefinitely , as umunna is .", 
                "mcdonnell said the next labour manifesto would address the issue of what to do about student debt .", 
                "the last manifesto just committed the party to getting rid of tuition fees ( ie , helping future students but not past students ) , but shortly before polling day jeremy corbyn gave an interview to nme floating the prospect of labour writing off some student tuition fee debt .", 
                "mcdonnell said : in the preparation for the next general election our next manifesto , we 're going to look at all the debt itself .",

                "the ifs said that claims that writing off all student tuition fee debt would cost \u00a3 100bn were wrong , and that if only the debt incurred by the increase in tuition fees from \u00a3 3,000 to \u00a3 9,000 were included , the cost of writing it off would be \u00a3 10bn by 2050 .",
