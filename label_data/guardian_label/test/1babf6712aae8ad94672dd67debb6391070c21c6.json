                "gordon brown , the former labour prime minister , has accused david cameron of a double betrayal '' of scotland that could blow the union apart '' .", 
                "in a speech to glasgow university , brown said that the scotland bill currently going through the commons does not honour the promises made to scotland by cameron and his labour and lib dem counterparts in the vow '' , the statement made promising further devolution shortly before the independence referendum .", 
                "these promises were then fleshed out in recommendations from the cross-party smith commission .", 
                "in the text of the speech released to the media brown said : the powers that the scottish parliament were promised - and need but have yet to be given - are the clear and unambiguous right to top up welfare benefits and an end to any suggestion that a uk government can prevent the scottish parliament administering such change if it decides to do so .", 
                "in an apparent reference to child tax credits , he said it was particularly important to give the scottish parliament powers to top up benefits because cameron was also breaking promises to protect the poor .", 
                "without the changes that give the parliamentary welfare top-up powers to scotland , we face a perfect storm - an explosive cocktail of measures that could blow the union apart - the conservative government defying the smith proposals on welfare , the very issue where their controversial imposition of cuts hits scotland hard .", 
                "the government should avoid what would be seen as a double betrayal - breaking their promises to the poor and breaking their promise to deliver the smith recommendations in full on the very powers that are needed to counteract welfare cuts and the austerity they bring .", 
                "the scotland bill will have its report stage in the commons later this month , and brown said the government should accept amendments making it explicit that holyrood does have the power to top up benefits and making it clear that westminster does not have a veto in this area .", 
                "brown said that , without these changes , cameron would be breaking his promise to implement the smith commission proposals in full .", 
                "conservative members of the european parliament have voted against a recommendation requiring big companies to disclose their gender pay gap , despite it being their party 's policy in westminster .", 
                "that 's all from me for today .", 
                "thanks for the comments ."
