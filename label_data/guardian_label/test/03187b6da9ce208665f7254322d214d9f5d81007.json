                "the uk could have to pay an extra \u00a3 5bn to the eu if the transition period lasts beyond december 2020 , as theresa may wants , mps were told .", 
                "the government has publicly said that the amount it will pay the eu as it leaves is between \u00a3 35bn and \u00a3 39bn .", 
                "but sir bill cash , the conservative mp who chairs the committee , said the committee had been told this figure was based on the assumption that the transition would conclude at the end of december 2020 ( which is what the eu wants ) , not at the end of march 2021 ( which is what the uk is proposing ) .", 
                "cash said : it is our adviser 's view that under the arrangements in prospect , although the government and the eu reached agreement on the principle of the amount of money [ to be paid by the uk ] , the agreement only covers the period up to the end of 2020 .", 
                "if the transition lasts beyond 2020 , then this could require the uk to make payments into the eu budget for 2021 as well , and therefore from january 2021 we 'd then be paying into the eu 's new long-term budget and the net result of this is that the additional costs could run into billions of pounds , and the estimate is between \u00a3 4bn and \u00a3 5bn .", 
                "walked did not dispute this , and barrow actually confirmed that the \u00a3 39bn figure was based upon the assumption that the transition would end in 2020 .", 
                "but barrow also claimed that there was not much difference between the eu and uk proposals for the transition .", 
                "walker said the government wanted more feedback from the eu about its brexit plans .", 
                "eu leaders routine complain that they have not heard enough from london about what britain wants after brexit .", 
                "but walker claimed the government had already provided quite a lot of information about what it wants , in papers published last summer , and he said it was frustrating how little feedback it had received from the eu .", 
                "he said : we have set out many of our positions on the future relationship already .", 
                "we published a large number of papers over the last summer .", 
                "i think it has been , to be frank - and i 've said this to eu colleagues , who would not be surprised to hear me say it - it has been one of the frustrations of the sequential approach that they have asked us to take that we have n't been able to get the feedback and engagement on all of those papers that we might have liked .", 
                "walker claimed that the full alignment '' promised as a possible means of avoiding a hard border in ireland would not involve northern ireland taking eu rules across the board '' .", 
                "in the joint report ( pdf ) published in december , in paragraph 49 , the uk proposed three alternative means of avoiding a hard border , that last of which would involve full '' regulatory alignment .", 
                "but walker insisted this did not mean wholesale adoption of eu regulations in northern ireland .", 
                "he said : even option c is focused on those areas which underpin north-south cooperation and have already been agreed by devolved government in northern ireland as areas of north-south cooperation , or indeed are coming under the good friday/belfast agreement .", 
                "so i think this is very much where alignment needs to be maintained to maintain that existing relationship .", 
                "it is not talking about full alignment , or taking eu rules across the broad .", 
                "it 's an important distinction to make .", 
                "also , as [ david davis ] has pointed out , we can look at full alignment as outcomes-based , rather than necessarily based on rule-taking .", 
                "for the record , this is what paragraph 49 says : the united kingdom remains committed to protecting north-south cooperation and to its guarantee of avoiding a hard border .", 
                "any future arrangements must be compatible with these overarching requirements .", 
                "the united kingdom 's intention is to achieve these objectives through the overall eu-uk relationship .", 
                "should this not be possible , the united kingdom will propose specific solutions to address the unique circumstances of the island of ireland .", 
                "in the absence of agreed solutions , the united kingdom will maintain full alignment with those rules of the internal market and the customs union which , now or in the future , support north-south cooperation , the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 agreement .", 
                "barrow suggested that the uk have to implement more eu law during the transition than previously assumed .", 
                "david davis , the brexit secretary , has repeatedly played down the significance of the uk agreeing to implement new eu law during the transition on the grounds that it takes almost two years for new eu laws to be implemented anyway ( meaning that the uk will have been consulted about new rules coming into force ) .", 
                "barrow said that this applied to secondary eu law ( directives and regulations ) .", 
                "he also said there would be no new primary eu law ( new treaties ) .", 
                "but , in response to a question from david jones , the former brexit minister , barrow conceded that there would be new tertiary legislation coming into force affecting the uk .", 
                "( jones cited fisheries discard rules as an example . )", 
                "barrow said this was why the uk wanted a joint committee to be set up during the transition to allow the uk to be consulted on these measures .", 
                "types of eu legislation parliament barrow played down the prospect of the uk being able to block new eu legislation it does not like during the transition .", 
                "asked by jones if the uk would be able to say no to new eu laws , barrow said : the provisions within the joint committee will be so that we can raise concerns and seek to resolve those concerns .", 
                "that is what this is about .", 
                "walker conceded that the eu has not yet agreed to allow the uk to sign trade deals during the transition .", 
                "he said the uk wanted to be able to sign trade deals during the transition on the basis that it would not be able to implement them until after the transition is over .", 
                "but it was put to him that this appears to conflict with a line in the eu 's transition position paper ( pdf ) saying during the transition the uk may not become bound by international agreements entered into in its own capacity in the areas of exclusive competence of the union , unless authorised to do so by the union '' .", 
                "walker said this issue had yet to be resolved .", 
                "he said : this is a point clearly for negotiation , when we are taking the position that we do want to be able to reach those agreements , we do want to be able to sign those agreements , but we wo n't be bringing them into force in a way that conflates with our commitments under the implementation period .",
