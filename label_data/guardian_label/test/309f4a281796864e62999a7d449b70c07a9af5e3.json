                "as the referendum clock ticks down towards sunday 's vote , there is still an outside chance it will not even go ahead .",

                "human rights group the council of europe has alaready expressed unhappiness with the vote , partly due to the speed of the process and also the question being asked .", 
                "meanwhile the latest poll shows a slight lead for the yes side - those in favour of accepting the creditors ' proposals .", 
                "the alco polling institute poll , published in the ethnos newspaper , showed 44.8 % for yes , 43.4 % for no and 11.8 % undecided .", 
                "a poster at a bus stop reads 'yes to greece , yes to the euro ' .", 
                "debets/demotix/corbis a no poster with the of the german finance minister wolfgang sch\u00e4uble .", 
                "debets/demotix/corbis finance minister yanis varoufakis has already said he would resign if the yes vote won the day .", 
                "meanwhile greek prime minister alexis tsipras remained defiant as he used another tv appearance to repeat his call for a no vote .", 
                "he hit out at former prime ministers who had lined up to support the yes side , and also suggested the imf , which on thursday said greece would need an extra \u20ac60bn of funding and that debt relief had to be part of any new bailout , could have spoken up earlier .", 
                "jasper lawler , market analyst at cmc markets uk , said : post-referendum looks pretty bleak for greece either way but a 'no ' vote carries a lot more short term risk .", 
                "evidence from the past five months is surely enough to show that muddling out-of-touch bureaucrats in athens and the eurozone will not reach a deal before there 's a banking crisis .", 
                "without the european central bank 's emergency funding , estimates are that greece 's banks are days from insolvency , even with only 60 euros being withdrawn a day under capital controls .", 
                "later come major rallies for both sides in athens , as supporters gather in the last hours before the vote ."
