                "just as the row about antisemitism in the labour party was starting to die down , the chief rabbi , ephraim mirvis , has propelled it back on to the front pages with a forceful article in the daily telegraph .", 
                "it is the first time he has commented since the labour mp naz shah was suspended last week , prompting ken livingstone to try defending her with his bizarre ramblings about hitler .", 
                "nick sutton ( @ suttonnick ) wednesday 's telegraph front page -chief rabbi : drain labour 's poison # tomorrowspaperstoday # bbcpapers there are three key points in the article .", 
                "mirvis suggests he is worried that the inquiry into antisemitism in the labour party could just amount to political posturing '' .", 
                "he said he welcomed jeremy corbyn 's decision to announce the inquiry , but he said he was worried about people saying the allegations about antisemitism in the party were not genuine , but were just a smear '' .", 
                "in recent days , we have heard anti-semitism in the labour party described variously as a smear '' and as mood music '' being manipulated by political opponents of jeremy corbyn .", 
                "there has been nothing more disheartening in this story than the suggestion that this is more about politics than about substance .", 
                "the worst of mistakes , in trying to address this problem , would be to treat it as a political attack which requires a political solution .", 
                "if this inquiry turns out to be no more than a sticking plaster , designed to placate and diffuse until after the elections this week , the problem will surely get worse and not better .", 
                "jeremy corbyn has stated that his party will not tolerate anti-semitism in any form , '' and i very much hope that this inquiry will deliver on that pledge and be followed by decisive action .", 
                "all political parties share in the responsibility to rid our society of anti-semitism but we can not achieve that objective with political posturing or empty promises of action never to be fulfilled .", 
                "one person making the smear '' claim has been corbyn 's close ally diane abbott .", 
                "she told the andrew marr show on sunday : it 's a smear to say that labour has a problem with antisemitism .", 
                "it is something like a smear against ordinary party members . ''", 
                "mirvis argues that attacking zionism amounts to antisemitism .", 
                "zionism is a belief in the right to jewish self-determination in a land that has been at the centre of the jewish world for more than 3,000 years .", 
                "one can no more separate it from judaism than separate the city of london from great britain .", 
                "open a jewish daily prayer book used in any part of the world and zionism will leap out at you .", 
                "the innumerable references to the land of israel are inescapable and demonstrative zionism is a movement celebrated by people right across the political spectrum , all over the world , and requires no endorsement or otherwise of the particular policies of any israeli government at any time .", 
                "but to those people who have nevertheless sought to redefine zionism , who vilify and delegitimize it , i say : be under no illusions - you are deeply insulting not only the jewish community but countless others who instinctively reject the politics of distortion and demonisation .", 
                "and , in particular , he effectively accuses livingstone of spreading antisemitism .", 
                "to those who so eagerly reach for a vicious holocaust reference in order to exact the maximum amount of pain and offence upon zionists '' , i say : you are spreading that ancient and insidious virus of anti-semitism .", 
                "i will be posting reaction to the mirvis article as it comes in .", 
                "here is the agenda for the day .",
