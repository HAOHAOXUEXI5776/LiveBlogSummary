                "this funding is across the next two years as we transition to the nff .", 
                "spending plans for years beyond 2019-20 will be set out in a future spending review .", 
                "but as a result of this investment , core funding for schools and high needs will rise from almost \u00e2\u00a3 41 billion in 2017-18 to \u00e2\u00a3 42.4 billion in 2018-19 .", 
                "in 2019-20 this will rise again to \u00e2\u00a3 43.5 billion .", 
                "this represents \u00e2\u00a3 1.3 billion in additional investment : \u00e2\u00a3 416 million more than was set aside at the last spending review for the core school budget in 2018-19 , and \u00e2\u00a3 884 million more in 2019-20 .", 
                "it will mean that the total schools budget will increase by \u00e2\u00a3 2.6 billion between this year and 2019-20 , and per pupil funding will now be maintained in real terms for the remaining two years of the spending review period to 2019-20 .", 
                "on where the extra money will come from the \u00e2\u00a3 1.3 billion additional investment in core schools funding which i am announcing today will be funded in full from efficiencies and savings i have identified from within my department 's existing budget , rather than higher taxes or more debt .", 
                "this of course requires difficult decisions , but i believe it is right to prioritise core schools funding , even as we continue the vital task of repairing the public finances .", 
                "by making savings and efficiencies , i am maximising the proportion of my department 's budget which is allocated directly to frontline head teachers who can then use their professional expertise to ensure that it is spent where it will have the greatest possible impact .", 
                "i have challenged my civil servants to find efficiencies , as schools are having to .", 
                "i want to set out briefly the savings and efficiencies that i will secure : efficiencies and savings across our capital budget can release \u00e2\u00a3 420 million .", 
                "the majority of this will be from healthy pupils capital funding - from which we will make savings of \u00e2\u00a3 315 million .", 
                "this reflects reductions in forecast revenue from the soft drinks industry levy .", 
                "every pound of england 's share of spending from the levy will continue to be invested in improving child health , including \u00e2\u00a3 100 million in 2018-19 for healthy pupils capital .", 
                "we remain committed to an ambitious programme that delivers choice , innovation and higher standards for parents .", 
                "in delivering the programme , and the plans for a further 140 free schools announced at the last budget , we will work more efficiently to release savings of \u00e2\u00a3 280 million up to 2019 20 .", 
                "this will include working more collaboratively with local authorities to provide free schools to meet basic need so that 30 of the 140 schools are delivered through the local authority route rather than the central free schools route .", 
                "across the dfe resource budget which is over \u00e2\u00a3 60 billion per year i will also reprioritise \u00e2\u00a3 250 million in 2018-19 and \u00e2\u00a3 350 million in 2019-20 to fund the increase in core schools budget spending i am announcing today .", 
                "i will , for example , seek to identify \u00e2\u00a3 200m that i can redirect from the department 's central programmes that support schools on relatively narrow areas of their work .",
