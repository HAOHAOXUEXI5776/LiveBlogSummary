                "because of what 's happened in the vacuum of syria , as well as the battle-hardened elements of isis that grew out of al qaeda in iraq during the course of the iraq war , it 's going to take time for us to be able to roll them back .", 
                "and it is going to take time for us to be able to form the regional coalition that 's going to be required so that we can reach out to sunni tribes in some of the areas that isis has occupied , and make sure that we have allies on the ground in combination with the airstrikes that we 've already conducted .", 
                "so the bottom line is this : our objective is clear , and that is to degrade and destroy isil so that it 's no longer a threat not just to iraq but also the region and to the united states .", 
                "in order for us to accomplish that , the first phase has been to make sure that we 've got an iraqi government that 's in place and that we are blunting the momentum that isil was carrying out .", 
                "and the airstrikes have done that .", 
                "but now what we need to do is make sure that we 've got the regional strategy in place that can support an ongoing effort - not just in the air but on the ground - to move that forward ."
