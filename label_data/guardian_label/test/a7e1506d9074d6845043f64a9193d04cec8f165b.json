                "it 's a question that plagues a generation of young people , and now evidence shows how few people are getting on the property ladder : home ownership in england has fallen to its lowest level in 30 years .", 
                "the reasons behind our inability to own a home are clear ( there is a huge gap between earnings and property prices ) , but what can be done about it is less certain .", 
                "what we do know is that it 's now not just a problem in london - according to a new report by the resolution foundation thinktank , greater manchester is also seeing as big a slump in ownership since its peak in the early 2000s .", 
                "other areas are also seeing sharp drops .", 
                "the resolution foundation said home ownership across england reached a peak in april 2003 ( when 71 % of households owned their home ) either outright or with a mortgage , but by february this year the figure had fallen to 64 % .", 
                "so , what can be done ?", 
                "this week jonn elledge , editor of the new statesman 's cities site , argued that we 've been obsessed with house buying since the days of margaret thatcher , but those days are long gone .", 
                "he says , instead , we should focus on improving the option of renting ( making tenancies were longer and tenants ' rights stronger ) so it 's more appealing .", 
                "however , some people writing beneath the piece disagreed .", 
                "one commenter said : a person should own their home and have the right to do pretty much whatever they want with it , which does n't happen when renting and someone else owns and can make rules and demand payment every month in exchange for a roof over one 's head .", 
                "that needs to be a basic right , not even something to discuss . ''", 
                "so what do you think ?", 
                "should we offer a variety of tenure options instead of obsessing over home ownership or is this an idea people should not give up on ?", 
                "join us from 12pm-2pm today to debate the future of housing .",
