                "separate surveys added to the gloomy showing that us factory orders fell 1.7 % in august , compared with expectations of a 1.3 % decline , and business activity in new york contracted for the first time in eight months in september .",

                "good morning , and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy , the financial markets , the eurozone and business .", 
                "there 's a running joke in financial circles that every us jobs report is the most important ever .", 
                "that might be a slight exaggeration this month , but today 's non-farm payroll report still has the power to shift the markets the september non-farm payroll , due at 1.30pm bst , will show how many new jobs were created in america last month .", 
                "it 'll also show whether workers benefitted from the recovery with higher wages .", 
                "economists predict that just over 200,000 new jobs were created last month , up from a disappointing 173,000 last month .", 
                "scofield ! ! !", 
                "( @ scofield fx ) the market expects the us to have created 201,000 non-farm jobs in september , up from a poor 173,000 in august .", 
                "# nfpguesses that would put more pressure on the federal reserve to take the plunge and raise borrowing costs before the end of 2015 except it 's not quite that simple any more .", 
                "the fed is also worried about the state of the global economy , and the impact of china 's slowdown on the financial system .", 
                "chris weston of ig says traders are getting a bit exhausted '' about the steady stream of allegedly game-changing '' data releases , especially when none of them actually prompt a change of policy .", 
                "he also reckons the earning data should be interesting : the single most influential issue that should jump out immediately is that forecasters are expecting wages to grow 2.4 % ( range 2 % to 2.5 % ) .", 
                "this would effectively be the strongest pace of wage growth since late 2009 and should increase the implied probability of a december hike closer , if not above 50 % .", 
                "there 's not much else on the calendar today , alas , apart from uk construction data at 9.30am bst , and new spanish unemployment data and in the eurozone , junior ministers should be working on the list of bailout measures greece must take in return for its next loan payment , ahead of a full eurogroup meeting on monday .", 
                "yannis koutsomitis ( @ yannikouts ) # eurogroup working group meeting today in brussels to specify timetable of prior actions and tranches for # greece ."
