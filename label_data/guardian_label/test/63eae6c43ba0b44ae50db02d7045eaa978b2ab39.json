                "jeremy hunt , the health secretary , has made a last-minute bid to junior doctors to call off tomorrow 's strike .", 
                "he said that withdrawing labour from emergency cover would amount to crossing the rubicon '' and he hinted that the government could outlaw strike action of this kind in the future .", 
                "in a statement to mps hunt also said that the new contract for junior doctors offered them more premium pay for working on saturday than almost anyone else in the private or public sector gets .", 
                "he said : i wish to appeal directly to all junior doctors not to withdraw emergency cover which creates particular risks for a & es , maternity units and intensive care units .", 
                "i understand the frustration many junior doctors feel that because of pressures on the nhs frontline they are not always able to give patients the highest quality of care that they would like to .", 
                "i understand that some doctors may disagree with the government over our seven-day nhs plans and particularly the introduction of a new contract .", 
                "i also understand that doctors work incredibly hard , including at weekends , and that strong feelings exist on the single remaining disagreement of substance , saturday premium pay .", 
                "but the new contract offers junior doctors who work frequently at weekends more saturday premium pay than nurses , paramedics and the assistants who work in their own operating theatres , more than police officers , more than firefighters , and nearly every other worker in the public and private sectors .", 
                "the tory mp julian lewis said that junior doctors had not specifically been balloted about withdrawing emergency care .", 
                "he asked hunt if he agreed that if patients died as a result , public demand for a law stopping a strike like this happening again could be irresistible '' .", 
                "hunt hinted he was open to the idea .", 
                "in reply to lewis he said : [ lewis ] is right .", 
                "the public will be extremely disappointed that professionals are putting patients at risk in this way .", 
                "i think it is extremely tragic that they are doing that .", 
                "so i 'm afraid i do think this is a crossing of the rubicon , a crossing of the line , in a way that has not happened before .", 
                "i think it is totally tragic and i would support his concern on that point .", 
                "hunt is facing calls for a nationwide inquiry into the deaths of highly vulnerable patients in nhs care after it emerged that just one in seven such fatalities in hospitals in england have been investigated .", 
                "the government is engaging in shabby parliamentary tactics '' as it tries to block extra help for 3,000 unaccompanied child refugees stranded in europe , according to mps and peers .", 
                "american warships may join european union vessels off the coast of libya by the summer in a nato-led attempt to slow the flow of refugees from africa into europe , it emerged at a meeting of the g5 world leaders in hanover .", 
                "the government has suffered a fresh defeat in the lords over its housing plans as peers pushed for higher energy efficiency standards to cut carbon emissions .", 
                "as the press association reports , voting was 253 to 205 - a majority of 48 - for all new homes in england built from april 2018 to meet the carbon compliance standard '' .",
