                "the departure of cohn would have been a hammer blow to the president , on top of all the other recent resignations , which suggests there may well have been a hint of political calculation behind friday 's events .", 
                "bannon 's departure buys trump time when he is starting to look isolated and even a little beleaguered .", 
                "the big question is how we move on from here and whether the president still has the authority to move forward on any key policy areas , such as tax reform .", 
                "there are indeed reports that trump may now try and push through the long-promised tax reforms in an attempt to at least get some of his policies on the books .", 
                "on the economic front , there is little to look forward to today .", 
                "most of the big news comes later in the week , not least with the jackson hole summit of central bankers in the us .", 
                "investors will be looking for any signs of further interest rate moves from the fed , and any hints from the european central bank about a slow withdrawal of its bond buying programme .", 
                "however , there have already been suggestions that the ecb president mario draghi is unlikely to say anything too informative .", 
                "cmc 's hewson said : the scope for surprises was diminished somewhat by ecb sources at the end of last week when it was reported the ecb president mario draghi would not be making any comment on monetary policy when he speaks later this week .", 
                "this reticence to comment may also have something to do with the fact that there appears to some concern on the governing council about an overshoot to the upside for the euro , particularly given the recent weakness of the us dollar .", 
                "here is our preview of the jackson hole event : global investors look to jackson hole for signs of how qe will end read more also on the agenda later in the week are french and german ppi numbers and the latest second quarter gdp figures from the uk ."
