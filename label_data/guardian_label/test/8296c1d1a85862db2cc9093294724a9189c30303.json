                "in his response ( see 12.23pm ) johnson , who recently accused the remain campaign of promoting a colossal , glutinous tide of nonsense '' , made essentially two claims : 1 ) that the fact that cameron was preparing for the remain campaign before the renegotiation was over shows that the renegotiation was a sham ; and 2 ) that there was something untoward about cameron dealing in this way with a firm reliant on government contracts .",
