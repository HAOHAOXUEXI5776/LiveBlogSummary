                "ed miliband has accused david cameron getting his excuses in early '' and blaming global factors for the failure of the government 's economic strategy .", 
                "speaking in the house of commons , miliband said that cameron tried to say that labour was to blame for all the economic problems before 2010 , but was now saying global factors were to blame for the problems currently facing the problems .", 
                "cameron , who was in the commons for a statement on the g20 , rejected this .", 
                "you can read the full exchanges at 5.07pm .", 
                "cameron has refused to comment on suggestions that the government deficit-reduction programme is falling further behind schedule .", 
                "when labour 's john woodcock put this idea to cameron , he just said that the government had cut the defici by a third and that the latest figures would be announced , as usual , in the autumn statement .", 
                "cameron has urged mps to quash some of the wholly false arguments '' being made about the impact of the eu/us free trade deal , the transatlantic trade and investment partnership ( ttip ) on the nhs .", 
                "campaigners claim that it will lead to american firms having the right to take over legal services .", 
                "cameron said that karel de gucht , the eu 's trade commissioner , has explicitly denied this .", 
                "( see 4.58pm . )", 
                "he told mps : we need to work hard to quash some of the wholly false arguments that are being put about by opponents of ttip .", 
                "this does not in any way have to affect our national health service .", 
                "cameron also claimed that there was nothing sinister about the inclusion of an investor state dispute settlement provision ( isds ) in the ttip .", 
                "these were a feature of every trade deal britain has signed , he said , and he claimed britain had never lost a case .", 
                "he also claimed that some people who were lobbying mps about this did not fully understand the issues .", 
                "i do think , and i hope as members of parliament we can all try to do this , when you get that barrage of emails - people sometimes have signed up without fully understanding every part of what they 've been asked to sign - people want to spread some fear about this thing , and we have a role , i think , of trying to explain properly why these things are good for our country .", 
                "he said the european central bank should adopt a more activist stance to promote growth in europe .", 
                "britain and america have shown that an active monetary policy , delivered by an independent central bank , can make a real difference .", 
                "and i think , with the signs of rather staggered growth in europe , then there 's a need for the european central bank to take that action as well .", 
                "he signalled that he was planning to give the charity commission new powers to stop extremists abusing charity law .", 
                "charities could also be given legal advice to help them expel extremists , he hinted .", 
                "there is a problem with some charities that have had charity status that have used their existence to support extremism or the extremist narrative .", 
                "there are two things we need to do here , which we have been looking at through the extremism taskforce .", 
                "one is to help organisations who might need to take lawyers or legal advice to throw extremists out of their organisations .", 
                "the second is to make sure the charity commission has the resources and the teeth it needs , including possibly new legal powers , so it can take action too .", 
                "he signalled that he would approve of extremists fighting with islamic state being charged with treason .",
