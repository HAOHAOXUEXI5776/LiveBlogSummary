                "this morning tony blair was on radio 4 talking about leadership and perhaps his role in british political life now is to provide a one-man masterclass in what it 's all about .", 
                "( see 10.21am . )", 
                "next year we may eventually get the iraq inquiry report , a case study in what happens when messianic leadership goes wrong .", 
                "but , on northern ireland , blair is entitled to look back on his record with pride .", 
                "there are few other examples in living memory of a prime minister wrestling with so much history , and twisting it into a better shape .", 
                "it is hard to imagine david cameron being questioned in the same way in a decade 's time about something so important .", 
                "all of which explains the strain of intense indignation that ran through his entire evidence this afternoon , which he tried to conceal with varying degrees of success .", 
                "although blair is resigned to being criticised over iraq , he clearly finds the idea of being attacked for what he did in northern ireland unreasonable and mildly baffling .", 
                "the debate about ends versus means is a perennial one in politics , and blair defended ends-ism ( ends justify means ) about as well as anyone , saying peace simply would n't have happened without making unsavoury compromises with terrorists .", 
                "( see 3.15pm , for example . )", 
                "he was also quite persuasive when he argued that , far from being a total sell-out to sinn fein , his policy fell far short of what they actually wanted ( a total amnesty ) .", 
                "as henry mcdonald says , you can argue about whether sinn fein really would have gone back to war .", 
                "( see 4.32am . )", 
                "but the process could have stalled without the ira necessarily taking up arms again , and blair 's assertion that otr concessions were essential for the process to move forward is highly credible .", 
                "here are the main news points .", 
                "blair warned that northern ireland peace process was fragile and that the government had to be careful about not letting it collapse .", 
                "all i 'm saying to people in government now is that you have inherited a peace process that worked .", 
                "so be careful with it , because it is fragile still .", 
                "( he implied that he thought the government was being a bit cavalier about it .", 
                "perhaps he 's thinking of stories like this . )", 
                "he said he disagreed with theresa villiers ' decision to say that the letters of assurance written to otrs ( on the runs ) were worthless .", 
                "he would not have taken that decision , he said .", 
                "he said time will tell whether it is a mistake .", 
                "he said the northern ireland peace process would have collapsed if his government had not given the assurances it did to otrs who were not wanted in connection with any crimes .", 
                "the issue of otrs was absolutely critical to the peace process and at certain points became fundamental to it .", 
                "if i had been saying we are not dealing with this in any way at all , you can never be certain of these things but i think it is likely that the process would have collapsed .", 
                "after the good friday agreement there was a constant battle to keep the peace process alive , he said .", 
                "the worse moment came in december 2006 .", 
                "it was on a knife edge .", 
                "i actually thought for a time during that period we 'd lost the whole thing .", 
                "i remember having a conversation with [ then downing street chief of staff ] jonathan ( powell ) and others at the time saying this thing - we just ca n't rescue it .", 
                "if we had n't managed to find a way to get ourselves over what was a horribly difficult period , we would not have got the [ northern ireland ] executive up in may 2007 .", 
                "he rejected claims that the system set up to offer letters of assurance to otrs who were not wanted by the police was secret .", 
                "john reid actually answered a parliamentary question about it when he was northern ireland secretary , he said , including information about how many people were affected .", 
                "he said that press reports falsely saying that otrs were offered an amnesty were to a large extent to blame for the hurt felt by the relatives of ira victims .", 
                "he apologised to victims for the fact that the downey trial collapsed .", 
                "as prime minister , he was responsible for the process , and if a more formal process had been established , the mistake that led to john downey getting a letter when he should not have done might not have happened , he said .", 
                "i accept full responsibility , because i was prime minster , for not having put in place the structure for this procedure that might have meant in the downey case that the letter would not have been sent and therefore the trial would have proceeded .", 
                "i am sorry for those people and i apologise to those people who have suffered as a result of that .", 
                "but i am not going to apologise for sending those letters to those who should have received those letters , because without having done that , we would not have a northern ireland peace process .", 
                "these people have suffered enormously from what has happened .", 
                "he said the compromises involved in the peace process , including prisoner releases , were justified because they led to a better future .", 
                "there were many of those people free , out today , that committed acts of terrorism that are repugnant to any decent-minded person .", 
                "but i believed in the end that we were n't going to get peace in the future unless we tried to draw a line .", 
                "and this is always difficult , it is the hardest thing you ever do in a peace process .", 
                "and i remember visiting the families of victims in northern ireland , and victims , those ruc officers that had been maimed and disfigured , and [ some of them felt ] a deep sense of betrayal at the process we were engaged in .", 
                "and i understand that completely .", 
                "but my motivation for doing this was to stop further death and destruction and bloodshed .", 
                "and to be in a situation where northern ireland had a chance of a different future .", 
                "there is nothing that i 'm ever going to say that is going to take away the feeling that people have of anger and anguish and even betrayal .", 
                "but i do say the northern ireland peace process was the right thing to do , was a necessary thing to do and it has , for all its faults and difficulties , made our country better .", 
                "he defended jonathan powell 's decision to warn rita o'hare , an otr who was wanted by police , not to return to northern ireland .", 
                "she was a strong supporter of the peace process , and , if she had been arrested , the process would have been damaged , he said .", 
                "he said sinn fein thought the letters of assurance sent out were meaningless because they were going to people who were not wanted by the policy anyway .", 
                "they wanted those who were facing charges to receive some form of amnesty .", 
                "he said it would have been better to have had a more open , formal system for the despatch of letters of assurances .", 
                "that 's all from me for today .",
