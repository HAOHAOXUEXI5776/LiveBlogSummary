                "reuters has filed this take on the latest developments : a shallow , 6.3-magnitude earthquake shook north korea on sunday , suggesting it had detonated a sixth nuclear device , hours after it said it had developed an advanced hydrogen bomb that possesses great destructive power .", 
                "the earthquake struck 75 km ( 45 miles ) north/north-west of kimchaek .", 
                "previous recent tremors in the region have been caused by nuclear tests , which if the case this time round , is bound to increase the tension hours after us president donald trump and japanese prime minister shinzo abe talked by phone about the escalating nuclear crisis .", 
                "the quake was only 10 km deep , the us geological survey said , again suggesting a nuclear device .", 
                "eight minutes later , china 's earthquake administration said it has detected another quake in north korea of magnitude 4.6 , which it termed as a collapse and a suspected explosion .", 
                "the coordinates of the two quakes were almost identical , according to figures provided by the administration .", 
                "witnesses in the chinese city of yanji , on the border with north korea , said they felt a tremor that lasted roughly 10 seconds , followed by an aftershock .", 
                "the hydrogen bomb report by north korea 's official kcna news agency comes amid heightened regional tension following pyongyang 's two tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles ( icbm ) in july that potentially could fly about 10,000km ( 6,200 miles ) , putting many parts of the mainland united states within range .", 
                "under third-generation leader kim jong-un , north korea has been pursuing a nuclear device small and light enough to fit on a long-range ballistic missile , without affecting its range and making it capable of surviving re-entry into the earth 's atmosphere .", 
                "north korea , which carries out its nuclear and missile programmes in defiance of un security council resolutions and sanctions , recently succeeded in making a more advanced hydrogen bomb that will be loaded on to an icbm , kcna said .", 
                "the h-bomb , the explosive power of which is adjustable from tens kiloton to hundreds kiloton , is a multi-functional thermonuclear nuke with great destructive power which can be detonated even at high altitudes for super-powerful emp ( electromagnetic pulse ) attack according to strategic goals , kcna said .", 
                "all components of the h-bomb were homemade and all the processes were put on the juche basis , thus enabling the country to produce powerful nuclear weapons as many as it wants , kcna quoted kim as saying .", 
                "juche is north korea 's homegrown ideology of self-reliance that is a mix of marxism and extreme nationalism preached by state founder kim il sung , the current leader 's grandfather .", 
                "it says its weapons programmes are needed to counter us aggression .", 
                "north korea offered no evidence for its latest claim , and kim dong-yub , a military expert at kyungnam universitys institute of far eastern studies in seoul , was sceptical .", 
                "referring to tens to hundreds of kilotons , it doesnt appear to be talking about a fully fledged h-bomb .", 
                "it 's more likely a boosted nuclear device , kim said , referring to an atomic bomb which uses some hydrogen isotopes to boost explosive yield .", 
                "a hydrogen bomb can achieve thousands of kilotons of explosive yield massively more powerful than some 10 to 15 kilotons that north koreas last nuclear test in september was estimated to have produced , similar to the bomb dropped on hiroshima , japan , in 1945 ."
