                "for us it is very important that we are not considered as migrants .", 
                "words matter here we would like to make it quite clear that we are not migrants into the uk .", 
                "but we are the citizens of a state that belongs to the european union who can take jobs anywhere freely within the european union we do not want to go to the uk and take something from them .",

                "orban said there were 55,000 hungarians working in the uk .", 
                "they paid more in taxes than they claimed in benefits , he said .", 
                "according to our estimates , the hungarians working in the uk altogether pay more contributions and taxes than the benefits that they get .", 
                "so we belong to the world of the fair working people .", 
                "orban said that hungary and other countries in the visegrad group ( the czech republic , poland and slovakia ) were open to doing a deal with britain over changes to welfare rules .", 
                "at one point he said there was a good chance of a deal , and at another point he said the visegrad four ( v4 ) would be able to agree .",

                "i 'm sure that we will be able to find a solution which is going to be suitable for the hungarian employees , for the hungarian citizens , and that is also going to serve the requirements the government of david cameron set for itself .", 
                "cameron said he was still pushing his plan to stop eu migrants claiming inwork benefits in the uk for four years .", 
                "but he stressed that he was open to alternative proposals that might reduce the immigration pull factor .",

                "but in response to a question about a times story saying the government had changed his mind , he confirmed a rethink was underway .", 
                "he said : i do not really want to put new taxes onto anything .", 
                "but we do have to recognise that we face potentially in britain something of an obesity crisis .", 
                "when we look at the effect of obesity on not just diabetes , but the effect on heart disease , potentially on cancer , we look at the costs on the nhs , the life-shortening potential of these problems , we do need to have a fully worked-up programme to deal with this problem .", 
                "and we will be making announcements later in the year .", 
                "of course it would be far better if we could make progress on all these issues without having to resort to taxes .", 
                "that would be my intention .", 
                "but what matters is that we do make progresss .",

                "for the first time in two decades , the blairites , brownites and neutrals within the parliamentary labour party are fully as one .", 
                "it helps that corbyn managed to sack or sideline one of each in the only substantive moves of his reshuffle : dugher , pat mcfadden and maria eagle all made to walk the plank ; the first two with the frankly disgraceful accusation that they had been incompetent in their jobs .", 
                "accusations of disloyalty are always in the eye of the beholder and can be taken on the chin , but to be accused of incompetence is a mortal insult in politics , let alone john mcdonnell 's further jibe that those shadow ministers who resigned in protest at the mcfadden sacking were right-wing .", 
                "so we are left with an unprecedented alliance between the two branches of the labour party who have been at each other 's throats for 20 years , combined with the centrists who always refused to join either camp , all of them in a state of disillusionment or disgust at corbyn 's leadership .", 
                "james forsyth in the spectator says the reshuffle has left corbyn more powerful .",

                "it is important to understand that while the era of new labour might be the crucial period as far as younger supporters of corbyn and his supportive commentators are concerned , for the major players both around the leadership in westminster and in the country , it is neil kinnock 's leadership of the party that is marks labour 's fall from grace , not the blair-brown years .",

                "britain had to be ready for an increase , he said .", 
                "the bank of england is completely independent and it would be wholly inappropriate to put put any pressure [ on it ] and , by the way , people like mark carney [ the governor of the bank of england ] would not respond to that kind of pressure because they are more than capable of making their own decisions .",

                "that was the beginning of the exit , if you like , from the very , very low interest rates in the so-called ultra-loose monetary policy that was put in place during the crash .", 
                "of course there will come a point where that happens in britain , a decision made by our independent central bank .", 
                "rising interest rates can be a sign of a strong economy , and that was of course the justification the federal reserve used .", 
                "we 've got to make sure in our country , and this is a responsibility of the government , not the bank of england solely , that we are ready for whatever the interest rate environment is ; that this time , for example , in a way that we did n't do seven or eight years ago , we monitor overall level of indebtedness in our economy , that we take action to deal with particular booms or asset price bubbles , and things like buy-to-let mortgages , and i 've taken action in that space .", 
                "so we 've got to be ready .", 
                "but ultimately , if and when interest rates go up , that will be a sign of a stronger economy that is normalising after the extraordinary crisis of seven or eight years ago .", 
                "i will post more from the interview later .", 
                "here is the agenda for the day .",
