                "it is unusual to hear a uk broadcaster asking any snp figure about public service delivery in scotland , and this has let to complaints that the snp get an easy ride from the london media .", 
                "and so all credit to james naughtie for trying to make up for this on the today programme .", 
                "it did not make for riveting listening , but it was good public service journalism .", 
                "here are the key points from the interview .", 
                "sturgeon refused to say whether or not the snp would use the new powers scotland is getting in the scotland bill to vary income tax .", 
                "she would take a decision nearer the time , she said .", 
                "i 'm not going to rule out or rule in that [ putting up tax ] at the moment because it will be two years before we have flexible powers over income tax .", 
                "scotland already has the power to vary the basic rate of tax by up to 3p in the pound , but sturgeon said this had not been used because it would not be a particularly progressive way of raising revenue . ''", 
                "from next april the scottish government will get the power to vary the tax rate by 10p in the pound .", 
                "but sturgeon also appeared to rule out using this power , saying it was too inflexible .", 
                "we are not able to raise or lower the top rate without doing exactly the same to the basic rate , '' she explained .", 
                "scotland needed more flexible powers over tax , she said .", 
                "under the scotland bill it will get wide-ranging powers to vary income tax rates and bands , although the tax threshold will still be set in london .", 
                "she dismissed claims that scotland was underspending on health compared to england .", 
                "james naughtie quoted figures from the institute for fiscal studies saying that health spending in england went up 6 % in real terms between 2009-10 and 2015-16 , but that in scotland it only went up by 1 % in real terms .", 
                "sturgeon said that those figures do n't tell the whole story and that they did not take into account our non-profit distributing capital programme , which is what we had to introduce to compensate for cuts to capital budget '' .", 
                "she went on : we have passed on every single penny to the revenue budget of the health service that has come our way through the barnett formula via what are called consequentials when the snp government took office the health budget in scotland was around \u00a3 9bn .", 
                "today it is over \u00a3 12bn .", 
                "it is \u00a3 3bn higher than it was when we took office .", 
                "waiting times in the health service are lower .", 
                "so , good progress , but we are ambitious to do more .", 
                "we have prioritised health , we have protected the revenue budget of the health service , and spending per head on health is higher than it is in england .", 
                "she played down concerns about spending on schools in england going up more than spending on schools in scotland .", 
                "when naughtie put this to her , she said he was comparing apples with pears '' .", 
                "spending per head of population on education was higher in scotland than in england , she said .", 
                "she dismissed a figure suggesting the educational performance of deprived children in scotland is falling as one snapshot survey '' .", 
                "that was her reply when naughtie put it to her that a 2013 survey showed just 25 % of children performing well or very well at numeracy , compared with 29 % in 2011 .", 
                "she said that , on results for higher exams , the attainment gap had narrowed .", 
                "and since 2006 there had been a 50 % increase in the number of young people from deprived communties applying for university .", 
                "so the attainment gap is narrowing , '' she said .", 
                "but she said that she wanted to go further and faster '' .", 
                "she said she would be arguing very strongly '' for scotland and the uk to remain in the eu in the eu referendum .", 
                "she repeated her belief that , if the uk were to vote to leave the eu , that would undoubtedly spark demands for a second referendum [ on independence ] . ''", 
                "she said that labour was too divided under jeremy corbyn to win an election .", 
                "i think his big problem is that , although he hold these views , he ca n't carry his party behind those views he is not united labour on trident , on the economy , even on air strikes on syria .", 
                "on all of these big issues of the day labour is deeply divided and it may be the oldest political cliche in the book but divided parties do n't win elections .", 
                "if people in scotland do n't see jeremy scotland being able to unite labour , to become a credible alternative government , then what 's the point of voting labour .",
