                "as a consequence , they have only identified \u00a3 4.5bn a year towards easing the required cuts in the current budget in the two years to 2017-18 .", 
                "that means that they need to find \u00a3 30bn per year of real-terms reductions between this year and 2017-18 to fill the hole .", 
                "since they intend to shield the nhs and defence , this load would not be evenly spread .", 
                "reasonable people can differ about how to make sense of their plans .",

                "on similar terms , i think the equivalent number for the tories comes to a shade under 15 % .", 
                "after 2017-18 , when they have met their target , they intend to keep squeezing for a year , then increasing spending fast in the final year .",

                "i should note , by the way , that ukip has introduced one fine innovation - external audit of their plans .",

                "the liberal democrats have not spilled too much ink on defence but their pledge on trident to `` step down the nuclear ladder and end the unnecessary 24-hour nuclear patrols of the high seas '' has big implications .", 
                "it would allow the party to start reducing the readiness of the trident force immediately , by mothballing one or two submarines , and in the longer term buy fewer than the four replacement ballistic missile carrying submarines that the tories have committed to .", 
                "lib dem assertions that the submarine patrols are a relic of `` a cold war threat that no longer exists '' , or that campaigning against female genital mutilation should be a main plank of british foreign policy , are telltale signs that the party 's activists have had a big role in formulating this paper .", 
                "but given that anders fogh rasmussen , nato secretary general until last autumn , said in a radio 4 program that i presented last night that a new cold war has started , and there is a widespread view that the security climate in europe has chilled markedly , the manifesto 's language could sound odd to many .",

                "lord dannat , former head of the army , once tipped as a conservative minister , has warned that the party 's cuts to defence have caused many in the forces to switch to supporting ukip and there is some evidence in the party 's manifesto of it listening to expert advice .", 
                "the suggestion , for example , that the government reconsider which aircraft should fly off britain 's two new aircraft carriers ( in the hope that off the shelf conventional jets could be used instead of the highly costly f35b ) fits with the ideas that a great many raf and naval types express to me .", 
                "similarly , a ukip manifesto proposal for closer integration of the espionage community , with the various agencies answering to a new director of national intelligence , shows it 's listened to expert opinion and is trying to present the party as having serious ideas about government .", 
                "committing to maintaining the nato goal of spending 2 % of gdp on the military ( something the tories and labour wo n't do ) also allows ukip to argue it 's backing verbal commitment to the forces with hard cash .", 
                "ultimately , many in whitehall would argue that the smaller parties can suggest anything they 'd like in these manifestos , pleasing their base , while never being put to the test in government .",
