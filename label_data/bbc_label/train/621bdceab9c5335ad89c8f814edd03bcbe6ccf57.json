                "in his interview with evan today nigel farage argued that when thinking about how much a ukip government might need to cut spending , one needs to take the `` dynamic force '' of their proposed tax cuts into account .",

                "mr farage , though , seemed to suggest that ukip 's \u00a3 18bn of tax cuts could do quite a bit of the work of closing the current budget deficit by 2017-18 ( which is when ukip plans to balance the current budget ) through this dynamic impact .", 
                "but for that to work the dynamic impact would have to be very high indeed .", 
                "closing the current budget gap ( taking into account ukip 's other spending and tax plans ) requires just over \u00a3 30bn of fiscal tightening - spending cuts or tax rises .", 
                "assuming that around 40 % of any extra gdp flows into the treasury 's coffers as tax , then to close the current budget deficit ukip 's tax plans would have to boost nominal ( cash terms ) gdp by around \u00a3 75bn by 2017/18 .",

                "three years worth of nominal gdp growth would have to be crammed into just two years .",

                "and second , that whilst many investors broadly prefer the policies of the conservatives on a range of issues they are uncomfortable with their stance on immigration an the eu .", 
                "in many ways the current conservative-liberal democrat coalition has been an ideal outcome for the markets - they get the stance on the deficit they want plus market friendly politics coupled with less uncertainty on the uk 's membership of the eu .", 
                "the broad sense that i get is that many city types will be happy when the election is done and dusted and uncertainity recedes .", 
                "markets can then move on from the uncomfortable game of second guessing politicians and get back to their preferred activity of second guessing central bankers ."
