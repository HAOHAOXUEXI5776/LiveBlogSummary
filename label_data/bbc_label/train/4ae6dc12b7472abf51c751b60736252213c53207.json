                "the food standards agency ( fsa ) said yesterday that the scale of the problem was higher than previously thought , with about 700,000 eggs having been sent to the uk from potentially contaminated dutch farms - up from an early estimate of 21,000 .", 
                "in response , asda , morrisons , sainsbury 's and waitrose have withdrawn a total of 11 products - including sandwiches , sandwich fillers and salads - from sale .", 
                "the fsa said investigations suggested it was `` very unlikely '' that the eggs posed a risk to public health as it released a list of processed products withdrawn in the uk `` to ensure that consumers are protected '' .",
