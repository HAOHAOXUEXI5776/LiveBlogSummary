                "ed hutchings , uk sovereign portfolio manager at aviva investors , said : after steadily increasing since late 2015 , owing primarily to the weaker levels of sterling since the eu referendum in mid-2016 , the uk inflation data released today saw cpi recede more than market expectations back to 2.7 % year-on-year in february from a high of 3.1 % just a few months ago in november 2017 .", 
                "looking ahead , it is likely that uk inflation will continue to recede and move further away from letter-writing territory .", 
                "with the uncertainty surrounding brexit negotiations somewhat reduced , the bank of england will be encouraged but likely to proceed with caution when raising interest rates further .", 
                "`` with a may 2018 rate hike now largely priced in by the market , we would expect a further indication of another potential hike from this week 's [ bank of england ] monetary policy committee minutes released on thursday .", 
                "the caveat is that wage gains seriously surprise to the downside tomorrow ,", 
                "with the market now pricing three 0.25 % increases over the next two years , it is likely that any movement in pricing will come down to domestic uk data , as well as global macro-economic and political environment . ''"
