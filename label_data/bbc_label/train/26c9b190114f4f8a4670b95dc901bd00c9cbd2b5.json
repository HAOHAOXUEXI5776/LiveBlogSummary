                "it 's an unusual arrangement which came about because disruption from engineering works at london bridge posed a big financial risk to any train company taking on the southern routes .", 
                "what it also means is that the government has significant influence on the contract and it is understood to be very keen to push through driver only operation ( doo ) .", 
                "with the loss of revenue on tickets , thought to be \u00a3 38m by the end of the year , borne by the taxpayer , southern arguably has less incentive than other companies to end the strikes .", 
                "and on the union side , they know their action ca n't stop the roll-out of doo on southern , which will actually be complete in a couple of weeks ' time .", 
                "but they do n't agree with it and really want it reversed , so there is no deadline after which their industrial action becomes redundant .", 
                "add this to the fact that the government wo n't be in the room at acas and it looks like it could be pretty tough to get a resolution ."
