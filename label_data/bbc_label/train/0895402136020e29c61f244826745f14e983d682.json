                "thank you to derek cullen for getting in touch via your questions to ask : why have the stocks in oakham got five holes instead of four ?", 
                "i tried the local museum , who did n't know , so widened my research and have now managed to get you an answer , or , at least a possible explanation for their use .", 
                "`` five hole stocks are not uncommon although not many now survive , '' according to dr sarah richardson from the university of warwick .", 
                "she added : `` five hole stocks originate from roman times when the arms , legs and head were confined which was more a form of torture than a shaming punishment . ''", 
                "`` more likely with the oakham example is that juveniles or women could have both legs confined to one hole so they could not wriggle free .", 
                "sometimes men were also confined by one leg alone . ''", 
                "dr richardson believes more than one man could be detained at one time , probably on alternative sides ."
