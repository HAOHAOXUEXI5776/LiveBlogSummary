                "we 've taken a `` trawl '' back through the photo archives .", 
                "in 1928 , these scottish fisherwomen were at work on the largest haul of herrings for the season at great yarmouth , with an estimated value of \u00a3 40,000 .",

                "while waiting for the drifters to bring the next catch ashore , there was time for a quick game of draughts .", 
                "this was the scene in october 1934 - piles of fishing baskets , known as swills , wait in readiness for the herring season .", 
                "there are believed to be 19,000 in this one pile .", 
                "the baskets would pile up on the quayside , ready for the driftters to bring in the day 's catch .",
