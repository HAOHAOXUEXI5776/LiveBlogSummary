                "a few music critics have been given an early listen to david bowie 's new album blackstar and have delivered their verdicts .", 
                "blackstar is an album on which words and melody gradually rise from a sonic swamp to sink their hooks in .", 
                "it is probably as close as free jazz has ever got to pop how fantastic to have an album as rich and strange as blackstar that refuses to yield in a few listens .", 
                "'saying no but meaning yes , that is all i ever meant , that 's the message that i sent , ' he sings [ on i ca n't give everything away ] , sounding rather proud of how unknowable he 's become , at the end of an album that counts as unexpected left turn , executed with enviable aplomb , that only deepens the mystery further .", 
                "while at 41 minutes it 's relatively concise considering the lengthy first impression , it 's a strange but thrilling ride where bowie 's fallen back in love with the saxophone and continues to be delightfully unconcerned with getting back on radio .", 
                "the album 's out on bowie 's 69th birthday , 8 january .", 
                "he 's also just released his new single lazarus , which also features in the new off-broadway show of the same name , which bowie has co-written ."
