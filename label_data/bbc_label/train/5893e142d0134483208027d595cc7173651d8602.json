                "we did the programme with denise for a very long time because we started it together , all of us , in 1988 and we left after 13 years and she carried on and chalked up 28 years .", 
                "i 'm not just saying this because i have huge affection for her , but i think she was probably the best agony aunt in the business and was underrated somewhat in that regard .", 
                "she did n't come on with all bells and whistles , she just got on with giving incredibly good advice .", 
                "and what very few people wo n't know is when a show was over , denise would stay in the phone in room sometimes for hours well into the afternoon talking to people who had n't been able to get on the air - or continue counselling people who had and she gave up so much of her time .", 
                "i remember we auditioned some established agony aunts household names and although they were very good they did n't match denise 's authenticity and her genuineness .", 
                "and her obvious serious compassion - she was n't in it for a career , she was in it because she like making a difference to people 's lives for good ."
