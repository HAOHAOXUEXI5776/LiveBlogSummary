                "as a result , 43 non-native marine species have been discovered in channel island waters .", 
                "of those , 25 were found which are `` probably established '' but had yet to be identified , and 66 `` other species '' observed that had the potential to reach the islands and establish themselves .", 
                "according to the study , the channel islands was `` attractive '' to an `` unusually large '' number of foreign marine species from the english channel , north sea and bay of biscay .", 
                "non-native species often arrive in the area via the shallow seabed and strong tidal currents , or with commercial and leisure shipping , the department found .", 
                "judging the likely effect of a newly arrived non-native species is n't straightforward .", 
                "as with so many areas of the environment , by the time the scale of a threat is realised , it can be too late to do anything about it .",

                "we also have strong relationships with neighbouring countries which we can develop and build on to share knowledge and resources . ''"
