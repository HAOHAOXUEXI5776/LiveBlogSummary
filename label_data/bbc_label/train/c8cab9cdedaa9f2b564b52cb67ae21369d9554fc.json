                "as decent a man as aaron mauger is , it 's not clear whether the board ever overlooked his role in the coaching differences with richard cockerill , which led to the director of rugby 's own departure in january .", 
                "the timing of the decision is jarring , especially with further organisational changes promised in spite of mauger 's recent involvement in recruitment .", 
                "not one player recruited by leicester in the three years before his arrival will be at tigers next season .", 
                "it is also striking to see comments from players at a club renowned for not airing its dirty laundry in public .", 
                "what is clear , is that players who were loud on social media when cockerill left have been quieter during mauger 's exit and vice versa .",
