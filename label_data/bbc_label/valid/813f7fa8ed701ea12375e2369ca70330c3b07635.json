                "perhaps you can blame it on election fatigue - it has after all been a very long short campaign .", 
                "but there is little doubt that russell brand , love him or loathe him , carries real heft .", 
                "with 9.5m followers on twitter ( david cameron , by contrast , has just under 1m , ed miliband only 454,000 ) and a youtube channel with over 1m subscribers , brand reaches a demographic - largely young , often disillusioned - that most politicians can only dream of .",

                "the content of the interview , however , was less instructive .", 
                "brand ranted predictably about transnational corporations , hsbc , and `` normal people '' like him .", 
                "it 's hard to resist the temptation at this stage to point out that `` normal people '' do n't have 9.5m twitter followers and the leader of the opposition sitting on their sofa .", 
                "but there we are .", 
                "the questions were often laughably soft - `` are you the man to stand up to the nasty banks , ed ? ''", 
                "you may as well have asked david cameron if he was the man to deliver a long-term economic plan .", 
                "ed was allowed to come across as engaging , affable , with just a touch of that steel he is so keen to remind us he possesses - telling brand he was plain `` wrong '' to suggest that there had been no developments in politics since the suffragettes .", 
                "in all , there was much sound , and little light .", 
                "but from labour 's perspective , that was rather the point .",

                "as the hit counter on russell brand 's interview with ed miliband powers upwards throughout this afternoon , the big question is whether his performance will do anything to drag out that 18-24 demographic who , sadly , have become less likely to vote over the past few elections , as this chart shows :", 
                "as it shows , turnout in 2005 fell below 40 % for the age group before rallying somewhat in 2010 .", 
                "but how important is it for ed miliband to win this group for him to get into downing street in just over a week 's time ?", 
                "look at the table below , which gives the share of the vote for the three main parties in this 18-24 group since october 1974 .", 
                "as you can see , there are only two elections since where the conservatives have won this demographic : mrs thatcher 's initial victory in 1979 and her landslide follow up in 1983 .", 
                "it 's important to mark how the tories were able to eke out substantial victories in both 1987 and 1992 while just losing the youth vote to labour .", 
                "on the other hand , the huge deficits they had during the blair years illustrates that the conservatives ca n't be too phlegmatic about the young vote deserting them .", 
                "a look at current polling paints a pretty bleak for the tories on this front .", 
                "for example , the latest icm poll puts them at 18 % , labour at 51 % and lib dems at just 2 % among the 18-24 group .",

                "mildly astonishing to think that the lib dems might go from near parity with labour in 2010 to near annihilation among young voters this time around .", 
                "so , in many ways ed miliband is playing on fruitful territory by courting the russell brand generation .",
