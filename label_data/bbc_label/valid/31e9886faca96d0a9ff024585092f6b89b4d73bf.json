                "a leading contender to replace south africa 's president jacob zuma as head of the governing african national congress ( anc ) has waded into a controversy about a rape case from over a decade ago .", 
                "mr zuma was acquitted of raping fezekile kuzwayo - the daughter of an old family friend - in 2006 , before becoming president in 2009 .", 
                "now , as the governing anc prepares to choose a new leader , mr zuma 's deputy , cyril ramaphosa , has spoken publically of his concerns about the case .", 
                "talking on a local radio station , mr ramaphosa praised ms kuzwayo 's courage for taking the case to court .", 
                "asked about her allegation of rape , he said : yes , i would believe her . ''", 
                "mr zuma maintained during his trial that he had consensual sex with ms kuzwayo , and a high court judge acquitted him .", 
                "ms kuzwayo fled abroad and later died , but controversy surrounding the case has lingered .", 
                "reaction to mr ramaphosa 's comments has been mixed .", 
                "plenty of south africans believe president zuma has serious character flaws .", 
                "but others point out that mr ramaphosa has served as his deputy since 2014 , and say he 's only speaking out now to enhance his own political fortunes in an increasingly bitter succession battle .", 
                "mr zuma is stepping down as anc leader at its national conference , due to start on 16 december .",
