                "plans to re-draw norfolk 's parliamentary constituencies have been published this morning .", 
                "unlike some parts of the uk , we get off quite lightly .", 
                "the proposals include reducing the number mps from 650 to 600 , but norfolk will still have nine mps , although the size and shape of every seat will change .", 
                "most of the changes are minor but the mid norfolk constituency will lose wymondham ( which goes back to south norfolk ) while south west norfolk will be renamed thetford & downham market and cross the border to take in littleport in cambridgeshire .", 
                "labour 's clive lewis may have to work a little harder to hold on to his norwich south seat which inherits conservative-leaning costessey and cringleford .", 
                "his conservative neighbour , chloe smith , who only has a majority of 507 , might feel a little safer as norwich north will extend into broadland .", 
                "but these are only proposals from the boundary commission .", 
                "the public has one final say on the plans and then they 'll need to be voted on by mps .", 
                "given how much else is going on at westminster , and the fact that these plans do not have cross-party support , it is possible that they 'll never get approved ."
