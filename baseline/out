a report from morgan stanley's european equity team earlier this week warned investors : from a uk investor perspective, we believe that the domestic political situation is at least as significant as brexit, given the fragile state of the current government and the perceived risks of an incoming labour administration that could potentially embark on a radical change in policy direction.
the labour leader's comments come after the us-owned bank released a report warning that the prospect of his party taking power was a bigger threat to the uk economy than brexit.
