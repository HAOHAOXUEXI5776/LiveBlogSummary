if you 've been in the uphill area of lincoln over the last couple of days you 'll have noticed parts of the city are going back in time !
shop windows and displays are being given a wartime feel for lincoln 's 1940s weekend .
there 'll be live music , dancing , vintage tea parties and a flypast of the battle of britain memorial flight .
it all takes place around the cathedral .
michael armstrong from lincoln big , says lots of shops and businesses are getting involved .
we went to all the shops , we 've been giving them flags that they 're using .
it 's great that the shops are really getting on board , got masking tape fro the windows , sandbags and everything !
it 's great when we can get the community involved . ''
