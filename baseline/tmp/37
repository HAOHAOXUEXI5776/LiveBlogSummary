gainsborough trinity were on the wrong end of a seven goal thriller in national league north last night as they lost 4-3 at darlington .
ashley worsfold gave trinity the lead before darlington went 3-1 in front just after half-time .
however goals from ioan evans and nathan jarman looked to have saved a point for the blues before the home side hit a later winner .
manager dave frecklington is not a happy man
i 'm embarrassed to be honest .
embarrassed to put my name to that second half performance .
fuming .
absolutely embarrassing defending .
