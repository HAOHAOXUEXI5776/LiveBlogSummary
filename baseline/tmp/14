the government is seeking further advice from ofcom on rupert murdoch 's Â£ 11.7bn bid for sky after receiving `` new evidence and comments '' .
the department for digital , culture , media and sport ( dcms ) has written to the communications regulator asking for extra input before culture secretary karen bradley decides whether the proposed fox and sky tie-up should face an in-depth investigation .
ms bradley said last month that she was `` still minded '' to refer the takeover to the competition and markets authority ( cma ) following a report by ofcom flagging `` public interest concerns '' surrounding media plurality .
the deal would let rupert murdoch control both 21st century fox and sky while also owning the times , the sunday times and the sun newspapers .
