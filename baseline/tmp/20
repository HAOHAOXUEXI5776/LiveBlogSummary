if someone were to take a photo up a woman 's skirt without them knowing , you 'd think that there 'd be a law to deal with them .
it turns out there is n't .
gina martin ( was at a music festival earlier this year when it happened to her .
but despite the police being helpful and supportive , she says they were unable to prosecute the perpetrators and had to close the case .
she is campaigning to have the offence codified into law .
i want those men to be prosecuted because that 's a horrible thing to happen and it happens way too often .
it 's quite a grey area 'upskirting ' , so i 'm hoping to raise awareness and get the laws codified so that hopefully this would be under the sexual offences act .
lincolnshire 's police and crime commissioner , marc jones , has joined the campaign .
he says the law should be brought into line with `` what we expect '' to protect women and girls from this kind of behaviour :
this particular act needs to be put in as a sexual offence , because it 's quite clearly an invasion of privacy , they 're quite clearly doing it for sexual gratification it would provide the courts with the ability if somebody is prosecuted to put certain things in place to protect the public .
