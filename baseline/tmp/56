lincolnshire police officers have been learning how to pilot remote controlled drones .
it 's hoped that drones could be used to spot criminals , find missing people and help with crime scene investigation .
the force is due to get authority to use the machines by the end of the month .
twenty officers will be trained as pilots .
in future , the drones could be deployed anywhere in the county within 40 minutes .
inspector ed delderfield says it 'll be a really useful tool for them :
we can deploy the drones to all sorts of different things from missing people , suspect searches , crime scene mapping and also to rural crime as [ dealing with ] hare coursing which is a big force priority for us . ''
