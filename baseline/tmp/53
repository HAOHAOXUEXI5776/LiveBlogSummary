a lincolnshire couple who defrauded a 96-year-old neighbour out of £ 400,000 have had their assets confiscated .
jason and rebecca bentley from chapel st leonards are already serving jail terms for the fraud for six and a half years and four and a half years respectively .
today at lincoln crown court , the judge ordered that the bentleys assets of £ 300,000 be confiscated to pay back their victim , patricia reilly .
they switched tens of thousands of pounds at a time into their accounts after gaining control of her bank account and debit card .
they used it to clear their mortgage , pay of credit cards , build an extension to their home and buy a bmw x5 .
the bentleys - who are both 45 and from elliott way in chapel st leonards - were jailed last november after being convicted of fraud .
