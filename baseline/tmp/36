councillors at a public meeting on the future of louth livestock market insist they 're listening to concerns .
the meeting last night was part of a public consultation .
councillors are considering either moving , scrapping or revamping the site .
but some are worried a decision 's already been made .
the next few weeks is very much about feeding into a process that has only just begun .
so no decision has been made , the next big decision will be at council in october so there 's plenty of opportunity for people to feed in their thoughts which will help the council form a view . ''
