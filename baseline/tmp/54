new businesses are ignoring london and moving to other european capitals , according to economist mark dixon .
mr dixon , chief executive of international workplace group , whose turnover in the uk was down 7 % in the past six months , told the today programme : `` occupancy in the uk was down mainly because of london .
`` there is uncertainty in the uk economy and that has affected london first , although we 're seeing quite good demand in the provinces .
`` the level of uncertainty has made companies go to other capital cities - dublin particularly .
`` it is more new people coming in .
world business is a very fluid thing and you 've got companies starting up all the time and some of that flow has gone directly into europe . ''
however , other uk cities are doing well , and mr dixon added : `` we are seeing quite good demand in the provinces .
part of being in the eu made london very expensive and there is more talent now in the provinces than there was before .
`` places like liverpool , brighton and some quite small towns are where companies actually want to establish themselves . ''
