two in five companies in the uk have put their prices up , and a fifth have reduced staff hours or hired fewer workers , in order to cope with the costs of paying the national living wage , according to new research .
the federation of small businesses says not only are firms having to pay their staff more , but some employers face a bigger wage bill because of the knock on effect of having to pay other staff more in comparison .
but some campaigners say that does not go far enough , and are pushing for companies to pay the higher , so-called real living wage ( not the obligatory minimum wage ) .
