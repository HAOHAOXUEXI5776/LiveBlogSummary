a google employee who wrote a controversial memo about workplace diversity has been fired , the bbc can confirm .
the memo broke the firm 's code of conduct , google 's chief executive sundar pichai said on monday in an email to employees .
the memo , shared widely at the weekend , suggested there were fewer women at google because of biological differences .
mr pichai said the text crossed the line because it was `` advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace '' .
entitled google 's ideological echo chamber , the paper argued that `` the abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why we do n't see equal representation of women in tech and leadership '' .
