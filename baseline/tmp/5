belgian ministers are to appear in front of a committee in the country 's parliament to explain their role in a scare involving contaminated eggs .
regulators will also be questioned at the special session , after belgium was accused of being too slow to reveal that traces of a banned pesticide had been found in eggs which then ended up in several other european countries .
the belgian authorities have been accused of sitting on information that eggs had been contaminated with the pesticide fipronil .
it led to farms being closed , and millions of eggs being removed from the shelves in the netherlands and germany .
a very small number reached the uk .
