pets superstore chain pets at home issues a trading statement .
it says although it is early in the year , everything is going to plan .
part of this plan is to cut prices on its regular goods - many of which are found cheaper online .
its `` merchandise '' like-for-like revenue growth is a modest 1.5 % higher .
the money and growth prospects are in the services it can offer through its enticingly named `` groom room salons '' and its vets4pets on-site vet practices .
revenue growth here is 10 times that of merchandise and it is planning another 40-50 of both of these in-store add ons .
online is less of a threat here .
after all , you ca n't neuter a dog ( or cat ) online .
