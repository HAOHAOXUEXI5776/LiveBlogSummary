wake up to money presenter sean farrington asked ihg chief executive keith barr if , after the attacks in london and manchester , he 'd seen a similar hit to tourism in the uk , to that seen in france after terror attacks .
we really have n't ( seen similar hits in london and manchester ) , '' mr barr said .
`` it 's been driven a lot by currency movements , the uk is one of the most affordable destinations it 's been in years .
`` while there 's always some inherent concerns with travel , people are bouncing back quite quickly after events .
we 're seeing a very strong summer . ''
