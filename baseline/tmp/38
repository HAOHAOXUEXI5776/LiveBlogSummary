east lindsey district council has accused bt of delaying the use of the area 's new cctv system .
the council has spent more than Â£ 400,000 to replace its current analogue system with digital cameras .
however they ca n't be used until bt has installed a digital network to support them .
bt has apologised for the delay - saying that engineering turned out to be more complicated than expected .
it also said that they are unable to complete the work at the moment because of restrictions on roadworks during the holiday season .
the council 's deputy leader , graham marsh , says they should have done the work earlier :
i expected nothing less from bt than to try and blame someone else but if they say that the county council is reluctant to give them permits to dig the roads in the summer holidays then fine i understand that .
why did n't they do it between last october and this march ?
