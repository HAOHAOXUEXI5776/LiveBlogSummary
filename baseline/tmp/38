fashion chain new look has reported falling sales and profits for the past few months amid a `` difficult '' market .
the retailer said revenues for the three months to 24 june fell 4.4 % to £ 338.7m , with like-for-like sales in the uk down 7.5 % .
operating profits for the quarter sank 60 % to £ 12.1m .
`` as expected , the uk market has remained difficult , which has resulted in a disappointing quarter of trading , '' said chief executive anders kristiansen .
`` we remain committed to our long-term strategy of diversifying the business and reducing our dependence on the uk high street , and are confident that we will see improvements , but expect these to take time .
`` looking ahead , we expect the consumer economy to remain fragile and challenging market conditions to persist into 2018 . ''
