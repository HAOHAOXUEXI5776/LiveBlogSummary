not everyone 's convinced that the new boss at paddy power betfair is the right one
picking peter jackson as ceo is a brave move when you 're losing someone of breon corcoran 's pedigree .
he 's only held the hot seat at ftse 100-listed worldpay 's uk division since march , and paddy power betfair needs strong leadership now more than ever .
with wider industry issues at play here , the market is yet to be convinced it 's the right move .
