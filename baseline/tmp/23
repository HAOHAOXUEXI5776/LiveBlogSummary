could this be good news for leaseholders ?
leaseholds on properties has been a hot topic recently , with many homeowners complaining of being trapped in unfair agreements .
now , countryside properties , which sold some of the freeholds on its houses to the ground rent company e & j estates , has bought some of them back .
countryside has said it will release owners of those homes from the ground rent agreements .
meanwhile , e & j estates has said it is reviewing all of its leaseholds and is seeking to change them , adding that many of the agreements were `` drawn up by developers '' .
the government announced in july that it wants to ban the sale of `` unfair '' and `` unnecessary '' new leasehold houses .
in april , the housebuilder taylor wimpey apologised over sharply rising leasehold fees and set aside Â£ 130m to deal with the problem .
