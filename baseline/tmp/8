a lincolnshire astronomer says he 's `` disappointed '' by the hype surrounding the perseid meteor shower which happens over the next 24 hours .
paul money , an astronomer based in horncastle , says that although the meteor shower happens over the weekend - making it ideally suited for amateur stargazers - they may be disappointed .
the shower ( above in a time lapse ) happens annually , but some newspapers have said it 'll be a better than average display this year .
it 's a shame it 's been hyped up so much it 's normally one of the most regular and reliable meteor showers we have in the night 's sky each year but every few years we have the moon up at the same time which washes the shower out . ''
paul says that next year 's shower is likely to be one of the best for many years though .
so mark the calendar for 12 august 2018 instead
