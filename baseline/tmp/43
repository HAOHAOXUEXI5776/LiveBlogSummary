is there much of a future for active fund management ?
neil wilson , senior market analyst at etx capital asked the question after standard life 's figures this morning .
he pointed out that standard life suffered Â£ 3.7billion in net outflows in the last six months as its flagship global absolute returns strategies fund `` took a big hit '' .
`` active fund management is not dead but more and more investors are swapping the hefty fees of the star managers in favour of passive investing , '' mr wilson said .
looking ahead to the mega-merger with aberdeen , he added : `` whether the merger pays off , active fund management has to cope with a lot of change .
it 's becoming a tougher sell to investors and fees are falling . ''
